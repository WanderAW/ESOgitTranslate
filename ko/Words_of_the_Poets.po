"\nWhen thrice-blessed Rangidil first saw Abernanit,"
"\nIt burnished silver bright with power and permanence."
"\nA dreadful place with dreadful men to guard it"
"\nWith fever glassed eyes and strength through the Horror."
"\nRangidil saw the foes' number was far greater"
"\nThan the few Ordinators and Buoyant Armigers he led,"
"\nWatching from the hills above, the field and castle of death"
"\nWhile it stood, it damned the souls of the people"
"\nOf Morrowind."
"\nAccursed, iniquitous castle Abernanit."
"\n"
"\nThe alarum was sounded calling the holy warriors to battle"
"\nTo answer villainy's shield with justice's spear,"
"\nTo steel themselves to fight at the front and be brave."
"\nRangidil too grasped his shield and his thin ebon spear"
"\nAnd the clamor of battle began with a resounding crash"

"\nTo destroy the evil of Abernanit."

"\nThe maniacal horde were skilled at arms, for certes,"

"\nEvery slash of Rangidil's blade was deflected away;"

"\nThat no weapon from no warrior found in all"
"\nOf Morrowind"
"\nCould pass the shield of Abernanit."
"\n"
"\nAs hour passed hour, Rangidil came to understand"
"\nHow his greatest warriors met their end with Dagoth Thras."
"\nFor he could exhaust them by blocking their attacks"
"\nAnd then, thus weakened, they were simply cut down."
"\nThe villain was patient and skilled with the shield"
"\nAnd Rangidil felt even his own mighty arms growing numb"
"\nWhile Dagoth Thras anticipated and blocked each cut"
"\nAnd Rangidil feared that without the blessing of the Divine Three"
"\nOf Morrowind"
"\nHe'd die in the tower of Abernanit."

"\nTo explain, he realized that he did not how he did it,"
