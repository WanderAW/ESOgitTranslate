"62156964-0-375","The chaos of Cyrodiil reaches frantic new heights with the arrival of Artifact Weapons!\n\nFor reasons that no sane person can possibly fathom, the Daedric Prince of Madness Sheogorath seems intent on prolonging the conflict in Cyrodiil. To that end, he occasionally sends weapons of great power to Tamriel. Players who take up these weapons have their standard ability bar icons replaced by a suite of new and terrifying Artifact abilities! But these abilities—like all gifts from Sheogorath—come at a cost. Players must feed the weapon Alliance Points to maintain their hold on it. These Alliance Points are tracked in a unique meter found in the player UI. Points acquired from sources other than quests and repairing structures will fuel the weapon.
