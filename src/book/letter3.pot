That's when the hammer hanging over my work table slipped from its hook and bashed both of the poor fellows in the head. Repeatedly. I hope the Khajiit has a good healer on his payroll."

Who does Splendid-Paws think he is? He's not my boss! He's not even an Orc! If he sends his thugs around here again, I can't be held responsible for what happens."

I'm in the middle of establishing a method for redistributing appropriated goods in the town I call home. Turns out, someone already thinks they have that business locked up--and they're angry with me."

I supply the necessary services to meet the ever-growing demands, and if that's a crime then I'm a skinny Wood Elf! But never fear, boss. For you, everything will always be above board and totally honest. For the most part. And you have my word on that!"
