msgid "The valley known as ""The Lion's Den"" was so named because it historically served as a breeding ground for mountain lions. The Nedic peoples of the late Merethic era hunted this population for its furs, but modern inhabitants of the Rift tend to stay clear of the area, finding it easier and safer to harvest the skins and furs of domesticated livestock.\n\nThe local populace undoubtedly began to avoid the Lion's Den early in the Second Era, when a small tribe of giants took up residence in the nearby mountains. These giants have been characterized by locals as angry hermits, and have been known to attack trespassers on sight. For this reason the entrance to the valley was walled off, preventing anyone from accidentally wandering into the area."

msgid "Incorporating Fragment Two \n\nTranslated and With Commentary by Florin Jaliil\n\nThe rolling verdant hills of southern High Rock are unmistakable in the previous verse (Fragment One), recognizable to anyone who has been there. The question, of course, is what is to be made of this apparent reference to Orcs occupying the region. Tradition has it that the Orcs were not born until after the Aldmer had settled the mainland, that they sprung up as a distinct race following the famous battle between Trinimac and Boethiah at the time of Resdayn.\n\nIt is possible that the tradition is wrong. Perhaps the Orcs were an aboriginal tribe predating the Aldmeri colonization. Perhaps these were a cursed folk—""Orsimer"" in the Aldmeris, the same word for ""Orc""—of a different kind, whose name was to be given the Orcs in a different era. It is regrettable that the fragment ends here, for more clues to the truth are undoubtedly lost.\n\nWhat's missing between the first fragment and the second is appreciable. It must be more than eighty months that have passed, because Topal is on the opposite side of mainland Tamriel now, attempting to sail southwest to return to Firsthold, after his failure at finding Old Ehlnofey.\n\nFragment Two:\n\nNo passage westward could be found in the steely cliffs\nThat jutted up like giant's jaw, so the Niben\nSailed south.\nAs it passed a sandy, forested island that promised\nSanctuary and peace, the crew cheered in joy.\nThen exultation turned to terror as a great shadow rose\nFrom the trees on leathered wings like a unfurling Cape.\nThe great bat lizard was large as the ship, but good pilot\nTopal merely raised his bow, and struck it in its head.\nAs it fell, he asked his bosun, ""Do you think it's dead?""\nAnd before it struck the white-bearded waves, he\nShot once more its heart to be certain.\nAnd so for another forty days and six, the Niben sailed south\n\nWe can see that in addition to Topal's prowess as a navigator, cartographer, survivalist, and raconteur, he is a master of archery. It may be poetic license, of course, but we do have archeological proof that the Merethic Aldmer were sophisticated archers. Their bows of layers of wood and horn drawn by silver silk thread are beautiful, and still, I have heard experts say millennia later, very deadly.\n\nIt is tempting to imagine it a Dragon, but the creature that Topal faces at the beginning of this fragment sounds like an ancestor of the cliff-racer of present day Morrowind. The treacherous cliff coastline sounds like the region around Necrom, and the island of Gorne may be where the nest of the ""bat lizard"" is. No creatures like that exist in eastern Morrowind to my knowledge at the present day."

msgid "The Lucky Old Lady\n\nBy Sathyr Longleat\n\nVery little is left of the Ayleid presence in Bravil of today, though architectural marvels of other kinds are very evident. As beautiful and arresting as the Benevolence of Mara cathedral and the lord's palace are, no manmade structure in Bravil is as famous as the statue called The Lucky Old Lady. \n\nThe tales about the Lady and who she was are too numerous to list.\n\nIt was said she was born the illegitimate daughter of a prostitute in Bravil, certainly an inauspicious beginning to a lucky life. She was teased by the other children, who forever asked her who her father was. Every day, she would run back to her little shack in tears from their cruelty.\n\nOne day, a priest of Stendarr came to Bravil to do charitable work. He saw the weeping little girl, and when asked, she told him the cause of her misery: she didn't know who her father was.\n\n""You have kind eyes and a mouth that tells no lies,"" replied the priest after a moment, smiling. ""You are clearly a child of Stendarr, the God of Mercy, Charity, and Well-Earned Luck.""\n\nThe priest's thoughtful words changed the girl forever. Whenever she was asked who her father was, she would cheerfully reply, ""I am a child of Luck.""\n\nShe grew up to be a barmaid, it was said, kind and generous to her customers, frequently allowing them to pay when they were able to. On a particularly rainy night, she gave shelter to a young man dressed in rags, who not only had no money to pay, but was belligerent and rude to her as she fed him and gave him a room. The next morning, he left without so much as a thank you. Her friends and family admonished her, saying that she had to be careful, he might have even been dangerous.\n\nA week later, a royal carriage arrived in Bravil, with an Imperial prince within. Though he was scarcely recognizable, it was the same young man the Lady had helped. He apologized profusely for his appearance and behavior, explaining that he had been kidnapped and cursed by a band of witches, and it wasn't until later he had returned to his senses. The Lady was showered with riches, which she, of course, generously shared with all the people of Bravil, where she lived to a content old age.\n\nNo one knows when the statue to her was erected in the town square, or who the artist was, but it has stood there for thousands of years, since the First Era. To this day, visitors and Bravillians alike go to the Lucky Old Lady to ask for her to bless them with luck in their travails.\n\nJust one more charming aspect of the charming, and very lucky town of Bravil."

Rain and thunderstorms are frequent, but the region is free from the sandstorms of Hammerfell to the west or the monsoons of Black Marsh to the southeast.\n\nMuch has been made of the classical author Heimskr's characterization of Cyrodiil as a jungle or rainforest. My studies indicate that the use of the phrase ""endless jungle"" to describe Cyrodiil appears to be an error in transcription. Close study of the original, badly faded manuscript reveals that the phrase was miscopied, and should be more accurately rendered as ""extensive uplands."" The adjectives ""an equatorial rain"" as applied to the Nibenese forest do not appear in the original manuscript at all, and I would posit were added by the scribe in support of his previous erroneous use of ""jungle."" Lady Cinnabar of Taneth, of course, takes issue with this exegesis, but the flaws in her methods of scholarship have been well-documented elsewhere."

msgid "By Aldous Brousseau\n\nTo the outside observer, the assorted peoples of the region of High Rock known as Glenumbra often seem more similar than different. While it's true that most people in the region take their cues for culture, architecture, food, and dress from a common Breton template, it would be foolhardy to dismiss the cultural differences between the larger populations and the multitude of diverse subcultures present throughout the region.\n\nDaenia: Dominated by the cultural influence of Daggerfall, Daenia is the home and heartland of Breton's quest obsession. For those unfamiliar with the term, it refers to the practice by which young members of the poor and serf classes can partake in heroic tasks to elevate themselves to the ranks of the nobility. The cultural narratives of Daenia are filled with tales of the lowly taking on a great quest to win the respect and accolades of those above them. It is my suspicion that the famed independent spirit of the Daenian people is an extension of this narrative of upward mobility. Of note, this area is also home to the Wyrd subculture, and several witches' covens dedicated to the worship of nature inhabit the vast forests of Daenia.\n\nCambray Hills: Camlorn and its surrounding villages are a hodgepodge of different Breton cultures. The nobility of Camlorn fancy themselves an aristocracy of poets and artists. Often taking a pacifistic tact in the dealings between Daggerfall and Wayrest, Camlorn has benefited much as a go-between for trade and an open market for goods from both Iliac Bay and the Eltheric Ocean. The Cambray Hills are well-known as being haunted, and any given member of the populace usually has a unique ghost story or two to share. The largest subculture of note are the swamp-dwelling Bretons of the eastern bogs that stretch from the Hag Fen to Aldcroft.\n\nKing's Guard: This region is so named for the mountainous ridge that form a natural barrier between Glenumbra, Rivenspire, and Stormhaven. Crosswych is a crossroads for trade moving between these major regions of High Rock, and the place has become a melting pot of dress, food, and culture of the Breton city-states. Not so much a subculture, but a subgroup of note for King's Guard is the Red Rook bandit clan. While the Red Rooks are present throughout Glenumbra, they originated in the mountains and foothills of King's Guard as a loose collection of hunters and highwaymen that preyed upon caravans moving across the pass."

msgid "By Ansur Belote\n\nThere are a number of cities and towns across the region of High Rock known as Glenumbra that a traveler should be familiar with.\n\nDaggerfall: Crown jewel of Glenumbra and one of the oldest cities in High Rock, Daggerfall was the capital of the largest kingdom in High Rock prior to the ascendence of Wayrest. Any traveler would do well to buy provisions in Daggerfall, as the services in the bustling city are second to none.\n\nAldcroft: A small town between the forests of Daenia and the coastal swamplands of the Cambray Hills, Aldcroft has come to prominence in recent years as a key port that services Camlorn from trade routes along the Iliac Bay. Aldcroft is well known for its spicy stews, a treat that I recommend those travelers with weak constitutions to avoid.\n\nCamlorn: A city that has grown in recent times to rival Daggerfall in size and cultural influence, Camlorn is in the west center of Glenumbra. The citizens of Camlorn see themselves as more urbane and metropolitan then their neighbors to the south. Travelers are advised to try Camlorn's excellent pastries and baked goods, as they are worth the trip. Ignore the haughtiness of the locals, as this is just their way and they usually don't mean any offense.\n\nWesttry: This town suffered some great catastrophe in the past that has left it devoid of living citizens and haunted by the dead. The wise traveler would do well to avoid it.\n\nEagle's Brook: Whereas Aldcroft serves as Camlorn's primary connection to Iliac Bay, Eagle's Brook is its corresponding port on the Eltheric Ocean. Many of the artisans and craftsmen that serve the high houses of Camlorn actually live in nearby Eagle's Brook. Travelers are advised to sample the excellent seafood brought in daily by Eagle's Brook's fishing boats.\n\nCrosswych: Straddling the mountainous border pass marking the end of Glenumbra and the beginning of Stormhaven, Crosswych makes much of its gold from the travelers passing back and forth between the two most populous regions of High Rock. Travelers heading to Wayrest from Daggerfall must pass through Crosswych, which is as good a place as any to rest and resupply."

msgid "By Jean Dutheil\n\nGlenumbra is notorious for being haunted. It is important to explain what I mean by haunted. Not every undead is a haunt. Only ghosts can cause a haunting. Ghosts are the spirits of people who were once as alive as you or I. When they died, they refused to leave. \n\n(If at any point you experience the dark effects of necromancy, know that this is not a haunting and should be reported to the proper authorities.) \n\nEveryone in Glenumbra has a tale to tell about a spook, spectre, or haunt. You need only ask. \n\nWithout a doubt the most haunted place in Glenumbra are the moors northwest of Aldcroft. As everyone knows, this was the site of the Battle of Glenumbria Moors in the First Era. This great battle saw the near-simultaneous destruction of both the Alessian Order and the Direnni Elves on one field of battle. Such a tragedy suffuses this place with spectral energy. Wandering the moors, many travelers report hearing the sounds of conflict in the distance.\n\nThe second most haunted place in Glenumbra is directly related to the first. Cath Bedraud and the burial mounds surrounding it began as a mass grave for the fallen soldiers of the battle of Glenumbria Moors. It is advised that you do not stray into the cemetery during times of heavy fog. Ghostly lights and moans have been reported there.\n\nWhile some consider the woodlands of Daenia to be haunted, this is actually a misconception. Many spirits of nature, including the famed Guardians, inhabit the vale and forest. These are not ghosts, for they were never people. These creatures were born as spirits and should be treated with the respect they deserve.\n\nHearkening from Glenumbra's past of feudal division, the countryside is dotted with ruins and castles, each of which you could probably find someone to tell you a spooky story about. In particular, the ruins at Baelborne Rock and Dresan Keep have many a local legend surrounding them. \n\nOf all the haunted sites in Glenumbra, I would give strongest caution against a trip to the village of Westtry. Westtry suffered some form of terrible magical event that has left it infested with the undead. It is not safe, nor would I suggest anyone go ghost hunting there."

Translations of tapestries in the Crystal Tower tell the tale of a far older separation. The Maormer likely differentiated from the ancient Aldmer not in Summerset, but in their original homeland of Aldmeris.\n\nOrgnum, their leader and self-styled ""King,"" according to the legend was a phenomenally wealthy Aldmeri nobleman, who used his fortune to finance a rebellion against the powers of the land. He and his followers were banished for this to a place separated from Aldmeris by an impenetrable mist, Pyandonea, ""The Mist-Veiled Isles."" This exile proved so effective that the followers of Orgnum never again disturbed their former countrymen. The new Aldmeri homeland of Summerset, however, was not so lucky.\n\nFor much of Summerset's history, the Maormer have launched attacks against their cousins of Old Ehlnofey. Every one of these battles has been led by Orgnum himself, who it seems is not only immortal but grows more youthful by the century. No historian, to the knowledge of the staff of the Imperial Geographic Society, has counted the number of wars and stratagems employed against Summerset, but somehow each has proved, no matter how ingenious, an ultimate failure.\n\nOne attack in particular is worthy of mention as it gives us our only glimpse into the actual landscape of Pyandonea. In the year 2E 486, a small Maormeri fleet was sighted off the coast of Alinor, and King Hidellith ordered his navy to give chase. The navy followed the ships through uncharted waters, into an ambush near Pyandonea itself. Most of the Altmeri navy was destroyed, but a single warship returned to Summerset to describe the land as a ""sea jungle."" Massive plateaus spilling over with vegetation form mazes around valleys of ocean. Waving tendrils of kelp trap all but the Maormer's own ships, and provide a well-camouflaged home for the sea serpents that are Orgnum's guards and occasional mounts. Mist storms spill over the land, further disorienting one's views. That even one ship survived the visit is a testament to the maritime genius of the Altmer."

I have studied these lumbering creatures and watched them tend their mammoths. They are peaceful, simple beings. Not all have given in to their battlelust. Not all have given in to the need to explore that drives every Nord I have ever known.\n\nBut nonetheless, we are connected to these giants, for we both share a common ancestor. The Atmorans were huge and smart. Nords descended from these ancient folk became the small (relatively speaking), intelligent people that we are today. Giants, on the other hand, became the huge, stupid creatures that we watch from a distance. Once we honored our cousins with offerings of cows, but this practice has fallen out of favor. Perhaps that is to the detriment of Nord villages everywhere.\n\nToday, most Nords refuse to acknowledge the obvious connection between us and the giants. We treat the giants as a nuisance, steal their grazing lands, and even hunt their mammoths for sport. This will be our undoing. To disrespect the giants is to disrespect ourselves. If we can't learn to live with our huge cousins, I fear that conflict could become all-out war. And that would be a shame.\n\nLet me tell you more about the giants. In general, they tend to be solitary creatures. The giants do gather regularly at a ceremonial site. Here, they come together to trade, mate, and communicate with whatever simple methods they have developed. \n\nThey have a curious relationship with their mammoths. They don't herd these creatures, but they seem to be able to communicate with them. They protect them, and in return, they get milk, cheese, and companionship. On occasion, I have seen a giant eat a mammoth. The meal was conducted with reverence, if such a concept can be applied to a simple giant.\n\nGiants also demonstrate intricate beliefs regarding death. They have places set aside as sacred burial grounds. When a giant is sick or dying, he or she goes to one of these places to die. If a giant dies elsewhere, other giants make sure the body gets to the burial ground. They don't live near these sacred locations, and they don't guard them. They simply make use of them.\n\nGiants and Nords continue to vie for some of the same territories. Future conflict is inevitable unless we take steps to find peaceful solutions. Giants fall, and Nords die, but I have never seen a giant eat a Nord."

They have their world beyond the fires of our villages, and we have ours. Yet at times like these, when sleep eludes me and the haunting howls fill the night, our two worlds merge. As long as that merging remains figurative, I can sit here and listen and dream.\n\nAnd thank Mara's heart they have no desire to come closer to our homes and hearths … for this night, at least."

msgid "Centuries ago, before the Ra Gada crossed the sea to the land upon the beaches of Hammerfell, the ancestors of the modern Redguard people lived upon the continent of Yokuda. The ruling body of the Yokudan people, known as the Na-Totambu, was a council of kings whose respective nations birthed magnificent advances in metallurgy, agriculture, and shipbuilding unknown even in modern times.\n\nWhen the continent of Yokuda sank beneath the waves in a great cataclysm, the Na-Totambu moved their system of government and surviving people across the sea in the fearsome Ra Gada. Even as depleted as they were by the cataclysm, the Redguards slashed through the deserts and hills to establish their nation anew, conquering Breton, Altmer, and Orc with little trouble.\n\nAs the decades passed, the influence of the Na-Totambu faded and Redguard society split into two primary cultural factions. The Forebears, generally considered the more adaptable of the two, opened trade with former enemies and maintained the coastal ports. Inland, the Crowns still held much of the power and strongly adhered to the ancient Yokudan tenets.\n\nDespite this fanatical veneration, much Yokudan knowledge was lost to time and feuds between the factions. The eldest Crown scholars scathingly chide the modern Redguards as mere cultural shadows of their ancestors."

msgid "…in Five Easy Steps!\n\nGuar have much more complex inner lives than many give them credit for. We know they can be trained to carry packs, and we love them for their docile nature, but what do we really know about our relationship with these steadfast beasts? In my years working with guar, I have discovered that they have a much greater capacity for learning than we could ever expect. My studies have yielded what I believe are some of the best methods for guar training, useful whether you are interested in studying them in-depth or just in getting ol' Rollie to stop chewing on your sandals.\n\n1. Demonstrate\nMake sure to clearly show your guar what you intend for him to do for you. Make sure to hunch over and look as much like a guar as possible. Studies have shown that just by watching, guar can learn the basics of a task. Keep his attention by carrying a bit of food that is of interest while you perform the task.\n\n2. Command\nClearly, slowly state the command word you wish to associate with the demonstrated behavior. Say it over and over again as you show your guar the correct way to do the task. Sometimes I find that yelling helps, as it startles the guar into paying closer attention (though it may also make him skittish).\n\n3. Watch\nAfter you have demonstrated what you wish your guar to do while repeating the command word, watch for the guar to make an attempt. Continue saying the command word and continue to the next step every time he makes a move in the correct direction. This can take hours or days, so be prepared to watch for a while.\n\n4. Reward\nGive your guar a reward even for incremental progress, such as nudging a bucket you wish him to carry. Training can be difficult, and rewarding every bit of progress will help your guar stay motivated.\n\n5. Repeat\nIt may take weeks for you to fully teach your guar a new task, so stay patient. Train every day, and by following these steps, you'll have the best-trained guar in the district!"

msgid "By Phrastus of Elinhir\n\nIt is an indisputable fact that necromancy, the foulest of all magical endeavors, is on the rise. Word of unsettled spirits, shambling corpses, and worse spreads across Tamriel, planting seeds of fear in common folk. There is good reason to be concerned, and it is my scholarly duty to inform the ignorant in hopes that a more educated populace will be better prepared to recognize and face undead dangers.\n\nNecromancy, as you likely know, is the manipulation of souls, soul energies, or corpses of the dead. Unwilling spirits are often involved, and in the eyes of any rational being, the ""study"" of this type of magic is repellant. It should not be surprising to you that much knowledge of necromancy is attributed to Daedric forces, specifically those of the abhorrent Molag Bal, further cementing it as a sphere that must be shunned. \n\nI present to you now an accounting of the general types of undead:\n\nThe Reanimated\n\nThese monstrosities are formed when a necromancer summons and instills an enslaved spirit, often a minor Daedric essence, into a corpse or construct of bodies. Reanimations take many shapes, from the lowly skeleton (favorite of novice necromancers) to the hulking flesh atronach. The need for unconsecrated corpses poses a danger to communities, as it is known to drive wayward mages to murder in their lust for power. To minimize encounters with reanimations, avoid poorly-kept graveyards and hidden caves or ruins, and report any suspicion of necromancy to your local authorities for investigation.\n\nThe Returned\n\nGhosts, wraiths, and spectres manifest for a variety of reasons. Some are bound to Nirn through powerful curses, some are summoned forth through rituals, and others find their souls unable or unwilling to depart due to unfinished business. Some are even ancestors bound by their own families, a practice the Dark Elves claim is not necromancy at all—guarwash! \n\nMy recent studies into the phenomenon known as the Soulburst indicate a tie between it and a surge in returned sightings and activity, strongly implicating a persistent disruption in natural post-extant soul conveyance. Detractors to this theory, notably the misguided Lady Cinnabar of Taneth, have yet to produce any counter-theories that do not crumble under the slightest scrutiny.\n\nThe Accursed\n\nUndeath is not always a product of renegade mages tampering with souls and rotting flesh. Cursed diseases such as Noxophilic Sanguivoria can corrupt the living. The result is an undead creature that requires the blood of the living for sustenance. Vampires have a tendency to organize into reclusive clans, hiding away beneath the ground and surfacing only to obtain more thralls to feed upon. In some cases, though, their minds are known to degrade to the point of insanity, leaving a raging husk of a creature with no mental capacity commonly called a ""bloodfiend."" Any sightings of such creatures should be reported to a local Fighters Guild. \n\nAbominable Miscegenations \n\nSome undead defy simple classification. The lich, for one, is a corpse that is self-reanimated by the soul it bore in life. Typically, only powerful spellcasters seeking immortality achieve this state. Luckily for common folk, liches are often focused obsessively on continuing their own studies, and they are not likely to be encountered by travelers that keep their noses out of ancient ruins. \n\nNow that you are more informed about this vile art and its repellent products, hopefully you are better-prepared to assess undead threats. It goes without saying (though I will certainly say it) that we all have a responsibility to report and combat necromancy, especially in these times. Do not let anyone convince you that there is some kind of benefit to be had in exploring these detestable magics—any reasonable individual can see the madness in such a claim."

msgid "By Garric the Pilot\n\nWhat's that? You want to know about the Glenumbra Banks? I thought everyone knew about those shifting sand bars off the northwest coast of High Rock, the narrow islets that make seafaring there so dangerous close to shore. I myself have made a living for almost thirty years as a Daggerfall pilot, guiding merchant ships through the Banks in and out of the city's North Docks. And I'm well paid for the job, but the merchants don't complain—they see the rotting spars and twisted planks of the shipwrecks we pass as we wend our way through the channels. \n\nThose channels are treacherous and ever-changing. When we go out in early Sun's Dawn to meet the first ship coming in to port after the winter storms, there are always numerous visible changes to the waterways—as well as invisible changes to their depths, which we must take care to map out by frequent use of the plumb-line. \n\nBut the fact is we must be ever on the lookout for changes in the Banks even in Mid Year and Sun's Height. Now, how is it that the sands shift the way they do, sometimes changing overnight even when there has been no storm? The Herne Current runs far offshore, and in summer the breeze the mariners call the Yokudan Zephyr blows steadily but gently from the west. \n\nAnd yet, the sands shift, and the Banks change. \n\nWell, stranger, I'll tell you the secret, so long as you're buying the drinks tonight in the Rosy Lion. It's Ithguleoir. Yes, you heard me right—the immortal leviathan of the Eltheric Ocean is no mere fable. Ithguleoir lives, and haunts the far depths of the sea … and sometimes the near shallows of the shore. He fills old channels in the Banks and dredges new ones. And when a ship runs aground on the sands, he rises from the waters and dines on its sailors, one by one. \n\nI suppose you're entitled to look skeptical about that—so long as you buy another round, that is. But listen, I'm not just spinning an old salt's yarn. I've seen the thing. On nights when the moons are full and the sea is calm, you can sometimes glimpse the leviathan's oily back heaving above the surface as the old monstrosity digs his devious traps. Occasionally there's a geyser of sea-mist, like when a whale blows, but then the breeze wafts ashore a demonic stench that smells like it's blown from Oblivion. \n\nSo there: now you know. But let's just keep this between you, me, and the tavernkeeper's cat, shall we? The south harbor's too shallow for the big merchantmen, and Daggerfall depends on her sea-trade continuing to find its way in to the North Docks. As do I. And sailors are such a superstitious lot—no point in scaring them away. Eh?"

msgid "By Luruk gro-Bozgor\n\nWhen passing through the holds and camps of men and mer, it is important to remember their sense of justice is not as immediate as the Code of Mauloch demands. A thief in Daggerfall, for example, might expect to be imprisoned for a number of days. By comparison, a murderer might sit for years in a dank cell awaiting some petty lord to decide his guilt.\n\nBe therefore careful in exacting your wrath upon those who wrong you. Though swift justice is to be lauded among civilized people, it is often misinterpreted as brawling—or worse, grievous assault—where local custom is used to a less efficient response.\n\nSimilarly, the rules of such far off lands do not appreciate—or even allow—challenges from below. Where single combat is a commonly accepted remedy for poor leadership among our own people, less civilized societies have yet to discover its practical efficiency, and will frequently allow others to demonstrate their strength for them.\n\nTake care, then, in voicing your opinion among such folk, for it may be swiftly and violently struck down. Instead, find others who share your beliefs and let your numbers carry you to victory.\n\nFinally, the arts of fine craftsmanship are often stunted in far-off lands. Though the Elven peoples of Summerset and Vvardenfell have some grasp of refined forging, the men of Cyrodiil and the far north do not. In some of the more benighted areas, they even view unalloyed iron as an acceptable metal for working arms and armor.\n\nBe not afraid to best their backward practices. Your efforts will bring respect and admiration upon our people, and your name will spread far and wide."

This is but an abstract to satisfy your curiosity until the scribes can finish their work. \n\nCommon Vvardenfell Guar\n\nGuar are but the most commonly-known species of a large family of bipedal, lizard-like creatures, having been imported to Cyrodiil as beasts of burden for hundreds of years. They are content to graze with their lower jaws for tubers and roots just under the surface of their ashland home. Wild guar are mostly docile, but have been known to become feral and attack in the wilds of some lands. Guar are fierce if provoked, and have been known to kill. Their closest relatives are the Alit and Kagouti, also common in the lands of Morrowind, as well as the pony guar. \n\n""Pony Guar,"" as nicknamed by visitors to Morrowind, are a smaller species of guar that are rarely exported since they lack the physical strength of their larger cousins. Not well known outside of southern Morrowind, they are a curiosity sometimes raised as pets, but some do raise them for their meat and skins. \n\nAlit and Kagouti\n\nAlit are close relatives to the guar, with far sharper sets of teeth. They are omnivores and while they do not hunt in organized packs, they have been known to attack other creatures and even people for an opportunistic meal. Alit supplement their nutrition, much like the guar, by rooting. For many years, it became the vogue for exotic animal enthusiasts from Valenwood to import alit for their own amusement. Many escaped captivity, and their descendants can be found stalking the great forests of the southwest. \n\nKagouti are large, armored cousins of the guar and the alit. Their most distinctive features are their tusks and head crests. They are territorial, fierce, and hostile. They hunt in packs and have been known to be able to flip a full-grown Nord in the air with ease. \n\nScuttler and Bantam Guar\n\nThe scuttler is a small, docile species of biped the size of a common housecat. They have no apparent forelegs, and survive on eating smaller insects and groundworms. Having completely different reproductive and growth cycles, they are not related to the guar or alit. Scuttlers are more similar to the cliff racer family of leathery flyers than their form would suggest. Smugglers have sold them as pets in ports from Daggerfall to Haven. \n\nBantam Guar, despite their name, classify as a part of the scuttler family and are not guar at all. Many have described them as ""ugly chickens,"" as they have a distinctive body shape and behavior that remind many of the common bird. They retain the vestigial wings, and unlike their cliff racer and cliff darter cousins, they cannot fly. Southern Morrowind farmers raise them for their eggs and meat."

No scholars agree on who founded the town, but we do know Cormount's population and cultural significance grew tenfold shortly before the end of the Long Truce.\n\nCormount's quiet surroundings and distance from the Wood Elf seat of power made it an ideal hideaway, especially for the Camoran factions. Over the years the cream of the Bosmer nobility took lovers in Cormount. But secrets are like seeds—if you try to bury them, they will one day burst forth.\n\nIn 2E 406, a scandal rocked the Camoran factions when it was revealed that Cormount might be the source of dozens upon dozens of potential heirs, most of whom were of marriageable age. Cormount nearly doubled its population in one week as opportunists, the curious, and the cunning arrived in town. For months thereafter, weddings were a daily occurrence.\n\nThis rumor also drew many young Wood Elves who lived outside of Valenwood. They traveled to the Kingdom of Grahtwood with the hopes of binding their Imperial fortunes to their spiritual home. Those who found Grahtwood agreeable founded a ramshackle village near Cormount called New Joy.\n\nThe settlers were known as ""migrants"" by the Grahtwood natives who had first arrived in Cormount. These adherents to the Green Pact were shocked by the Cyrodilic customs of their wayward cousins. Meanwhile, the migrants flaunted the ""backwoods"" nature of the natives, seeking easy pleasures in the trade that flowed through Cormount.\n\nTensions between Cormount and New Joy grew to a boiling point in the years to follow. It is unknown who cast the first torch, but one dark night in 2E 420 the settlement of New Joy was burned to the ground. Those who fled were slain—including a visiting Camoran noble.\n\nThough none took credit for this massacre, it was widely assumed the work of Green Pact adherents of Cormount. In the few short years before the end of the Long Truce, Camorans looking to air their grievances frequently used the Razing of New Joy as a political cudgel.\n\nBut Cormount should not be known for this one stain on its reputation. Founded in 2E 489, the Blacksap Movement has grown in popularity throughout Grahtwood. This Cormount-based cultural organization hopes to formalize the Wood Elf approach to the Green Pact, thereby preventing the very misunderstandings that led to the tragic events of New Joy. As we enter the fifth century of our era, Cormount's rise seems all but assured. This author can only hope the Blacksap rises with it!"

Eventually Zantonius was assigned a post in northern Valenwood, where he would prove he had a tactical mind matching the greatest generals of the Second Empire!\n\nOne dark night in the month of Second Seed, while Zantonius stood ever-vigilant watch in Reman's Bluff, he single-handedly stopped a Wood Orc raid upon his camp! For his merits in battle, Zantonius was given command of a cohort of soldiers and sent to build a fort for the glory of the Empire. At the head of these troops, Zantonius marched south into the Kingdom of Grahtwood.\n\nIt was the beautiful plot of land at the southernwestern tip of Grahtwood where Zantonius thrust the point of his spear into the soil. ""From this day forward, I declare this land to be known as Southpoint. Though sent to build a stronghold of Imperial might, I will instead built a fortified town! All in the Kingdom of Grahtwood will know Southpoint's name.""\n\nCan anyone doubt Governor Zantonius' word? He has given the citizens of Southpoint strong walls, swift response to Bosmer insurrectionists, and a port that sees far more ships than the backwater trading post of Haven. Next month, Governor Zantonius shall break ground on what will one day become the greatest cathedral in Valenwood!\n\nWhy, every citizen of Southpoint owes Governor Zantonius for their safety, security, and prosperity! We shall support him in his rightful stewardship of Southpoint, his valiant efforts to make Southpoint the center of Imperial culture in Valenwood, and the increase in taxes which shall take effect at month's end. Though we owe so much to Governor Zantonius for our town, all he asks in return is our loyalty, our comity, and one gold for every twelve earned.\n\nFor the Empire!"

msgid "The tale of Faltonia's Promise, or Goldfolly as it's commonly known, is a tale of divination, greed, and foolishness. If you go to Grahtwood you can still see what remains of the village, a run-down testament to the hubris of one woman, Faltonia Salvius.\n\nLike many Imperials, Faltonia Salvius saw an opportunity to extract great wealth from Grahtwood. Specifically, she sought rich veins of gold from the nearby hills. She trusted diviners and alchemists of the lowest order, false advisors who were happy enough to tell her what she wanted to hear as long as their own purses grew fat.\n\nThe more she paid them, the more willing she was to believe their lies. When one lone voice, the alchemist Flavius Antonius, argued that the samples of soil from the area were insufficient to predict large deposits of gold, she had him arrested and beaten. From that point, he was unable to walk and was forced to beg for his supper for the rest of his miserable days.\n\nFaltonia traveled to Grahtwood in springtime with a band of Imperial guards numbering four-and-twenty, and proceeded to conscript local Wood Orcs as labor in the fulfillment of her grand vision. By midsummer, a village had been constructed on her chosen site, called Faltonia's Promise, and the Orcs were set to work in the mine.\n\nHow the gold flowed! How quickly eager prospectors flooded Faltonia's Promise, dreaming of riches! How forcefully their dreams were dashed, when within the year the mine was played out. ""Faltonia's Promise"" became the punchline to a bitter joke told in taverns by out-of-work miners.\n\nHumbled but undaunted, Faltonia fought to save the settlement. Seeking to turn the mining operation into a quarry, she haggled and negotiated with nearby Haven to supply stone for the reconstruction of their crumbling buildings. But just as the deal was about to be completed, a smooth-talking Altmer canonreeve convinced the governor to supply Haven with stone from Summerset, emphasizing the superior style and durability of island stone.\n\nBroken, and having spent the last of her fortune in a failed attempt to bribe the officials in Haven and secure the stone deal, Faltonia left the village that had been named for her. Many who had settled there in pursuit of riches soon followed, dispersing to other settlements in Grahtwood, or leaving entirely. So it was that Faltonia's Promise came to be referred to, far and wide, as Goldfolly.\n\nThe Orcs who remained eked out a living as hunters and grew into a stubborn stock, the sort who saw it a badge of honor that they persisted in a place that had driven so many away. On their lips, the name Faltonia's Promise once again took on positive connotations, of persistence, strength, and an indomitable spirit, thought the village would never reach the heights of Faltonia's foolish dreams."

And that is about all scholars can agree upon when it comes to the strange case of the Ragnthar ruins. \n\nEven laypeople know that the Dwemer, or Dwarves as they're more commonly known, vanished from the face of Tamriel. The reasons or cause behind their disappearance are a matter of much speculation … a subject for numerous other texts.\n\nWhat is not in dispute is what they left behind: numerous ruins, some still patrolled by their unique metal constructs. Exploring a Dwarven ruin is seen in many research and adventuring circles as a rite of passage, as even the most well-trod ruin might still contain dangers. As a result, there's a large body of work on the subject of Dwemeri ruins and their eccentricities. \n\nTo be sure, there are a number of unusual finds within the ancient Dwarven holdfasts. Towering machinery, shafts that allow sunlight to reach thousands of feet below ground, roaring waterfalls powering still-active and incomprehensible machinery … there are many ruins that are stunning to the eye and the senses.\n\nNone of them match Ragnthar when it comes to stunning the mind. For you see, Ragnthar has numerous entrances spread across Tamriel. It is literally a space-out-of-space, twisted out of reality. Its physical location is actually unknown! Observations made within the site suggest it once was situated within the mountains of Hammerfell, but a precise origin point has never been determined.\n\nWhat is known is that by stepping across the threshold into Ragnthar, you leave Nirn. And no one knows why. \n\nFor indeed, the greatest question posed by Ragnthar is: why? Why would the Dwemer expend the enormous amounts of magical energy required to remove a complex from known reality? I call this effort a ""Temporospatial Claudication,"" literally a twisting of time and space.\n\nHerein you'll find this humble scholar's numerous observations about the site. I've extensively studied the remaining constructs and machinery here, as well as made numerous suppositions about the intent of its creators. I think you'll agree, the more we learn about the site, the more there is to uncover!"

msgid "By Charonius of Sutch\n\nReaper's March has a long and bloody history. Its denizens have had ample need for a place to bury their dead. For the most respected, the rich, the powerful, that final resting place has often been the crypt known as Thibaut's Cairn. \n\nLocated southwest of the village now called Greenhill, the old Colovian crypt and the nearby village once shared a name. But … we're getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nThe Cairn is named for its most noted ""guest,"" the famed Thibault of Kvatch. Thibault was a general of Colovia, and in his time some hundreds of years ago he was one of the anchor points for the Hastrel Cohort. \n\nThose brave souls rode forth at the vanguard south, beside their comrades in the Linchal and Ontus cohorts. The purpose of their ride has been forgotten, just one of the numerous sorties into the March the Colovian kingdoms have attempted over the years.\n\nTheir ride would have been lost forever to the mists of time, if not for the unique relationship Thibault had with his cohort. Riding at his side south from the Kingdom of Kvatch was his wife Tertcia. Below Thibault in the command structure of his cohort were his children, though the number he had in place has now been lost to time. The members of his cohort owed him personal allegiance to a degree not often seen in modern Colovian cohorts. It's said when Thibault rode, even the nightsoil men of his township rode with him.\n\nThe details of Thibault's death, too, have been lost to us … but the impact of his death is still easy to see if you travel south of Arenthia in the Northern Woods. While the Linchal and Ontus cohorts rode back north, returning to home soil, the men and women of Hastrel cohort stayed and put down roots. \n\nTertcia's need to see her husband's legacy built was the motive for staying. The tales of her manipulations can be found in numerous other tomes, no doubt. Suffice it to say that she played the Wood Elves against the Khajiit and the Khajiit against the Wood Elves in a masterful dance. The result? A complex of crypts and an entire village, once known simply as ""Thibault's Rest"".\n\nNow, the history of that little town is an interesting tale as well …"

msgid "By Denogorath the Dread Archivist\n\nOrdinary flame atronachs have been forbidden in our realm since that cretin Markynaz Zexxil conjured one in the palace and its heat damaged Dilogene's ""Ice Fangs No. 4,"" one of the Master's favorite sculptures. Their banishment, however, left a certain hard-to-define gap in our realm's carefully-balanced esthetic of beautiful pain—an absent voice, if you will, from our chorus of terror and despair. \n\nI admit it: I missed the way their lissome forms curveted and twirled at the edge of vision, their expressions blank of all emotion but for the avid hunger of the arsonist. I thus made it my purpose, when the duties of my office could spare me, to find a substitute for the exiled flame atronachs, some other conjurable entity that would replace the charismatic peril of their presence.\n\nAvailing myself of the spare transliminal scanner stored in the Tower of Lies, I set myself the task of reviewing by survey all the Oblivion planes within range of its infralux pseudocortex. I scanned over 37,000 different planes, chaos realms, and pocket realities before I found what I was looking for in DOP 9497.15, known to its curious inhabitants as ""The Fourth Sinus of Takubar."" I immediately recognized the plane as a sort of decalescent inversion of DOP 6, ""Infernace,"" well known to conjurers of all races as the home plane of the common flame atronach. In place of the extreme heat of Infernace, where molten rock flows like water, in Takubar (as we may call it for the sake of brevity) the bedrock is subjected to a cosmic degree of cold, causing its material bonds to slide apart and the stone to flow like cold lava. \n\nIt was there in Takubar that I finally saw, in the insect-eyed lenses of the transliminal scanner, images of gyrating atronachs that burned with cold blue flames. I had found what I sought.\n\nAfter that, modifying Koron's Peremptory Summons to address Takubar rather than Infernace was a matter of mere routine. Within seven shifts I had succeeded in summoning what we may term a ""cold-flame atronach"" to Coldharbour. As anticipated, rather than giving off unpleasant waves of heat, this was an elemental of cold fire, and there was a steep drop in ambient temperature in its presence. \n\nThis, of course, was all to the good. \n\nIn behavior my cold-flame atronach behaved in all ways like an ordinary flame atronach—and was just as irritable, casting blue fireballs at any who threatened it, and conjuring pillars of cold flame at need. This perfectly fills the niche of hovering sentry formerly filled in Coldharbour by their igneous cousins, and that is the main function they now fulfill in our Master's realm."

msgid "By Phrastus of Elinhir\n\nWe come now to consideration of the spriggan, the elusive, feminine nature spirit of the deep woods. Of course, we all know the name from the taunting children's joke that goes:\n\n""Guess what?""\n\n""What?""\n\n""Spriggan butt!""\n\n…But beyond this juvenile jest, what can scholarship tell us about these half-flora/half-fauna creatures? Unfortunately, though I have consulted all the standard sources, the academics of Tamriel have little to say about the spriggans' whys and wherefores. \n\nFrom both legend and from authenticated stories of personal encounters, we know that spriggans are somehow mystically tied to certain copses or thickets, verdant groves which they fiercely defend against trespassers. Spriggan sap is said to be venomous, and they are known to be able to magically heal themselves when wounded, making them dangerous opponents.\n\nIn addition, spriggans have some sort innate connection to the animals and plants that inhabit their sacred groves, and there are many verified accounts of animals fighting at their sides against intruders. These allies include not just animals that are naturally aggressive, such as bears or swarms of hornets, but even usually timid creatures like deer and elk. \n\nWhether these animal allies defend spriggans out of love or friendship, or whether they are magically summoned by an innate spell ability on the part of the spriggan, is an open question, and a matter of some debate among those who study mystizoology. There is no doubt, however, that spriggans are creatures of a magical nature, as is clearly evidenced by the powerful qualities of the so-called ""taproots"" that are harvested from their bodies when slain. These taproots are prized by alchemists for their undeniable arcane properties, which enable the concoction of complex potions from powerful reagents that are otherwise immiscible. \n\nAs to their origins, that is a mystery that so far none have solved. We find accounts of ""Spryggain Groaves"" dating all the way back to the beginning of the First Era, as well as mention of ""tree-daughters"" in the ancient myths of Y'ffre and the Earth Bones. Their common name seems to derive from ""sprig,"" the Nedic term for a fresh green twig or offshoot, but beyond that everything about their origins is obscure.\n\nFrom a purely physical standpoint spriggans certainly come in several forms, with reports of a variety of barks and foliage. This may represent different strains or sub-species, or it may simply be a reflection of the spriggan's mystical connection with its local flora. Spriggans seem to resemble the plants of the groves wherein they live, even reflecting the seasonal nature of those who reside in the deciduous forests of northern Tamriel. In the opinion of this scholar, the so-called spring, summer, autumn, and winter spriggans are all the same creatures merely undergoing seasonal metamorphosis.\n\nSome have gone so far as to assert that spriggans have a hierarchy, with lesser members of the species owing allegiance to the greater, who are sometimes termed ""spriggan matron"" or even ""spriggan earth mother."" Here is where we must draw the line between scholarship and storytelling: though a spriggan's form outwardly resembles that of a human female, there is no evidence whatsoever that they can engage in intelligent behavior, or that they can organize into hierarchical groups. The creatures of the natural world, even those that are quasi-magical, behave entirely according to instinct, and to endow them with human emotion or thought is mere sentimentalism. If you're partial to that sort of fanciful twaddle, I refer you to the works of Lady Cinnabar of Taneth, who produces it in great reams."

Some are even said to have wings, though the idea of these hulking brutes taking to the air is hard to credit. But where do they come from, and why? Read on, for this great mystery at last has a solution!\n\nTales of gargoyles are widespread across Tamriel, but few can claim to have actually seen one. (Have you ever seen one? Has anyone you know ever seen one? I didn't think so. And I'm rarely wrong about such things. As you know if you've read my other pamphlets. If you haven't read my other pamphlets you are sadly under-informed, and have missed out on several life-changing money-making opportunities. You would be wise to correct this deficiency.) \n\nBut back to the business at hand: gargoyles! They're few and far between. However, it is well known that they can be found deep in the depths of the deserts of Hammerfell, hunkering atop crumbling crags as they gaze balefully down upon their potential prey, preparing to dive and rend it with their stony, taloned hands! Is it any wonder few have survived to tell of such an encounter? \n\nAt any event: Hammerfell, depths of the deserts thereof, that's where we find our elusive gargoyles! But gargoyles are not the only legendary denizens of the depths of the deserts, are they? No! In fact, according to long-time Redguard legend, when those doughty warriors first arrived on the shores of Tamriel they found the deserts of Hammerfell occupied by—Giant Goblins!\n\nGiant Goblins! Goblins, but giant-sized! In other words: great misshapen humanoids, gray-green of skin, with gnarled, tusked faces, horns, and pointed ears. Where have we heard that before …?\n\nRevelation! Epiphany! You get it, do you not? Take a look at a Goblin, then look at a gargoyle—very well, look at a picture of a gargoyle, because as I believe we've established none of us have ever seen one in person—but anyway, just look at them! Can such a resemblance be a coincidence? Well, I don't know about you, but my mother didn't raise anyone that gullible! Coincidence? My eye! It's as plain as their tusky faces that the Hammerfell Giant Goblins (legendary) and the Hammerfell gargoyles (a matter of public record) are, in point of fact, One And The Same. Why, a fool couldn't tell them apart, blindfolded."

Are we to defend our brothers and sisters in Greenshade from a distance? \n\nNo less damaging is the rumor that the Dominion has paid Altmer residents to move to Marbruk.

Wood Elves and Khajiit are included in this number as well and receive identical compensation.\n\nThe only payment the Dominion promises to those who will relocate to Marbruk is a spot in the land and housing lottery for the remaining available property. These are in limited quantities, but are given to ensure the thriving of the settlement, as required by trade and the defense of the region.\n\nIt bears repeating that it is the duty of loyal Dominion citizens to support their queen and their fellow races by joining in the defense of our common territory and shoring up the bonds of unity. Marbruk is only the latest city in the Dominion to symbolize those values. May it ever prosper!"

msgid "By Beredalmo the Signifier \n\nHeart of Valenwood, heart of the living forest, is too easily mistaken for an object, a single item, that can be claimed and manipulated. It is true that in the heart of the forest there is a magnificent tree, through which courses the metaphorical lifeblood of Valenwood. But to say that the tree is the heart is to vastly limit one's understanding of the Heart.\n\nIn truth, the Heart is more akin to the forest's soul. The magnificent tree is just the physical symbol of that soul, but like a soul in the body, the Heart is not in one place in the body, but suffused through the entire thing.\n\nStill, it's been apparent to anyone who wished to look that the ancient Ayleid site of Hectahame holds immense power, far outstripping the rest of Valenwood. As a consequence, that particular location is often referred to in older texts as the ""Heart of Valenwood"" and has become the target of numerous plots to harness that power for purposes both good and ill.\n\nOne of the earliest of these plots occurred while the Ayleids first came to Valenwood. A necromancer (his cursed name long lost to history) invaded Valenwood with an undead army, and perverted the life-giving power of the heart to raise up a formidable force of undead Ayleid spirits. The Ayleids fought a long and protracted battle to defeat the army, but in the end they were unable to defeat the army, only contain it.\n\nUsing welkynd stones, the Ayleids created powerful necromantic wards to seal off Hectahame, and the once great city became a prison for the army that had sought to conquer it. The undead were returned to the ground and trapped there. None who have attempted to break the wards have managed, and it is speculated that only an object that could cancel magic itself could undo the Ayleids' incredible handiwork.\n\nBut it is because of the powerful wards on Hectahame that the Heart of Valenwood is little understood and rarely spoken of. The Wood Elves view Hectahame with a mix of superstition and awe, fearing the ancient past and revering the life-giving power that seems to emanate from within.\n\nIt is said that the last Wood Elf to enter Hectahame and behold the heart was a Silvenar from over two hundred years ago. But even accounts from that time suggest that he was viewed as mad by his contemporaries."

I'll even share with you my tried-and-true secret for killing trolls.\n\nIntrigued? I hope so! Troll fat is a valuable commodity and there's fortune and glory to be made for the ambitious troll hunter.\n\nOnward, then!\n\nChapter I:\n\nI Just Saw A Troll!\n\nIf you think you've seen a troll, remain calm and slowly back away. The wise hunter knows that preparation is the key to success, and you certainly don't want to hunt any trolls unprepared!\n\nAh, but is it really a troll that you've spotted?\n\nThe first step in your hunt is the proper identification of your quarry. Trolls are roughly man-shaped, with lengthy, muscular arms that end in claw-tipped fingers. The creature's large mouth is filled with jagged teeth, all the better to crunch the bones of foolish hunters who didn't purchase my book. \n\nWithout a doubt, the troll's most distinctive and unusual feature is the third eye nestled in the center of its forehead.\n\nA troll's hide is covered in thick, shaggy fur. The coloration of this fur varies by region. Cave troll fur is brownish in color, while a frost or snow troll will have a white coat.\n\nChapter II:\n\nStop Healing Yourself\n\nSo, you've properly identified a troll and now you're stalking the beast, ready to strike. You're in for a challenging battle, but a profitable one, assuming you survive.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is that trolls are incredibly fast and strong for their size.  A troll likes to pummel its prey into submission with powerful arm strikes and claw attacks. For this reason, I strongly recommend a shield.\n\nIf you're brave enough—or foolish enough—to fight a troll without using a shield, then you'd better be an expert at parrying with whatever weapon you've got.\n\nTrolls also have the ability to rapidly heal from their wounds. As such, you do not want to get into a prolonged fight with one. Speed and aggression are the key to beating a troll, because there is no creature in Tamriel that can outlast one.\n\nOf course, speed and aggression will only take you so far against an angry troll. This is where my secret weapon comes in.\n\nChapter III:\n\nThe Secret Weapon\n\nFire, my friend. Say the word and commit it to memory, for fire is the troll-hunter's ultimate weapon.\n\nI cannot overstate the importance of fire in battling a troll.  Even trolls that don't dwell in cold climates are vulnerable to fire. If you're unable to use fire magic, carry a weapon enchanted with arcane flames.\n\nWhy is the troll vulnerable to fire? Rumor holds that the troll's regenerative abilities are less effective at healing burns. I don't really know the answer, but I can promise you this—fire works against trolls. This has been proven time and again.\n\nChapter IV:\n\nTrimming the Fat\n\nThe troll might be dead, but your job isn't finished just yet.\n\nLet the flames die down and then examine the troll's corpse. If you're lucky, you'll find some fat deposits that will fetch a good price in an apothecary's shop. In fact, if you've got a knack for alchemy yourself, you can boil the fat down for use in all manner of potions and tonics.\n\nIf you can find it, be sure to check the troll's den as well. Perhaps you'll find the remains of some foolish adventurer who was too cheap-minded to purchase this book.\n\nNo doubt you can put his coin to wiser use.\n\nNow you know everything that you need to make a living as a wealthy and reputable troll hunter. Go on, then! Get out there and find yourself some trolls!"

I swear, by Tava's red feathers, that it shall not be hurtful to you. It is quite harmless, this beetle. \n\nAt this size. \n\nFor it will grow—yes, even as you will grow, so will this beetle. As you grow and grow until you reach woman's height, so will this beetle grow and grow. \n\nAnd in the fullness of time, you will cease to grow. But the beetle will grow on. \n\nIt was not ever thus. In far-off Yokuda, in times of yore, when all walked in step with the gods, these beetles were the friends of our houses and the amusing companions of our children. They were named Samara Scarabs. And they grew, yes, but only to the size of an ample millet-loaf, for it was not needful for them to grow larger. For were they not favored of the children? Did they not scamper, and race, and sing the clickety-song? And were they not well-fed therefore, on seeds and savory dung-pellets?\n\nAye, it was so.\n\nAnd the lives of the people were good, for though the land was harsh, the people followed the will of the gods, and thus were vouchsafed enough to live well, and a little more. And the Divines were reverenced as it was written they should be, and all things were in their proper places. \n\nBut some there were among the people who decided that a little more than what they needed was not as much as they did want. And in their avarice they fell away from proper reverence, and were taken, yea, body and soul, with the Hunger of Sep. And this was an ill thing, for the Hunger of Sep can never be sated.\n\nThen evil came to Yokuda, and red war, and forbidden rites were practiced, and fell things were summoned that should never have been called forth. It was a Time of Ending. Satakal arose from the starry deeps, and Yokuda was pulled down beneath the waves. \n\nBut after every End Time comes a New Time, and it was even so in this case. For some of the people were permitted to sojourn to Tamriel, where we took Hammefell for our own. There we were given a chance to once again worship the gods in proper reverence. And we brought our Samara Scarabs with us, that we might delight the children and remember happier days.\n\nAnd the Hunger of Sep was left behind—for a time, my child, for a time. But it is deep in our mortal core, and may ever arise again. So the gods gave unto us a warning, yea, even unto the smallest children. For in this New Time, in this New Place, our little companions grew to the size of an ample millet-loaf, as was meet. However, they then continued to grow, and burgeon, and sprout hurtful claws and rending mandibles. And then, with tears, we drove them from our homes and into the wastes, where they flourished and became baneful. \n\nYes, my child—the Assassin Beetles that plague the empty places are our own Samara Scarabs, smitten by the gods with the Hunger of Sep.  They are a lesson to us, an awful warning to those who would become too avid. \n\nBe happy, then, and forego all avarice—for here we have enough to live well, and a little more."

msgid "A Walker's Guide to Happy Senche-Tigers\n\nby Azmu-ra\n\nThe mind of the senche-tiger is like its tail, weaving impossible shapes before pouncing on its prey. If you are that prey, too bad for you! But grab hold of the tail and the senche-tiger does exactly as you want, so long as your grip remains firm.\n\nIn theory one could lead a senche-tiger about by its tail forever, but Azmu-ra does not recommend it. Senches are quite fast, very strong, and entirely capable of holding a grudge! Much better to seize the mind, but how to do this?\n\nFirst understand that, like Khajiit, the senche-tigers have a powerful sweet tooth. They also have fine noses and will track moon-sugar down wherever it hides. In pockets, through walls, in the bellies of close friends—anywhere.\n\nFortunately, the senche-tiger's appetite for sugar is only so great. By keeping your senche-tiger on a steady diet, you can manage its more aggressive desires with more useful pursuits, like rat-catching. You need only know how much moon-sugar is enough moon-sugar.\n\nThis is where it gets tricky. The senche sweet tooth waxes and wanes with the moons, starting with the phase under which it was born and ending with its lunar opposites. Size is a factor, also, as larger senche require more moon-sugar!\n\nSome trainers can determine a senche-tiger's appetite for moon-sugar by consulting the local Two Moons, but Azmu-ra does not recommend this. A priestess is not always on hand, and keeping both the temple and your senche supplied with moon-sugar is an expensive proposition!\n\nAlso, senche-tigers grow swiftly. Unless fully grown, their appetites will change. Many would-be trainers have little time to regret a low stock of moon-sugar! The resulting carnage is never pretty.\n\nBetter to keep a stockpile of moon-sugar on hand. The senche eats until sated, and what is left can be used to ice the sweet roll, spice the pudding, or make delectable moon candy.\n\nOnce full of moon-sugar, a senche-tiger wants only two things: meat to fill its belly and a sunny place to bask. This makes them suited to guarding fields and hunting game, but this is about all they can do without years of training. Even then, training can only go so far.\n\nFor example, motivating senches to pull farming equipment is not recommended. If your senche-tiger should deign to endure the harness, it will still be inclined to chase anything larger than a field mouse that it spots across the fields. Save yourself the trouble of collecting scattered plows!\n\nWhile other trainers have had some success with watch-senche and battle-senche, Azmu-ra would strongly discourage training them to eat people unless you are strong and good at fighting. Even then, this one would not recommend it. A senche-tiger's loyalty reaches only so far as its belly, yes?\n\nHopefully this guide helped you avoid being eaten by your favorite senche-tiger. If not, well … Azmu-ra made no promises!"

msgid "by Cirantille\n\nWhile the insectoid creatures known as ""kwama"" originated in Morrowind, do not be surprised to find them elsewhere in Tamriel. The creatures have been transported, intentionally or otherwise, to many different parts of the world.\n\nThe barbarous Dunmer, for example, keep the creatures in ""egg mines"" because they find them a delicacy. ""Good eating!"" as one toothless old sot told me. I cannot imagine what passes for good food among the Dark Elves that they would eat insect eggs.\n\nBut the Dunmer may be on to something, in their own backward way. Kwama are, indeed, excellent miners. They prefer to live underground, creating elaborate tunnel systems as they build their warrens. The creatures consume organic material from the earth and appear to actually excrete minerals they cannot digest, such as gemstones, gold, and iron.\n\nAs an experiment, the Aldmeri Dominion is transporting kwama eggs to various outer territories. There, small kwama mines can be established. The kwama can dig to their hearts' content—if they have hearts—and our kwama keepers can pull the minerals from their refuse. Much more efficient than using Argonian captives. The bugs, at least, feed themselves.\n\nThere are several different kwama types within the species, and each must be dealt with in a different way.\n\nKwama scribs are the kwama young and are easily managed. They're voracious but strongly influenced by food. Scribs hatch from long eggs and grow from the size of a large man's foot to the length of a large dog. The scrib may evolve into one of the other types, or it may die.\n\nKwama foragers explore the outer mine areas and are known to search the surface of the world for new territory. Kwama keepers have learned to ""steer"" foragers toward potential mine sites and away from Dominion settlements, for kwama undermining can cause sinkholes. It is important for a kwama keeper to know when a forager can't be managed, as the forager must be dispatched before it can return to the mines.\n\nWorkers are the most useful of the kwama and will tirelessly dig away, expanding their warrens and searching for food. It is possible for a kwama keeper to use a goad to push workers toward or away from specific sites, but risky. Workers will fight back, and an uprising in a kwama mine is a violent and dangerous event.\n\nA few scribs grow up to become warriors. While some uneducated souls think that killing the warriors keeps the rest in line, this expert disagrees. Killing the warriors causes more scribs to evolve into the mine's protectors and soon you have nothing but the violent creatures to deal with! What's more, the warriors can command lesser kwama, which means an uprising is almost certain. If a warrior must be killed, do it quickly, and away from the rest of the nest!\n\nFinally, the kwama queen. She is a huge, bloated creature, nearly immobile and very rare. Not all hives have queens. Many are just offshoots of greater hives. But all eggs are born of a kwama queen. If one encounters a queen, move away quickly! They are not pleasant creatures and cannot be influenced. Every kwama in a hive will throw itself at a perceived ""invader"" to protect the majestic corpulence of their queen."

The Reman Empire built this fortress into the side of a mountain so as to have an impregnable base, from whence columns of legionaries could be sent out to patrol the borders. The location offered elevation and good source of stone to build the walls of the outside fortress. The result was a large bastion with defensive walls, towers, and a subterranean series of halls, rooms, and dungeons built into the bowels of the mountain. It is said that the legionaries outfitted their fortress with many traps of cunning and clever design, to defend themselves should the walls ever be breached. \n\nFort Sphinxmoth was abandoned by the Legions after the fall of the Second Empire, then was traded back and forth for a generation between warring Bosmeri and Khajiiti tribes, suffering additional damage every time it changed hands. Finally a landslide destroyed much of the upper works, and the fort was vacated by both sides. Word of mouth says that nothing worth looting was left in Fort Sphinxmoth, and today it's no more than an overgrown ruin that's been bypassed by history."

Peek into a den of sticks or the shallow cave of a rocky hillock, and you may not meet a troll or a wolf but a small community of these primitive creatures. Often it is best to leave their hunting land fallow, as they tend to shy away from our thresholds and keep other marauders in check. If an ogre is presenting you with some difficulty, you are obliged to contact the nearest town guard. For a nominal fee, a raiding party can easily dispatch such a foe.\n\nOgres have not the intelligence to argue a point and take a primal enjoyment when mashing den intruders into malformed corpses. They hunt for food and gather necessities, and enjoy life on Nirn no more than that, with the exception of when employing their considerable strength to wrench apart foes or lob large rocks at them. Fortunately, the ogres' ponderous nature enables nimble opponents to avoid such attacks. As for their coloration, Phrastus of Elinhir's speculation that their gray-blue skin camouflages their silhouetted forms against the sky has been convincingly debunked by Lady Cinnabar of Taneth, so we are no closer to solving that riddle: one cannot simply walk up to an ogre and ask."

Although, Imperial Scout Tutor Acilius describes the swampland as ""a soup of suffering, disease, where a drop of ingested ground water can set off a torrent in the bowels."" However, the city of Helstrom in the impenetrable interior has never been approached with a siege in mind, the empire content to incorporate the northern and western borderland regions. Indeed, it was these coastal tracts, where Tamriel's delinquents once freely roamed, that were changed into barely habitable prison settlements. It is not surprising, then, that a separate but comparable history of indenture exists elsewhere in this great morass: Stormhold.\n\nFounded by the Barsaebic Ayleids before parchment records were kept, Stormhold holds the infamous history of the Dark Elf. Primal wealth is still evident on the intricate stonework of the Ayleid ruins, and the more recent Dunmeri stone structures show what venomous and uncaring rule can build. Abutting these monuments to greed and cruelty are the more modest mud huts of the Argonian contingent, once the homes of the collaborators—who worked with the Dunmer to raze primitive villages and gather suitable captives for plantation work across Morrowind—and now home to the reptilian race only now finding their way out of the mire of oppression.\n\nAs thuggery encroached on Stormhold during the upheavals of the Second Era, and the dark Dunmeri chains of bondage—as well as irregular Imperial warlords driven to distraction with thoughts of bounty and easily exploitable labor—threatened to wipe every last tribe of Argonians from the province, there was little the exploited reptilians could do. Until, that is, the rise of the Argonian vicecanons, who seem to fulfill the administrative functions that councilors and tribal leaders do in other realms."

Look closer, in case these are effigies to animal gods, worshiped by Ysgramor's primitives. The deification of the bear, Dragon, fox, moth, owl, snake, whale, and wolf have all been recorded by our field agents, and many believe these totems stand as sentinels over lost ruins. These tumbledown temples, guarded by half-woken draugr and worse, are from a time when the Dragon Cult supposedly ruled this province. \n\nWhile no modern Tamrielan need believe these hopelessly fanciful fables, the Nords' simple-minded veneration for these places betokens their fear of the return of the Dragon Priests. During the worship of Akatosh (the Dragon) as god-kings over men, these priests were the conduit through which Dragons spoke, made laws, and were honored with grand and elaborate temples. When Alduin, Akatosh's firstborn, was defeated atop the Throat of the World during the mythical Dragon War, the cult that sprang up around these Dragon guardians soon receded into the soil, buried among Dragon mounds with the remains of these beasts. They were finally vanquished in the Rift mountains by High King Harald in 1E 140. The veneration of animal gods was soon replaced by the Eight Divines."

Although hide stretched and tied over frames of bone may appear temporary, they are usually cocooned within sacred tree hollows and range dramatically in size. Wander the rivers and coast, where traders can provide quality imported lumber without breaking the Green Pact, and you will find more traditional wooden abodes.\n\nJourney deeper into the forests if you dare, and you may stumble across the city of Elden Root or Silvenar. Both have dwellings on the forest floor (typically built by other races, usually the Altmer), but many homes are both concealed and cradled within the canopy of graht-oak trees. Citified tree-folk favor a life among the branches and have woven them together to form limbed pathways, without contravening the law of the land. Trails of thick, living vines anchor dozens of platforms that carry goods and people among the graht-oak. These platforms are hoisted by strong, often foreign laborers.\n\nBone, resin, and sinew are employed in Bosmeri bridge design. A secondary market in such scraps allows the tree-dweller to tip their animal waste from above to the ground below, where it is scavenged and reworked into a variety of items—certainly better than the refuse-strewn thoroughfares of Skyrim. As the moons rise, additional light is provided by luminous lichen, molds, and fungal growths living at the perpetually shadowed base of the oaks. Higher up, nocturnal flowers feed from the graht-oak, attracting torchbugs, whose hives light the branch platforms without the aid of fire. Adaptation to overcome self-imposed and crippling shortcomings has allowed the Wood Elf to survive, even thrive, despite their rigorous restrictions."

Naturally, the obtuse Elves (and other admirers of this seeping pustule on the buttocks of Tamriel) favor the name Argonia, an ancient battleground where their forebears were put to death. Perhaps because of this, it was deemed appropriate to give the primordial tribes of lizard-folk the name ""Argonian"" in our common tongue. What cannot be argued is the pitiful state of this province; it positively oozes with the devastated and fetid: the scars of battles past and plunderers present permanently disfigure these already-inhospitable borderlands. Wade inward, though, and the dark heart of Black Marsh will elude you; its elements combine to infect explorers with poxes both real and imagined.\n\nThe inhabitants of this province enjoy an anonymity not seen elsewhere.

But hasten not to categorize these as you would a Khajiiti Skooma fiend; these tree-folk are vicious, adept at banditry, and worthy of your concern and attention, if not your respect.\n\nThe Bosmeri race is governed—if one can describe this loose hegemony as such—by the Royal Camoran Dynasty, but there seems little rigidity or exertion of jurisdiction among the disorganized tribes of the Bosmer. Only slightly more stringent are the clan lines, which are matrilineal in nature. Ruled by the Treethane, or head tribesman, these serve little purpose other than providing protection during times of war. The real power is wielded by the priests of the forest deity Y'ffre, known as Spinners, who enforce the Green Pact, a bizarre code of conduct forcing the Bosmer to feed carnivorously and never use living vegetation of any kind, for any means.\n\nThese are no woodland nymphs. Wood Elves go to war not to conquer lands or covet precious resources; they do it for sport. Unless a threat to Valenwood presents itself, Bosmer consider the slaying of others to be simply unnecessary, and wagers are even made prior to raids regarding the theft of prized possessions without a drop of blood spilled. But when called upon, they excel at the bow. Youngsters are trained to a formidable degree to snipe using both range and speed to their advantage.

Their curved gables and strong, pointed steeples emphasize height, with ceilings a giant would have trouble scraping his head on and rooftops stretching proudly up toward the firmament. Their structures provide a visual echo to the ""High Elves'"" appearance, as they try to contrast their structures with the abodes of other races.\n\nThe more perceptive of historians (such as Cantaber Congonius of Skingrad) have discerned clear similarities when comparing settlements of the Altmeri and Ayleid, unmistakably because they share the same ancestors. Where the Ayleids departed Summerset Isle, the Altmer remained; yet their structures share many common elements. One only need walk the ruins near Bravil, then compare paintings of Skywatch for corroboration. Subtle changes are less obvious: while the Altmer are snobbish, they never sank to Ayleid levels of perniciousness, and the more refined buildings of Auridon reflect this.\n\nSuch structural designs stem from ancient roots, using methods tried and tested, but not to the point of becoming obsolete. The Altmer seek refinement rather than innovation, and they are conceitedly resistant to large-scale changes but are content to tinker. The results reveal highly sophisticated precision, harmony, and the selection and repetition of orthodox compositions."

msgid "The Revolting Life Cycle of the Land Dreugh (Abridged) \n\nField Notes by Fronto Maecilius\n\nContrary to local myths about the origins of this base species, the dreugh migrate from the Abecean Sea into the lakes and inlets that feed into the Iliac Bay. In addition to their mass of clawlike limbs, pincers, and scuttling feet protruding from a human-torso-sized skeletal frame, the dreugh wear armored hides and secrete shell wax that are prized in some quarters. They are aquatic scavengers, spending much of their time in deep ocean water. Local fishermen tell of altercations with this species (such as when the dreugh cut fishermen's nets to steal fish), but dreugh are mostly mild-mannered, except during karvinasim, their period of transformation.\n\nDuring karvinasim, dreugh walk upon the land, favoring shoreline marshes and rivers close to the open water. Hatchlings are closely guarded, and broodmothers are extremely territorial, reacting to invaders with both speed and hostility. This leads credence to the notion that karvinasim heightens the dreugh's martial instincts: Indeed, after witnessing the evisceration of our lead geographer Pulcherius Pomptinus, our raiding party thought twice before capturing and culling further specimens.\n\nAfter a year of land walking, the dreugh return to the water. As they submerge, they undergo a final transformation known as ""meff,"" where they devour their land skin and air organs—the body parts they no longer need—and then vomit the congealed remains as small fibrous balls that are approximately a foot in diameter. These disgusting and foul-smelling spheres are known as ""grom"" and are found in clusters around lakes. So far, our apothecaries have discovered no virtues in grom, aside from inducing queasiness in some of the more weak-stomached members of this contingent."

msgid "by Wafimeles Masteret (Lorekeeper)\n\nOne of the dozen or so known Wyrd covens scattered across Tamriel, the Beldama Wyrd is of especial interest to Imperial researchers. The Beldama are found within the thick forests of central Glenumbra, which are problematic to the explorer due to the broken terrain and heavy vegetation. Precious few have encountered the Beldama Wyresses (another name for a group of ward-sisters, or witches), but those who have speak of dark encampments under the canopy of ancient oak trees and cavorting rituals to honor Jephre, an aspect of Y'ffre, the most venerated god of the Bosmeri deities.\n\nThe all-female Beldama Wyrd trace their origin to the time Y'ffre transformed himself into the first Ehlnofey (or ""Earth Bones"") and established the laws of nature. While this is obviously mere myth, the Beldama Wyrd all fiercely believe they are descendants of the Ehlnofey. It is uncertain whether the Wyresses should be considered beneficial or malefic, but all agree they are uncanny and forceful: They see themselves as wardens of the forests with an unwavering reverence for nature. Most Bretons consider them dangerous witches, to be placated rather than revered. It is no wonder, then, that the Beldama Wyrd dwells in the least populated region of High Rock.\n\nThe Beldama tend to congregate around a mysterious and reputedly gigantic Wyrd Tree, which glows with an unnatural light and looks unlike any other tree in the northern forests of Tamriel. Should the Empire consider an invasion, threats of deforestation might be a way to cow the local population, although the Beldama Wyrd may have unknown magic capable of forestalling incursions."

Their chitin is prized by alchemists of certain schools (though I would never use it), and their meat has been regarded as a delicacy in some parts of Tamriel, particularly Morrowind. \n\nBy their nature, they seek to defend their rivers, streams, and beaches from what they seem to think is a threat to their territory. They tend to cluster in groups and attack any that come by, fearless, with an overblown sense of their combat prowess. Nothing could turn away the ire of the common mudcrab save for a well-placed strike of an arrow or axe. \n\nIn my time studying the specimens on the shore of the Bjoulsae, I've noticed an odd tendency in recent months. Where normally, I must tread carefully to avoid their notice lest I am forced to kill the subject, recently, I've been able to make close observations, even so far as to pet the carapace without them reacting. \n\nLast week, I sat in the middle of a clutch, unmolested, fervently noting all the details I tend to miss in more distant studies. However, they are not completely docile. They will respond if directly provoked. I observed as a bear tried to pry one open, and a whole clutch came to the defense of their kin, forcing the bear to flee. \n\nI am positive that they notice me. It's not just ignorance. One even came over and ran his feelers over on my hands, as if he were studying me! What has changed? Is it a breeding season? Could there be something in the water affecting their behavior? Could the troubled times be affecting them? I will continue my observations to find out more."

His feet slowed, pounding deep footprints in the earth. He no longer spoke; he sighed. He whispered.\n\n""'We are who we are,' the taller tribe says, in a voice made of leaf-shivers.

Both incidents have fostered interest in the Island over the years by researchers and academics, though none could find a cause for the storms.\n\nFor all the scholars can tell, Tempest Island simply sits in a swath of sea that's prone to extreme weather—nothing more nor less."

They see themselves as eternal outsiders and invaders, and even when they conquer and rule another people, they feel no kinship with them.\n \nThe breath and the voice are the vital essence of a Nord. When they defeat great enemies they take their tongues as trophies. These are woven into ropes and can hold speech like an enchantment. The power of a Nord can be articulated into a shout, like the kiai of an Akaviri swordsman. The strongest of their warriors are called ""Tongues."" When the Nords attack a city, they take no siege engines or cavalry; the Tongues form in a wedge in front of the gatehouse, and draw in breath. When the leader lets it out in a kiai, the doors are blown in, and the axemen rush into the city. Shouts can be used to sharpen blades or to strike enemies. A common effect is the shout that knocks an enemy back, or the power of command. A strong Nord can instill bravery in men with his battle-cry, or stop a charging warrior with a roar. The greatest of the Nords can call to specific people over hundreds of miles, and can move by casting a shout, appearing where it lands.\n \nThe most powerful Nords cannot speak without causing destruction. They must go gagged, and communicate through a sign language and through scribing runes.\n \nThe further north you go into Skyrim, the more powerful and elemental the people become, and the less they require dwellings and shelters. Wind is fundamental to Skyrim and the Nords; those that live in the far wastes always carry a wind with them."
