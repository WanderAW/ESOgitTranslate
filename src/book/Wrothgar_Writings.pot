msgid "Few legends among the Orsimer inspire more respect and fear than the legend of the great Thukhozod. This great and powerful necromancer has been around for generations, apparently ageless and undying. Of course, for every story where an Orc has seen or interacted with the great Thukhozod, there are five more who claim to have explored his lair and seen no sign of the mysterious figure.\n\nWhatever the truth of the legendary necromancer, multiple tales talk about the unique bracer he wears upon his left arm. While not magical, it is said to be beautiful and striking. It would make a great addition to the exhibits in the House of Orsimer Glories."

msgid "By Zephrine Frey, Chronicler of Wayrest\n\nI first met Kurog gro-Bagrakh in the wilds of Elsweyr. I was there pretending to be a scholar from Wayrest, but my true purpose was to watch, listen, and report back to King Emeric of Wayrest about events in the Khajiiti homeland. It was in this capacity as a spy that I originally encountered the boisterous and charismatic Orc warrior. He was newly arrived from Wrothgar, busy establishing himself in the mercenary group known as Gaspard's Stalkers. From all reports, he was brave, competent, and of unmatched physical prowess. He certainly looked the part to me.\n\nThe Breton mercenary leader, Gaspard Esmery, opened his ranks to any and all races. As long as you were willing to follow orders and fight with all your strength, Gaspard had a place for you in his unit. Kurog brought along a handful of powerful Orcs who also happened to be extremely loyal to the young warrior. Soon, they were the most-prominent members of the Stalkers, getting the most-dangerous missions and the ogre's share of the loot.\n\nI was able to get close to Kurog on a number of occasions. He enjoyed being flirted with, especially by an attentive Breton woman who enjoyed sampling Khajiiti delicacies as much as he did. During these moments when we met for food and drink, he let down his guard and told me things I'm sure he wouldn't have revealed to any of his male acquaintances. It was during one such rendezvous, in a dark and seedy tavern in the city of Orcrest, that I learned about the Orc warrior's past and his dreams for the future. \n\nWe have all heard the horrible stories of life in the Orc strongholds. Kurog told me of his younger days as part of a clan in distant Wrothgar. He was the best and the brightest of a new crop of younglings—stronger, faster, and in many ways more brilliant than either his contemporaries or most of his elders. But he was unsatisfied with life in the clan. He wanted to prove himself in battle. He wanted to see the world. And both he and his clan chief knew that if he remained in the stronghold much longer, one of them was going to die. That was the way of life for the Orcs.\n\nInstead of pushing the issue and challenging the chief, Kurog rallied his bosom companions and signed on with a recruiter for Gaspard's Stalkers mercenary company. After lending his talents to help win skirmishes across Hammerfell and Cyrodiil, the company had made its way to Elsweyr. Kurog seemed to be having a grand old time seeing the sights, eating the food, bedding the wenches (his words, not mine), and winning battle after battle. I offered Kurog a spoonful of honey pudding, my other hand resting on his powerful arm, and asked in all innocence, ""But what about the future, my powerful friend?""\n\n""The future?"" Kurog laughed. ""I'm going to go home, kill the old chief, and take command of my clan!""\n\nKurog said all this matter-of-factly. He wasn't boasting. He wasn't trying to impress me. He was simply telling me what he believed. And you know what? I believed it, too. This was definitely an Orc that King Emeric was going to want to keep an eye on, mark my words."

msgid "The history of the Order of the Silver Dawn stretches back to our founding in 2E 428 during the werewolf crisis that plagued High Rock and was known as the Curse of the Crimson Moon. Adeliza Silver-Axe established the order after her beloved son, Jaron, was inflicted with the beast-curse. She was forced to kill her own son to save her village. To honor his memory and to provide a rallying point for the order, Adeliza wove the banner that would forever represent us with thread and wool and tears. She also added a few drops of her own blood to show her commitment to the cause. Every commander of the order since has added a drop of his or her blood to the banner to carry on the tradition.\n\nIn time, Adeliza grew the order into a powerful force. She led the order to Wrothgar, where she founded the base of operations that we call home to this day. The Argent Mine, once a rich silver mine that made Adeliza's family wealthy beyond compare, was turned into the secret base of the Order of the Silver Dawn. We still mine silver from its depths to craft our weapons and armor, and our sacred banner has a place of honor in the Purifier's Hall.\n\nMy term as commander of the order, which began a scant six years ago, has been plagued by one particular werewolf and his feral followers. Magnar Child-Eater has gathered a pack of werewolves to his side. Together, they rampage throughout Wrothgar and High Rock, causing mayhem, raiding and marauding, and seeking new converts to their terrible, bestial tribe.\n\nMagnar Child-Eater, in particular, deserves a prison in the foulest corner of dread Oblivion. His name isn't simply to scare the common folk. He actually has a taste for the tender flesh of children, and he often rewards his pack hunters for acquiring such delicacies for him to feast upon. I am not exaggerating by saying that the Silver Dawn is at war with the Magnar Pack. Casualties have mounted on both sides, but I have hopes that our scouts are close to discovering the pack's lair. Then we can launch a final assault and destroy Magnar and his feral offspring once and for all."

We knew we couldn't take on three of the beasts with any certainty of victory, so we decided to hide and wait for them to pass. But Urgon, clumsy skeever that he is, dropped his axe. That's when we decided down was a better direction to run than up.\n\nBrokuhk thought our best option was to make it back to the caves we passed through. Even though there were ogres living in the caves, he said we'd be able to find a corner to hide in. Probably would have worked, too, if we hadn't lost most of our supplies escaping from the shrine. And if we hadn't run out of fuel for our fire.\n\nAt least we have the rubbing. If Kharsthun makes it this far, he'll know that the shrine isn't that far away."

Thukhozod isn't one, he's many, and I am just the latest in a long line of powerful necromancers.\n\nThe first Thukhozod was the original Thukhozod, an Orc necromancer with a plan and a dream.

But I don't believe what happened next was his idea.

In that way, Thukhozod continued and his march toward immortality was on.\n\nThe list of Orcs, each and every one an ancestor of mine, goes on for pages and is stored in a hidden vault deep within this sanctum.

msgid "By Zephrine Frey, Chronicler of Wayrest\n\nNow I want to take a few pages to record King Kurog's grand vision for Wrothgar and the Orc nation. I listened to his plan develop over the years from a nebulous dream, to a kernel of an idea, to the strategy that now inspires the re-building of Orsinium. \n\nDuring one of our first rendezvous, Kurog imbibed an astonishing amount of moon-sugar double rum. This had the effect of making him both introspective and extremely talkative. With a few smiles, a well-placed giggle, and an occasional compliment or question, I was able to get Kurog to open up about a great many things. But as the evening wore on, he began to tell me about his dream for the Orsimer—his name for the people we call Orcs. \n\n""The strongholds,"" Kurog said. ""They've served the Orsimer well for generations. But our traditions, for all they aid and guide us, they also hold us back. They mire us in outdated notions and meaningless restrictions."" There was more, of course. While he understood the need for violence and was extremely good at it, he hated that everything in the strongholds was solved by beating or killing someone or another. ""It makes it very hard to have a civil discourse on anything of substance,"" he bemoaned, ""because sooner or later someone reaches for something heavy or sharp to use to punctuate their particular point of view. Something needs to change.""\n\nThe next time the subject came up, we were drinking treacle tea and watching the sun set over the Tenmar Forest. It was obvious that Kurog had given the topic much thought since we had last discussed it. In addition to just making life better for the Orsimer, now he also wanted to elevate his people on the political level as well. ""The other kingdoms will never take us seriously as long as we remain trapped in our old traditions,"" he said, a trace of bitterness evident in his voice. ""We must develop a modern society if we are ever to stand shoulder to shoulder with the other races as equals. We need to build Orsimer towns and cities that can sustain diplomacy and trade while not looking like ancient and restrictive fortresses. A little fear in your contemporaries is all well and good. I find that it helps immensely in negotiations. But attitudes and mannerisms that invoke terror? Those should be locked away and reserved for your enemies, not left on constant display to frighten friends and foes alike.""\n\nIt was my final day in Elsweyr. I was preparing to return to Wayrest after what I assumed was going to be my last extended stay in the Khajiiti countryside, when Kurog invited me to join him for dinner. He had reserved a private room at the local inn and paid the establishment's chef to prepare a farewell feast for the two of us to share. As we munched on dried sugarmeat and caramelized sweetcakes, Kurog picked up his ongoing narrative of how he was going to return home and help his people. ""I plan to rebuild our past glory, perhaps by reestablishing Yashnag's ancient Orsimer kingdom in Falkreath or maybe even raising the ruins of Orsinium itself.""\n\nKurog's dream had become goal, a challenge he had placed upon himself to test his mettle and his strength of spirit. It would begin with Kurog's return to Wrothgar to wrest the chiefdom of his clan from the ""insolent leader who wasn't fit to shine a young Orc's tusks"" (his words, not mine). Then he would gather other clan leaders to his banner, forming a nation of independent states that was large enough and powerful enough to carve a kingdom for the Orcs—a kingdom that would see Kurog as its king. ""Tell Emeric that the next time we meet, it will be as equals or it will be as enemies!"" Kurog said. ""Under my rule, Orsimer will have every right and opportunity afforded to the citizens of Wayrest or Windhelm. The old ways will fall away, and a new age will dawn for the Orsimer people. This I so pledge!""\n\nI won't deny it. Kurog's words, his passion, they moved me. I wanted to believe that he would succeed, that the Orcs would rise up and prosper under his benign rule. I would never forget what he described to me. Later, when King Emeric was in desperate need of allies, I would remember Kurog and whisper into Emeric's ear. And that is how alliances are born."

msgid "By Zephrine Frey, Chronicler of Wayrest\n\nLet's talk about the wives of King Kurog of Wrothgar. He began collecting wives shortly after he returned to Wrothgar and defeated Bolazgar to become chief of his clan. His first selections were purely political, taking wives to shore up his alliances with other clans. It was about this time that I became aware of Kurog's mother, Alga. He had mentioned her a few times in conversations we had over the years, but she never seemed to be a major influence in his life. At least, she wasn't prominent in his life as a mercenary.\n\nNow that Kurog was chief of his clan, his mother had stepped in to fill a need he never knew he had. She took the title of Grand Forge-Mother and immediately set out to negotiate marriages for her son. For those of you not intimately familiar with Orc traditions, you must understand that the only male in a clan allowed to take wives is the chief. He functions sort of like the primary male in a pride of lions, lording over all until someone younger and stronger comes along to take his crown. Just as Kurog did with Bolazgar. The chief's wives become the highest-ranking people in the stronghold, taking charge of important clan functions while the chief supervises everything from a distance. The only activity the chief personally takes charge of is war, whether leading raids or actually taking his clan into battle against a hated enemy.\n\nThe most-influential and powerful of the chief's wives is the hunt-wife, and this was the first marriage that Alga worked to secure. Rumors abound that more than a dozen young hopefuls were vying for the position, but Alga and Kurog had a specific goal in mind. In the end, a powerful daughter from the Shatul clan, famed hunters of the Wrothgar highlands, was selected to solidify the alliance between the clans. Noroga pledged her loyalty, taking her place as Kurog's hunt-wife.\n\nWhen it came time to find Kurog a forge-wife to oversee blacksmithing and mining for the clan, Alga looked no further than the famed weapon and armor smiths of the Morkul clan. The obvious choice was the Morkul chief's eldest daughter, an Orc maiden named Ashaka. But Alga was more interested in the younger Tugha, who had traveled abroad for two years to study with the blacksmiths of western Skyrim. Her experiences, modern attitudes, and obvious intelligence won her the position of forge-wife for Kurog and his clan.\n\nIf there was a requirement other than bringing another powerful clan under Kurog's banner, the role of hearth-wife demanded not only a brilliant household administrator but a talent for cooking that went beyond the usual skills of a mountain-bear hash-slinger. Kurog, as I've mentioned in previous volumes of this chronicle, relished food with a passion. Between fighting and eating, I'd be hard-pressed to determine which activity Kurog enjoyed more. Be that as it may, it would take years to find someone of Orcish grace and exceptional talent to fill this marital role. A great competition was eventually staged while Kurog was off aiding King Emeric at the end of Ranser's War. \n\nWhile Kurog was away, at least according to my sources, Forge-Mother Alga invited the most eligible Orc maidens from the most powerful clans not yet allied with Kurog to compete for the title of hearth-wife. She made them engage in a culinary battle that was as violent and bloody as any skirmish Kurog himself had ever undertaken. The women had to track, kill, and clean their own ingredients. They had to fight each other to secure spices from distant lands. And then they had to present their finished meals before time ran out. Alga and Kurog's first wives, Noroga and Tugha, would judge the worth of each contestant's offering. Barazal of Clan Murtag won the day, as much for her physical strength (it is said she killed a mountain bear with her bare hands) as her deft use of delicate spices. \n\nKurog has many and varied lesser wives, most of who I have no real knowledge of, as they work behind the scenes and rarely made their presence known. Two, however, are always at Kurog's side. These are his protectors, the shield-wives. Two powerful fighters currently fill these roles in Kurog's household, the warrior-sisters Oshgatha and Razbela. The sisters are as loyal to each other as they are to the king, ready to lay down their lives to defend him should the need arise. Even Noroga and Tugha remain on best behavior when the shield-wives are present.\n\nNote: Though each marriage secured Kurog a certain degree of cooperation from the various clans, I should point out that since Kurog took the title of king, some of the clan chiefs who joined with Kurog by virtue of his marriage to their daughters have had a change of heart. While these chiefs won't openly oppose Kurog due to the marriage alliance, they have yet to publicly accept him as king of the Orcs. This, as you can probably guess, makes Kurog extremely unhappy."

msgid "By Zephrine Frey, Chronicler of Wayrest\n\nAs the years went by, I was often used as an intermediary between King Emeric and Chief Kurog. Because of this, and due to my ongoing friendship with the chief, I was privy to many of the most significant events in Kurog's life. And not only to the events, but also to Kurog's thoughts and feelings, because he continued to trust me and utilize me as a confidant, even writing to me when we were in different parts of the continent. (But, sadly, no. I never took him up on his offer to become one of his wives. Kurog began to collect wives early in his chiefdom, not unlike a stable master collects horses. But that's a tale for another day.)\n\nKurog spent a few years consolidating his power, growing his clan and forming alliances with clan chiefs that were willing to support his goals and ideals. It was about this time that Kurog revealed the details of his grand vision. ""I will follow in the footsteps of mighty Yashnag and march into Skyrim,"" he wrote to me. ""I will restore the Orcish kingdom in Falkreath and create an Orcish city to rival the wondrous Wayrest."" While Kurog was busy to the north, King Emeric was dealing with issues in central High Rock. King Ranser of Shornhelm had declared war against Wayrest. After a clandestine meeting with the king, I decided I had to make one more trip to stand at Kurog's side.\n\nI caught up with Kurog near Dragonstar, as his forces were accumulating in the mountains of western Skyrim. They were having a more difficult time of it than Kurog had anticipated. The Nords, wracked as they were by civil war, nonetheless proved to be capable and courageous fighters. The path to Falkreath was long and arduous, and the rock and snow were going to be bathed in the blood of warriors from both sides before this campaign was done. I sat with Kurog one night, watching the roaring fire, when the clan chief opened up as he did during our times together back in Elsweyr.\n\n""These damn Nords,"" Kurog said, ""if they had a shred of decency they'd put down their weapons and get out of our way. But no. The clans that aren't fighting us are trying to bribe us to aid their cause. They don't see us as conquerors. They think we're mercenaries! I'm beginning to think that my Falkreath dream is going to be crushed by all this snow and ice. Damn the Nords and damn their foul mead!""\n\nI placed a hand on Kurog's knee and said softly, ""What if I offered you a different, better dream? And the authority to make that dream a reality?"" Kurog looked at me for a long time. Then he stood, towering over me, and demanded to know what I was talking about. Instead, I reached into my traveling cloak, withdrew a leather document pouch, and handed it to him. He read the contents by the light of the fire. Read it again. And a third time. Then he asked me if this was some sort of trick. I assured him that it wasn't a trick. It was an offer. ""You help King Emeric, and King Emeric helps you,"" I said, and the two of us talked long into the deepening night.\n\nIn the morning, Kurog had a list of demands for me to take back to Wayrest. I was impressed. He was driving a hard bargain, but he was also offering King Emeric the power necessary to end Ranser's War in one fell stroke. I told him I would get the documents to King Emeric as quickly as possible. In return, he promised that his army would be ready and waiting for Emeric's signal—but they would not make a move until the signed documents were in Kurog's hands.\n\nAnd that was how the Orcs joined the Daggerfall Covenant and Kurog became the King of Wrothgar."

If anything, his mood grew even lighter the closer we got to the land of his birth. Along the way, we talked of many things, including Kurog's hopes to change some of the more oppressive and restrictive traditions of his people. ""We should build great cities, cosmopolitan communities with places of learning and culture,"" Kurog said. ""And cuisine. Lots and lots of cuisine. It's so much better than food.""\n\nWhen we finally crossed the border into Wrothgar, the mood among Kurog's company of Orcs turned somber and more serious. They knew the stakes of siding with Kurog against their clan chief and were prepared to deal with those consequences, but that didn't make marching toward possible doom any easier. Kurog, on the other hand, maintained a jovial, even childlike, glee. He had prepared for this moment his entire life, and he was ready to leap head-first into his destiny. I was afraid for him, but I was also honored to call him my friend. And, if I may be so bold, just watching Kurog riding tall and proud atop his horse made my heart beat a little faster. I guess I was a bit smitten with the charismatic Orc warrior.\n\nAt some point Kurog must have noticed that I was staring at him. He gave me a dazzling Orc smile, winked, and said, ""Once I become chief, you could be one of my wives. Consider that an open invitation."" I turned away, hoping he didn't see how flush my face had become. I didn't know if I should laugh or scream in angry mortification at such a ludicrous idea. But by the time I gathered my thoughts and turned back to confront him, Kurog was holding up one gauntleted hand. ""From here,"" he said, ""I go on alone.""\n\nChief Bolazgar waited for Kurog. Four large, hulking Orc warriors stood beside the chief, their angry gazes locked on the younger Orc. And beyond them, it seemed to me like the entire clan had come out to see what was about to occur. ""Are you going to grovel before your chief and beg my forgiveness, Kurog?"" Bolazgar sneered. ""No, not today,"" Kurog replied cheerfully. ""Today, I challenge you for leadership of the clan.""\n\nEven from a distance, I could see that Chief Bolazgar was shaking with rage. ""How dare you?"" he bellowed. ""Do you think you can best me in fair combat? Do you?""\n\nKurog shrugged. ""As a matter of fact, I know I can best you. You've grown fat and weak while I've been fighting wars in distant lands,"" Kurog proclaimed. ""In fact, I'm not sure there's going to be anything fair about this combat.""\n\nWith a scream of pure hatred, Bolazgar drew his weapon and charged. In stark contrast, Kurog calmly unsheathed his sword and stood his ground. Then, with an economy of motion, he blocked the clan chief's initial, clumsy attack, and followed that with a single, devastating swipe. Bolazgar's head bounced three times before it came to rest against the boot of one of his honor guards.\n\nThe field was silent for a long moment. Then the first call went out, ""Long live Chief Kurog."" The rest of the clan took up the chant as each member, in turn, dropped to one knee before the powerful Kurog. He smiled. ""Today begins a new day for the Orsimer!"" Kurog proclaimed. ""I will lead you to glory! On this, you have my word!""\n\nAnd it was clear that I wasn't the only one who believed him."

They had recently resigned their commissions in Gaspard's Stalkers mercenary company and were making their way back to the wilds of Wrothgar. Thanks to the friendship I had fostered with Kurog during our time together in Elsweyr, he contacted me in the hope of visiting with me when they arrived in Wayrest. I readily agreed and offered to play tour guide while he was in the city.\n\nAfter spending a few days showing Kurog around the city and introducing him to the many tastes of Breton society (Kurog certainly does love to eat!), I surprised him with a clandestine visit to Wayrest Castle. I must admit that I was slightly worried about how the meeting was going to turn out. Kurog can be loud and crass, and he knows very little of the social graces. In retrospect, I shouldn't have been concerned. King Emeric and Kurog got along smashingly! They seemed to share similar opinions about politics and warfare, and they took great pleasure in trying to make the other laugh out loud. At the end of the evening, Kurog admitted to the king that he was returning to Wrothgar to claim his rightful place as chief of his clan.\n\n""Should I be worried?"" King Emeric asked with a smile. \n\n""Of course you should be worried,"" Kurog laughed. ""But I like you, King Emeric. I think I will seek to rebuild Yashnag's kingdom in Falkreath before I turn my attention toward High Rock.""\n\nThe two men shook hands and a shiver ran down my spine. I had a feeling that I was witnessing something important, even if I never imagined just how monumental this moment would actually prove to be. As Kurog started to take his leave, King Emeric had one more surprise to add to the evening's already long list of amazing occurrences. ""My friend,"" Emeric said, ""I have a request. Allow Lady Zephrine to accompany you back to Wrothgar. She has been my eyes and ears in distant lands, and I certainly want to know how your ambitions play out.""\n\nKurog laughed again. It was an infectious sound. ""You want me to take your spy to Wrothgar?"" Again, Kurog demonstrated he wasn't quite as thick-headed as most people believed about Orcs. I wonder how long ago he guessed as to my true nature. ""Damn it all, why not? She's amusing, she knows how to eat and drink, and she's more than pleasant to look at. Pack your bags, my lady. And bring something warm. The weather in Wrothgar can be a bit nippy.""\n\nAnd with that, I accompanied Kurog to the land of the Orcs."

If you would be so kind, the next time you happen to be in Mournhold, please drop it off with the proprietor of the Flaming Netch cornerclub. He will make sure it gets back to me, no matter where my next adventure happens to take me.\n\nSo here I am, forced to create my own record of the adventure I am tentatively referring to as ""Narsis Dren and the Exile's Barrow,"" because my scribe and apprentice has decided to wait outside. To be fair, I told her to remain at our camp, but that's rarely stopped her from following me before. Now she decides to listen to me! Ah well. I've recorded my own thoughts before. Back before I became the famous and beloved explorer I am today. It might even be fun!\n\n* * *\nI've been wandering around in this damn barrow for hours! I've seen all kinds of interesting, old Nord relics, and the place is just filled with crypts and stone coffins, but I haven't seen hide nor hair of the real prize I expect to find in this barrow—a Dragon priest mask! From the evidence I've been able to examine, I'm certain that a Dragon priest is somehow associated with this misplaced burial pit. After all, why else would the Nords build this place so far from their beloved Skyrim? I need to search a bit more before I call it a day.\n\n* * *\nWell, that was unexpected. I'm not exactly sure what I touched, but I must have done something. The Nord dead have started to wake up! They're draugr! And do you know how much I hate draugr? Well, I really do hate them—almost as much as my servant Borfree hates spiders! I need to get out of here and figure out a new strategy. And I guess I should warn the nearby village.

I'm more certain than ever that Graguz and his ""initiation"" of fire is a terrible approach to recruitment. It has a poor survival rate. Besides, fire panics people, and a panicked person cannot be reasoned with. A true conversion requires us to get into the candidate's mind, show him or her a way out of their fear, and help them come to the proper acceptance of Trinimac's holy grace. \n\nI think my method is a much more solid approach. (Ha. A pun. Solid. My ice is certainly that!)  Rooting an individual and trapping him or her using the new ice bindings I have crafted provides both pain and security without the unnecessary panic. The added benefit of giving a recruit the option to end the mild (in my opinion) torment is a brilliant idea if I do say so myself. I must remember to send a note to Hengart to thank him for the design of the switches and ice platforms. \n\nMy latest variation in the process seems to be the most effective yet. At the very least, it provides me with a certain level of amusement. I placed two candidates on the ice platforms at the same time and have provided each of them with a switch. And here's the genius of it! Each switch sets the other candidate free! So, which one will decide to sacrifice their own life so that the other may live? And the survivor? His or her guilt will open the path for Trinimac's light. The survivor will accept Trinimac more fully because he or she cannot accept that they caused another to die. The mind and soul will belong to the Vosh Rakh, and Trinimac, utterly and completely.\n\nThis dual method is a bit slower, I confess, but I am enjoying watching each candidate's resolve as it starts to crumble. More as the experiment proceeds."

Some stones heat up too quickly. This make the pain too intense too early in the process, causing a state where the uninitiated becomes too panicked to listen to reason and accept the ways of the Vosh Rakh. Rounder, larger stones heat up more slowly, allowing the uninitiated to better come to an understanding of their situation, which opens their minds to clearer thinking and correct choices. \n\nCandidates 124 and 125 from the latest recruitment drive show promise. Both are resistant, as expected. I'll try a simple barrier technique first, with no personal application of flame. Azhnura insists a higher wall of fire should be applied, but I feel strongly that managing the potential panic level is more conducive to a successful conversion. 125 seems likely to beg for release and will convert first—she's a good candidate for our warrior caste.\n\nCandidates 121, 122, and 123: Two did not survive the conversion process. 123 is with the healers, being treated for minor burns. He will be a suitable candidate for the Gauntlet, once the healers are finished with him.\n\nCandidates 119, 120: Panicked. 119 survived but is weak-minded. Useful as a loyal servant, but won't attain a higher rank in the organization. Turned over to others for training and initiation. \n\nCandidate 118: Fear of fire worked quickly after seeing what happened to the prior four candidates. Need to explore the usefulness of this method. Many people have a fear of fire, for reasons I will never understand. Probably some kind of innate cowardice. \n\nCandidates 114, 115, 116, 117: All resisted until the ""personal"" application phase. Each successfully converted, now undergoing healing. \n\nCandidate 113: Fainted, landed in the fire, and died before anyone noticed. Obviously, Trinimac wanted nothing to do with this one."

Orichalcum is green, exceptionally rigid, stronger than steel, and extremely temperamental. Just like most Orcs!\n\nMost miners, when they discover Orichalcum veins, see them as a welcome sight. Excavations tend to be less onerous given that Orichalcum is often found in brittle shale.  The deposits also tend to be free of gangue, making ore dressing unnecessary. The real challenges with the mineral can be found in the smelting process.\n\nOrichalcum is notoriously difficult to smelt. A consistent low heat must be maintained to prevent the metal from becoming brittle and cracking. Iron is often introduced to act as a binding, but most of the Orcish smiths I spoke to dismissed the idea as evidence of laziness or lack of skill. According to the famed smith Gurzbog gra-Gulog, pure Orichalcum is far lighter and stronger than its iron-alloyed alternative. After inspecting both metals, I'm inclined to agree. Both were remarkably heavy, but the disparity in weight was not insignificant. The Orcs' reliance on massive plate armor makes any difference in weight important.\n\nOrichalcum weapons retain their sharpness far longer than most weapons made with conventional metals, and they are remarkably resistant to rust and chipping. The unique color is also noteworthy—not as gaudy as High Elven glass and not as drab as iron or steel.\n\nI am eager to speak with more smiths here in Orsinium.

msgid "All right you slack-jawed, Elf-loving, inglorious bastards—simmer down! We're here today because some of you ugly runts have been complaining about a lack of ""honor"" in the arena, or some ox-piss like that. Look at you—a bunch of tuskless whelps with your heads up your arses! It's probably a waste of time, but I'm going to try to pound some hard-earned knowledge into your thick skulls.\n\nHonor. Bah! Let me tell you something about honor. Honor is the excuse that little orphans use to explain why their dear-old pa got sloppy and allowed some Wood Elf to kill him with a stone knife! Honor is the shield that covers your ego and leaves your arse hanging out in the wind to get pierced by an arrow! Honor is a brave Orc's worst enemy. The sooner you shake those chains off, the better chance you'll have in a fight. \n\nCombat is about one thing and one thing only—killing that other dumb bastard before he kills you. That means using your head, looking for weaknesses, finding gaps in the armor. Trust me when I tell you, honor is a big damn gap in the armor.\n\nFirst thing's first—if I ever see any of you whelps bow to an opponent, I'll beat you senseless. I say let that other bastard bow. The second your opponent looks down, you knock his teeth out with a knee to the jaw. \n\nNever let your opponent see. Dirt, snow, a flick of blood—just as useful as any axe and usually readily available. If you haven't flung something into your opponent's face before your second weapon swing, you're doing it wrong.\n\nAlways, always, always go for the crotch. Two or three times. A good kick in the nethers can make an ogre weep like a Breton girl who lost her favorite dolly. \n\nNever stop talking—and I don't mean pleasant conversation over tea and crumpets! You should be jawing about their ugly mothers, and their sister's creaky bed, and their father's yellow belly. It's best if you know these folks by name. It also helps a lot if what you're saying contains a ring of truth. And it's not enough to just say it—you've got to mean it! Angry fighters make mistakes, and mistakes will make it easier for you to kill them.\n\nIf you can't chop, kick. If you can't kick, punch. If you can't punch, bite. If you can't bite—well, if you can't bite, you probably did something stupid.\n\nAll right, that's enough for now. By Malacath's cracked tusk, I don't know why I even bother sometimes. Just adjust your nethers and get back to work!"

msgid "Ugh. Another day in Orsinium. Honestly, Clavel, if we don't return to Auridon soon, I may lose my mind.\n\nWhat shameless merchants operate out of this city! You'll never believe what one of these Orc vendors tried to sell me. I was minding my own business, examining an assortment of roots and snowberries—they were all shriveled and rancid, by the way—when this toothless merchant shoved a bowl of fat in my face.  A huge bowl of fat. Can you imagine? He claimed it was the fat from some legendary troll or some such nonsense. I asked him why anyone would buy such a thing and his rheumy eyes just lit up. Would you like to know more about troll fat? I'm something of an expert now.\n\nDid you know that troll fat is the densest fat in Tamriel? Denser even than horker fat? I bet you didn't. Apparently, it makes an excellent lubricant that's especially ideal for cold-weather use. And we know all about cold weather here in Wrothgar, don't we?\n\nArmor looking a bit dull? Why not rub some of this repulsive fat on it? I hear that no polish in all of Tamriel does a better job than troll fat! It can be used in poultices and various potions. It can be rubbed on window sills to keep out vermin. It can be dried and eaten as a kind of disgusting jerky. It can be boiled to make a particularly strong glue. It can even cure vampirism! Who knew?\n\nWhen he started talking about the many uses for troll fat in the bedroom, I had to take my leave.\nHe also mentioned that it could be used to talk to Malacath. That was at least a little interesting. Apparently, if you rub troll fat on an idol of Malacath, it allows you to talk to the Prince himself. I may have to try this. I'd love to ask him why his little green children peddle such atrocious wares!\n\nI'm giving this place another week.

msgid "A Study of a Religion Reborn by Ugdorga, the King's Scribe\n\nFor generations, Orcs have believed in three constant truths: the stronghold, the grudge, and the fury of Malacath. But before Malacath, at least according to certain traditions and a few noted scholars, there was Trinimac. The Vosh Rakh, a newly emerged movement that seems to be gaining in numbers and popularity, promises to take Orcs back to the roots of who and what they are as a people. To reclaim the glory of the warrior god Trinimac and restore the Orcs to their proper position in the world.\n\nIs it any wonder that this new religion has found adherents among those who have accepted the idea of a reborn Orsinium? For its beliefs and tenets seem tailor-made for the vision of a united Wrothgar. The Vosh Rakh claim they want to ""civilize"" the wild and riotous nature of the Orcs. They want to elevate the Orcs, to place them on the same level as the other races—or perhaps even to set them higher. And they want to rebuild the ancient city of Orsinium, setting it as the jewel in the crown of a new and powerful Orc nation. That said, although King Kurog has provided support for the new faith in Trinimac, going so far as to establish a temple in Orsinium, he appears to have no connection to the more-extremist followers of the Vosh Rakh.\n\nWho are the Vosh Rakh? That's not an easy question to answer. For every member of the movement keeps his or her identity secret, and when they come together to celebrate or pray, they wear golden masks of Orcish visages patterned after Trinimac's own auric-tinged skin. The name itself translates from the Orcish tongue as ""Blade of Courage"" and refers to Trinimac's legendary weapon, Penitent. They see themselves as Trinimac's sword made manifest, cutting a new path through the ancient and stifling traditions that—as they put it—have ""held back the Orsimer people for untold generations.""\n\nMany among the Orcish old guard see the Vosh Rakh as either a foolish fad that will soon fade away or as dangerous fanatics who will stop at nothing to destroy the Orcish way of life. Either way, the old guard refuses to be swayed by the arguments and the promises. They won't abandon the traditions that make Orcs—as they put it—""strong and powerful and better than any puny Elf."" They hold fast to the concept of the stronghold and the clan, rejecting the call to create a single Orc nation. They maintain the grudge, for ill will and resentment fuel the fire in their bellies and the anger in their hearts. And they maintain their steadfast faith in Malacath, god of curses and the betrayed, for he blesses them with conflict and the bloody Code of Malacath.\n\nBut the Vosh Rakh see the old guard as simply another challenge that Trinimac will help them overcome. Malacath, they claim, is nothing more than a weak and vengeful pretender trying to steal Trinimac's glory. Once the Orcs accept Trinimac and come together as a united people, then Trinimac will bless them with aid and succor in every battle set before them—from the battle to rebuild Orsinium, to the war against the Reachmen, and to fighting for honor and prestige among the other races, Trinimac will bring victory and glory to all.\n\nEnd Note: At the time of this writing, rumors have begun to circulate claiming that the Vosh Rakh has begun using deceitful, even deadly, tactics in their battle to win the hearts and minds of the Orcs. I have yet to substantiate these rumors as anything more than the angry words of members of the old guard, but I thought I should include them here. I will attempt to learn more and record my findings in a latter volume."

As each Orc clan and stronghold has a rich and vibrant oral tradition, this should come as no surprise. What did surprise me was how hard it was to form a coherent picture, as no two oral traditions agreed on even the most basic of concepts.\n\nIn this time of conflicting faiths vying for the Orcish soul, I found many of the tales I heard to be both extremely moving and extremely disturbing at the same time. Furthermore, I have been unable to locate a single tome related to the topic, or find a reference in any other books on related subjects. The only way to learn about the Orcish concept of life after death or a place of reward or punishment in a world beyond was by asking the right questions and listening to the various oral traditions. For after much research and countless interviews, I finally uncovered the Orc equivalent to the tales of the Far Shores and Sovngarde. Indeed, it was the only thing that the various oral traditions seemed to agree upon. And through them, I have discovered the Ashen Forge.\n\nFor the Orcs that revere Malacath, the afterlife promises rewards of immortality, abundant food and drink, and constant battle deep within the Ashen Forge. The Ashen Forge represents the culmination of the three constant truths of life among the Orc clans: the stronghold, the grudge, and the Code of Malacath. Let me explain each of these concepts and discuss how they relate to the Orc afterlife so that the meaning becomes clear (or at least as clear as each different stronghold attempts to make it). What follows is my best attempt to merge the divergent and sometimes conflicting tales into a single narrative.\n\nThe Ashen Forge sits at the center of Malacath's own stronghold in the Ashpit. According to some scholars, Malacath's plane of Oblivion consists of nothing but dust and smoke and ash. But his followers believe that the eternal emptiness contains all the things they hold dear and deem necessary to enhance their immortal existence. As the ultimate expression of the Orc stronghold, Malacath's Ashpit bastion stretches endlessly across the planes, extending even behind the stars to Aetherius, granting access to every worthy Orc who crosses from this life into the next. In Malacath's stronghold, every Orc is a chief, every chief has a thousand wives, and every wife has a thousand slaves to cater to their every need. The stronghold's walls rise one hundred feet into the smoky sky, constructed of polished steel and worked iron. Inside the walls, stone keeps, iron towers, and massive longhouses surround the central square that houses the Ashen Forge.\n\nThe Ashen Forge fills the endless space within Malacath's smithy, a massive hearth that burns with a fire said to be hotter than the sun. The thing that keeps this fire alive is the adherence by the Orcs of Tamriel to the Code of Malacath, but more on that later. Within this fire, every Orc must undergo the ritual of tempering when first they cross from this life to the next. They are thrust into the coals so that every grudge that he or she carried into the afterlife can be heated, melted, and eventually forged into the next generation of mortal Orcs. With the grudges of Tamriel tempered and returned to the mortal world, the immortal Orcs are now free to begin collecting a new set of grudges related to their new existence. Some particularly memorable grudges can also be hammered and worked into weapons or armor of legendary stature upon the Ashen Anvil, the gigantic work bench that stands beside the Ashen Forge.\n\nThe heat that fires the Ashen Forge comes from the burning, white-hot coals that are, according to the Orc lore-masters who would talk to me, the literal manifestation of the bloody Code of Malacath. They believe that the code fuels the fires of emptiness, betrayal, and broken promises, imbuing every newly forged Orc with a foundation of grievances and resentments that will take them far in the mortal world. The hope is that every generation will be better than the next thanks to the efforts of the generation before it and its ability to adhere to and follow the Code of Malacath.\n\nStill, Malacath's faithful believe that they will be rewarded with immortality, nourishment, and constant battle deep within the Ashen Forge. A life-everlasting filled with endless days of warfare, endless nights of fine food and drink, and ongoing opportunities to prove their toughness and demonstrate the quality of their steel.\n\nFascinating, really, especially when contrasted against the beliefs of Trinimac's followers. Unlike the oral traditions of Malacath that twist and grow with each telling at every different stronghold, the traditions of Trinimac's faithful was surprisingly consistent and they were happy to share them with me. High Priestess Solgra, especially, was extremely helpful in the preparation of this report. When a follower of Trinimac dies, she explained, he or she ascends to Aetherius to join with their ancestors. It seems that the afterlife for Trinimac's faithful also consists of endless war and celebrations, but with a greater emphasis on once again spending time with family members who came before you. In the end, I guess I found the Trinimac version to be somewhat tame when compared to the more savage and visceral beliefs of Malacath's faithful."

When you got the invitation to Orsinium, I was adamant that you were on a fool's errand and insisted that you stay and help run father's business with me. When your first gift arrived, I nearly wrote you to tell you how wrong I was. The generous sack of gold saved the shop and kept your brother-in-law and nieces fed for weeks. \n\nWhen your second gift arrived, I was intrigued. A curiosity, for sure! Those mudcrab-like legs. That adorable nose and furry back. I sold the cute little thing to a wealthy Breton, a traveler from Wayrest, who insisted that he must have it. He paid me a small fortune. Again, I nearly wrote you to tell you that I had been wrong all this time, but I put it off. \n\nA few weeks later, I'm glad that I did. \n\nI smelled them before I saw them. The Wayrest Breton, with this monstrous crested beast in tow, shouted at me from across the counter at our stall. He demanded that I return his gold, with an added gratuity, because this creature ate his fine silk shirts. Apparently this monster, now the size of a large tusked bull, liked to butt up against the supports of the Breton's house and nearly knocked it down. \n\nLucky for me, the magistrate decided the dispute in my favor: ""Let the buyer beware.""\n\nWhatever this beast is, you are a fool for sending one to me. Please do not send another. \n\nLove and kisses,\nYour Sister\n\nP.S. Feel free to send more gold though."

msgid "It was in the summer of my thirteenth year that I first discovered the whistle and my peculiar talent. I had long before then suspected that I had within me some latent and as yet-undiscovered skill that would, in time, set me apart from my peers and elevate me above them. \n\nAs a child, I had always related poorly to people. Consequently, I was the butt of many jokes and japes, especially among the bigger, stronger children. They had by then already begun to distinguish themselves as warriors, woodcutters, and in other burly professions, while my slight build caused me to lag far behind in such pursuits. But among animals I found many devoted friends, and so even at my loneliest, I was rarely without companionship.\n\nNow, it happened that some of the older children, being, as I have suggested, cruel and lording their superior strength over me, got it into their heads to play a mean trick upon me. The trick involved a whistle they found which produced a note that drove many creatures wild. The durzogs of our homeland were especially susceptible to the sound. They took me to a cave where a pack of durzogs had recently made their den and bade me to blow the whistle or else they would beat me. As I have said, these children were much stronger than I was and also very cruel; many times I had limped home from a beating I'd received at their hands. \n\nBut I think now that the threat of a beating would not have been enough to compel me to blow the whistle, had it not also been accompanied by jeers and insults that questioned my bravery. For though it was indisputable that I lagged behind them in physical strength, I was determined that none could outmatch me in courage or strength of spirit.\n\nTherefore, choosing what I knew would undoubtedly be the greater pain—though not so great a pain as the shame of being branded a coward—I took the whistle and blew a strong, clear note. I held the note longer than seemed wise, so as to settle the question of my fearlessness once and for all. My tormentors, on hearing the note, revealed their true nature and pleaded with me to stop blowing the whistle. They wondered aloud whether I was crazy and said that I had a death wish.\n\nI did not stop blowing the whistle, but held the note until I saw the durzogs emerge from their lair, teeth bared and lips curled. When I stopped, they stopped. For a moment, we stared at each other inquiringly. They were not more than a few paces away from me. They waited, as if for a signal. I put the whistle to my lips again and blew another note. The durzogs again approached, but their malice did not seem to be aimed at me. In fact, they seemed to implore me for instruction. I tested this theory by gesturing upward as I had done many times with my dogs at home. Like the dogs, at this gesture the durzogs reared on their hind legs, in unison. I tried again, blowing the whistle along with the gesture for ""sit"" and ""lie down."" The durzogs responded readily.\n\nNow the sight of this had lifted the fear from my tormentors, who now were begging for a chance to use the whistle themselves. They wanted to command the durzogs. I confess I took delight in refusing them, for finally I found that they were envious of me and I felt that I had earned their respect. \n\nBut the largest of them, a dimwit named Reggid, clopped me over the head and took the whistle. I had barely got my senses about me (such was the force with which he hit me), when I heard him blow on the whistle and registered the subsequent snarls of the durzogs. As my vision cleared, I saw the animals rush toward Reggid in a murderous fury. They leaped and tore at his flesh, and he cried out to me, begging for me to take the whistle and call the durzogs off. But I did not. \n\nThe others looked on in horror as the beasts devoured Reggid, but at that moment I felt nothing but pride. I have long held that animals can tell better than we who is virtuous and who is not, and that day I felt my beliefs vindicated. \n\nWhen the animals had feasted, they returned to their den to slumber. None of the others dared claim the whistle, and I have kept it with me all of this time. I use it in the taming and training of durzogs in many places across Tamriel. Never once have I had a beast turn on me. Never once.\n\nBut enchanted? The only magic in the whistle is the skill and courage I bring to it."

msgid "Vosh ball has a long and fabled history, going back to the earliest days of the Orsimer people. As the Orcs gathered into clans, they developed the concept of ""courage"" ball. It started not as a sport or recreational pastime, but as a way to test the bravery and resilience of clan warriors.\n\nThe earliest forms of vosh ball utilized a heavy sphere made of wood or metal that was about the size of an Orc's head. The novice warrior to be tested stood on the far end of a paced off court, staring down a battery of veteran warriors, each armed with a vosh ball. The veterans would each toss their vosh ball in turn, hurling it with as much strength as they could muster. If the novice was still standing after the volley of heavy missiles subsided, he proved his courage and was promoted higher into the warrior ranks.\n\nAs time went on, the test became an organized sport, with teams competing for honor and recognition among the clans. The heavy metal ball was replaced with a heavy leather ball, and rules and regulations were formalized and agreed to among the participating clans.\n\nToday, no gathering of clans is complete without a rousing, multiple-day vosh ball contest. Fharun clan holds the current record for ongoing victories, winning the last seven ""series of the clans"" by wide margins. Chief Bazrag of Fharun, the Fharun's most valuable player, has a particularly nasty and powerful toss he affectionately refers to as ""the bone-breaker.""\n\nWhile the rules of vosh ball are constantly changing, the basic structure of the game remains the same. Two teams of six Orcs each, all armed with a sling of three vosh balls, competes to control the enclosed court by rendering their opponents unconscious by hurling the heavy spheres with all of their might. Beyond that, there are dozens of rules and regulations that non-Orcs find confusing and contradictory. No matter. Anyone who has ever witnessed the game played in all its glory comes away excited, breathless, and with a renewed understanding of the definition of courage."

So far, I have seen only a handful of crows and chickens. They do appear to be slightly larger than their cousins in other parts of Tamriel, but other than that, there appear to be few distinguishing features.\n\n15th Rain's Hand\nFor more than six months now, I have traipsed back and forth across the icy wastes of Wrothgar, and I have found nothing worth recording. I have decided that I will begin making preparations to return home. \n\n19th Rain's Hand\nHow dark it is just before the dawn! Just when I had given up all hope, I found what may be the greatest discovery in the history of our society.\n\nYesterday, I was traversing a particularly remote area of the Wrothgarian mountains when I heard the distant chirping of a blue bunting. I thought I must be imagining things, but I decided I had no choice but to investigate. \n\nAs I followed the bunting's call, I began to hear other varieties of bird calls, and soon I traced the sounds to a desolate cave. Just looking into the mouth of the cave, I can already see blue buntings, canaries, cardinals, and even a green jay. Never before have I seen so many different birds living in the same habitat.\n\nTomorrow I will venture deeper into the cave. Who knows what I might find? I think this might be the most excited I've been in my entire life."

She blushed at being forced to wield smaller weapons, and other warriors, seeing her embarrassment, mocked her.\n\nWith a lighter weapon in hand, Bagrar became a fury on the battlefield. Her sword struck several times before her opponents could counter once, and her shield became impenetrable. She earned the title of Troll-Slayer.\n\nBagrar thanked Malacath for her prowess and dedicated herself, becoming the defender of the faith during the Balagog blood purge, and her shield became known as the Agra Crun—the blood shield."

msgid "An Excerpt\nBy Kraltha the Rememberer\n\nDuring the time of the Orsinium that was, the city that existed when the temple now known as Ire was originally constructed, six Orc clans rose to prominence in the region. Today, these particular clans have disappeared, either absorbed into more powerful clans or simply faded away, but at their height they had remarkable influence on Orc culture and the raising of Orsinium. Let's look at these clans and the symbols that identified them.\n\nClan Bragosh, the Hammer Clan\nKnown for their smithing skills, this clan created specialized armor and weapons and was known as a trader of goods and supplies. Evidence suggests the clan was eventually absorbed by the Morkul clan.\n\nClan Pandrum, the Fire Clan\nA clan rumored to be filled with primitive healers and shamans, they supposedly controlled fire, using it as both a weapon and a tool to take care of a variety of tasks. They seem to have disappeared from history after the second siege of Orsinium.\n\nClan Enclave, the Star Clan\nNot much is known about this mysterious clan, other than they provided aid to other clans for their own purposes. Rumors persist that the clan still exists somewhere deep in the Wrothgar wilderness.\n\nClan Luccin, the Wolf Clan\nThis clan was known for conducting effective and terrorizing raids during the night. They were adept at moving through darkness and often took their enemies completely by surprise. Some believe that the clan was eventually absorbed by the Shatul clan.\n\nClan Murtag, the Rock Clan\nOne of the oldest clans still in existence to the current day, this clan makes its home in the mountains of Wrothgar, carving dwellings deep within the very rock itself.\n\nClan Ruskahr, the Owl Clan\nA clan of highly skilled archers, they were known for their impressive tracking and hunting skills. They revered owls of all types, but especially the snow owl."

During the Battle of Fharun Pass, Uzdabikh rose from obscurity to become its most celebrated hero.\n\nReports concerning Uzdabikh's gender conflict, but Curator Umutha favors tales that describe her as female. Her warband was charged with defending a tunnel against encroaching Redguard soldiers, but no one expected them to send their entire army.\n\nOne by one her warband fell, until only Uzdabikh remained standing. She fought with bow, with axe, with knife, and even with bare hands until the tunnel was awash in blood. One-thousand-and-one Redguard died in the tunnel that day. It is said that her helmet was blessed, protecting Uzdabikh against every attack. But when reinforcements arrived, they found only Redguard corpses, piled high around her battered helmet."

The clans, already reeling from the surprise attack, retreated into the temple as the Bretons finally broke through the walls and swarmed into the city. The clan chiefs knew that  if they did not escape soon, they would die inside their beloved temple.\n\nAs they latched the temple doors behind them, the high chief turned and gave instructions to his oldest son. ""You need to open the way to the tunnels beneath the temple by setting the pillars correctly. Remember these words and the way will be opened.""\n\nAnd with that, the high chief spoke the following words. ""My eyes gaze upon the battlefield, but I feel calm. To my right, Clan Luccin fights with ferocity and keeps our enemy at bay. To my left, Clan Bragosh serves as our shield, protecting us from sights unseen. And above, Clan Ruskahr guards the hills, bows at the ready.""\n\nIt was now up to the high chief's son. He had to remember the words, to call upon his knowledge of the clans and their symbols, or the tunnels would never open and the Orc clans would fall. He could not let that happen."

He envisioned a grand city of prosperity and civilization—but he wanted it to be a reflection and advancement of Orc culture. To this end, he created a set of rights and privileges that defined the organization of the city, a document now known as the First Charter.\n\nThe First Charter preserves what Torug thought was most important about Orc life. When the first Orsinium fell, the First Charter was believed to be destroyed. But legend has it that the book survived as part of some raider's booty. The raider was killed on his way back to the coast and the book lost somewhere in the western mountains."

msgid "From ""Secrets of an Orc City""\nBy Grilbar the Architect\n\nWhen next the Orcs decided to rebuild the city of Orsinium, they determined to create a series of tunnels beneath the streets that would serve as an escape route should the city ever again fall under siege. These tunnels still exist in the current day, with the newest stones of Orsinium being laid atop their foundation.\n\nAs the king's workers continue to build the city, some of the tunnels have been sealed off or even collapsed. But many of the tunnels, hidden beneath the ancient foundations of older structures, continue to crisscross below the city streets. One of the most famous of these tunnels, described in the fictional account ""The Battle of Orsinium,"" is the Temple Tunnel, which was said to run from beneath the temple in Orsinium to the mountains behind Scarp Keep.\n\nAccording to the work of fiction mentioned above, a secret passage guarded the way to the tunnel. To access the tunnel, at least in the story, the high chief's son had to solve a riddle to open the secret passage.\n\nI look forward to a time when the priests of the temple allow me the opportunity to attempt to open the secret passage. Then we can determine once and for all whether Bangor the Liar's tale is based on facts or truly is a complete work of fiction."

msgid "I've spent a fair amount of time researching the wildlife of Tamriel, from the common (and fickle) mudcrab to the powerful and beastly wamasu of Argonia. When I was invited to Orsinium, I jumped at the chance to explore its untamed wilderness.\n\nBefore we even arrived at the city of Orsinium, my caravan was attacked by those filthy Winterborn. My protectors were either slain or fled into the hills, so I tried to follow. I soon found myself lost. In my panic, I fell into a small ravine. \n\nThat was the last I remember before waking up, surrounded by blue-furred giants. They seemed to take an interest in my well-being. Either that, or they were keeping me alive so that they could devour me later. Ogres, while technically of the Goblin-kin, are not known for their intelligence, but they are far smarter than most animals. As a rule, I do not study the intelligent races. Circumstances being what they were, I was intrigued enough to record what I was able to observe. \n\nFrom what I saw, the ogres of the Wrothgarian foothills are far more advanced than the crude brutes I've occasionally encountered near Wayrest. Several of them, elders I suppose, seemed to practice some sort of crude totemic magic that involved the manipulation of ice. One of them approached me and studied me with as much interest as I showed in them. That was when something amazing happened.\n\nMy leg was broken and bleeding from my fall, and I couldn't move. The elder raised his hand in the air and I braced for a strike. Instead, a beam of energy coursed into my leg, freezing it. I could feel the wound stitching together and the bone mending. The pain was excruciating, but I found it to be exhilarating at the same time. \n\nAs I stood up upon my mended leg, I heard grunts of panic and excitement from the ogres nearby. I thought I had frightened them, but there was a commotion from outside. The ogres, while not capable of conversing in the common speech, do grunt and vocalize. They all repeated the same thing. ""Urkazbur. Urkazbur!"" It was surreal. \n\nI exited the tent to find a scene of carnage. A larger, angrier ogre was fighting the other ogres. The large one had bony claws strapped to his arms. He slammed them into the ground. Ripples of ice shot out from the impact sites, slamming into the others and knocking them down. The ogre who had healed my leg tossed what appeared to be a glowing ball of snow at the larger one. When it hit him, he reared back and shouted. He gestured and the the snow around him rose up and formed into crude simulacrums and joined him in the fight. \n\nWhile the ogres were distracted by all this violence, I escaped. Perhaps one day when I've recovered fully, I'll return to see what became of ""Urkazbur"" and his snow simulacrums."

Torug found her a den in the far north. There, the snow bear slept, ate, and mated, passing on her bloodline to many powerful cubs. Eventually, Coldwind succumbed to old age.
