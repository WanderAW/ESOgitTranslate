msgid "By Associate Zanon, Clockwork Apostle\n\nOne must ponder the absence of academic interest in the field of factotums among the Clockwork Apostles. For machines that are so much a part of our daily lives, they are given very little thought. Few lectures are focused on them, few books are written. Why are these machines, so vital to the everyday processes of our existence, so ignored?\n\nFactotums are an invention of need, servants of brass created by Lord Seht to maintain his great creation, the Clockwork City. Repair factotums keep our many factories and functions running. Guard factotums secure the locations of our god's most dangerous secrets. By their metal hands our homes are kept clean, our food is served, and music flows throughout our streets. But how much do we truly know about the factotums which we work so closely with?\n\nThe answer lies in the mysterious nature of the factotums. Though our doctrines speak of mysteries, their importance and their prominence, they are still something we seek to solve. A formula, a theory, an answer which can be replicated again and again. That is what Clockwork Apostles seek with their fields of study, for why strive for innovation when there are simply no discoveries to be found?\n\nWhat we do know is that the factotums have a common appearance, voice, and sense of purpose. They hold a structured intelligence, often centered on their singular function. Their dialogue and actions are all based on this function, with only the commonality of a devotion to the Clockwork God. Attempts to deviate from this purpose is simply incomprehensible to them.\n\nAny further research towards factotums is constantly met with opposition. Their place of creation is heavily guarded. Their functions severely limit the amount of information they can give about themselves. We don't know which manner of magic or machinery goes into their creation. And that's exactly why we need to further our research on them!\n\nI seek to delve into the secrets of perhaps the most enigmatic of Lord Seht's creations. My research's focus will center on the structure, functions, and true purpose of these seemingly straightforward machines. I shall finally gain insight into what is perhaps the greatest mystery in all of Clockwork City."

msgid "by Acolyte Kelvivi\n\nAlmost without exception the native flora of Clockwork City are fully synthetic imitations of their terrestrial analogues, but there is one growth within the Halls of Regulation that remains a mystery. The ""Ironstalk Mushroom,"" as they have come to be known, often sprout in the dark, dank tunnels of the Halls. My dissections of several specimens lead me to believe that these organisms are fully organic, but their anatomy and suitability to their unlikely environment implies that they were designed with a purpose.\n\nThese fungi hungrily absorb minerals, alchemical remnants, and even corrosive materials with seemingly no ill effects on their physiology. Some have speculated that this is simply happenstance, that some Tamrielic spores were introduced to the halls by exodromal, took root, and thrived. That sort of dismissive justification is simply lazy, in my opinion. To off-handedly assume that Sotha Sil would not introduce a wholly organic creation to his grand design, if it served his purposes, is a discredit to his genius.\n\nI theorize that the Ironstalk Mushroom sprung from a need to purify pollutants from the Halls of Regulation that proved detrimental, or at least impractical for a machine to address. We occupy a world created with meticulous precision and care. It may be acceptable to dismiss the unknown as whim, or fate, or chance on Nirn, but in the Clockwork City there is only the Grand Schema. Here, there is always a greater explanation to the workings of the world."

msgid "By Varlinsi Arandu, Apostle of Sotha Sil\n\nMemories are fleeting, flawed, and fragile. So easily overwritten by emotion and prejudice. I cannot think of a more unregulated recording of events, which is why I commit my thoughts into the unchanging metal of my sequence plaques. But even the most objective view can still hold bias, and words can only convey so much. The engravings on this plaque pale to the complexity of a simple human thought, with all the nuances and richness that even a common mind can hold.\n\nLord Seht knows this. After all, his heart drives the Wheels Eternal, oiled and calibrated. This we know. To become that which is the only true name, which is not Name, one's mind must be polished. Synchronized. How to accomplish such a task? Even a god may become overburdened with the weight of emotions, fractured from the whole which is logic.\n\nBut in this too the Clockwork God was wise. He gave his memories form, manifestation. Glowing stars to make up the galaxy of his thoughts. Tangible and real, far more real than ink upon parchment, than words or whispers. Whole and perfect, and only able to be so from the strength of his divinity, his gleaming and peerless mind which holds the true order of all.\n\nMemories are flawed, yes, but they are precious all the same. They hold our wisdom and knowledge, all that which we are. To give them away would be squandering that gift, and this too Lord Seht knew. So he preserved these precious thoughts, locked safely with his Mnemonic Planisphere. Watched over by the ever-silent Astronomer. A multitude of stars which no longer held emotional sway over him, no, but still remained connected, known.\n\nIt's quiet in the Planisphere, but one hears whispers. A low hum of voices seem to echo within the halls. Those figures of the past, lost but not forgotten, come to light once more."

msgid "By Lector Tidras Dran, Clockwork Apostle\n\nEven in this shrine to knowledge and blasphemous inquiry, some subjects remain taboo. I spent all my long years as a Clockwork Apostle pushing against those boundaries—desperate to see our order truly live its creed: inquiry without limits. In most cases, I endured little more than sighs and grumbles from my superiors. But one topic in particular earns me forceful and genuine condemnation: my exploration of the factotum's inner voice.\n\nThe order's relationship with fabricants and factotums has always been prickly. On one hand, we must understand some critical aspects of these creatures' make-up. Their nature and materials informed the creation of our own enhancements. The synthesis of flesh and engineering remains one of our greatest achievements and most enduring traditions. However, delving too deep into the creatures' subroutines and manufacture starts to look less and less like inquiry, and more and more like hubris. Lifting Sotha Sil's skirts, as it were.\n\nFor my part, I have always been endlessly fascinated by the factotum's voice and behavior. While the factotums perform multitudinous different tasks, they remain linked by their appearance, voice, and confusing (some would say ""troubling"") verbal artifacts.\n\nWhen exodromals meet a factotum for the first time, they often ask, ""whose voice is that?"" Truthfully, no one knows (aside for Lord Seht, of course.) I've spent countless days in the Archivox researching Lord Seht's past. I even got special dispensation to visit the Mnemonic Planisphere once. I'm confident that the truth of the factotum's voice lies somewhere in Lord Seht's personal history.\n\nMost apostles avoid talking about it, with some notable exceptions, (my friend, Associate Zanon, for example.) If engaged privately, however, apostles will offer one of three major theories. Some believe the voice is that of Sotha Sil's mother. Others think it's the voice of a lost lover. Then, still others (myself included) believe it's the voice of Sotha Sil's sister.\n\nThe first and most compelling piece of evidence can be found in the Elegiac Replication—a personal memorial of sorts that Lord Seht built in the Radius long ago. One of the memorial plaques refers to a ""Sotha Nall."" It states that this Sotha Nall possessed a ""soul that deserved transcendence""—implying a life beyond natural limitations. Nall's face bears a clear resemblance to that of the Clockwork God, indicating that she was a close family member. Her garb does not appear matronly, and her posture does not conform to any psycho-artistic trends that would indicate motherly affection. Additionally, I've seen more than a few references to the fact that Sotha Sil was not an only child. Taken together, I think this makes a clear case for Sotha Nall as sister.\n\nNaturally, this leads to all kinds of uncomfortable questions about what a soul's ""transcendence"" means in this context. Does some aspect of Nall's animus exist inside the brass laborers we find all over the city? I would say ""no"" if not for the verbal artifacts.\n\nWhen faced with a query that requires higher cognition, factotums often recite a non sequitur in two parts—brief statements that have a loose connection to one another but no discernible connection to the larger conversation. These non sequiturs (also known as ""verbal artifacts"") tend to be simple recitations of household ""scenes"" They refer to overturned pots, rain on glass, boots by the fire, and so on. Occasionally they stray into more personal terrain, like the complexion of an old woman's hands, or the sound of someone weeping. Then, once in a very great while, they will say something genuinely troubling—statements like ""burning beds … screaming"" or ""collapsed roof … crushed child."" Factotums that say things like that tend to be recalled to the Pneumatic Forge in short order and taken out of circulation indefinitely. But this of course begs the question: where are these verbal artifacts coming from? Are they Sotha Nall's memories? Or some vital sub-function that enhances empathic responses to the concerns of living residents? Though it pains me to consider it, I believe the evidence points to the former rather than the latter. As everyone knows, the False Prince called Mehrunes Dagon, destroyed Sotha Sil's ancestral home of Ald Sotha when our lord was still a youth—leaving him as the sole survivor.  Scenes of fire and death may well have been Sotha Nall's final and most traumatic memories.\n\nI hope it's not true. I hope all these various observations are the product of simple coincidence. But, as scholars, we must acknowledge the possibility that these machines have a deeper and more troubling history than we realize. As I said before, I take my role as an iconoclast seriously. But In this case, perhaps it's best if we never know the truth."

Innumerable secure chambers, manufactories, laboratories, and terrariums house the objects of his experimentation, to be discovered and studied by the most diligent of his devoted Apostles.\n\nWithin this series of volumes, I shall describe in brief some of the more well-known of Lord Seht's minor realms within the Clockwork City. Know that this is far from an exhaustive list, for the breadth of the City may well be infinite within this seemingly finite space.\n\nMost familiar to denizens of the Brass Fortress is the realm known as the Radius. This stretch of fabricated wilderness stretches from the walls of the Fortress out to the periphery of the Clockwork City, and is home to an artificial ecology that was deemed by Lord Seht to be as familiar and soothing to denizens of Tamriel as could be crafted.\n\nPrimus, note the fabricant flora that sprouts from the metallic soil, its bark and leaves reflecting light in perfect quantities. It is true that very little grows within the Clockwork City, limited to dedicated projects such as the Wellspring or as transient fungi brought in by itinerant and accidental visitors. It is therefore necessary that many of the creatures one will encounter in the Radius are predatory. Fabricant beasts, designed to emulate the form and function of their Tamrielic counterparts, are indeed alive and constructed of an amalgam of grown flesh and metallic grafts. A wise Apostle avoids the most brute and hulking of these creatures, for they require sustenance apart from that which their soul gem matrices supply.\n\nSecundus, behold the accumulation of shimmering lubricants that pool within the lowlands and gullies of the Radius. This slurry is a mixture of machine grease, the humours and fluids of fabricant and Apostle alike, and a myriad of substances churned out by the incalculable amount of factories beneath the surface. The lubricants flow and are collected in basins across the Radius, to be drawn into automated cleaning facilities and pumped back into the devices that distribute them to necessary environments. Most of the lubricants in the Radius collect in the Mire Mechanica, presumably Lord Seht's approximation of Tamrielic swamps.\n\nTertius, the Radius is home to one of the numerous weather regulation and fluid treatment facilities in the Clockwork City. Our proximity to it ensures that we experience neither extreme heat nor cold, and that there is always sufficient clean water to ingest. Nevertheless, the delicate balance of fabricant, man, and mer demands that the Brass Fortress carefully consider its population and intake requirements.\n\nOf course, the Radius is only one of many realms within the Clockwork City. In our next volume, we shall touch upon some of the more unusual experiments conducted by the Father of Mysteries, as well as conjecture into the reasons for their existence."

msgid "By A Helpful Citizen\n\nGetting into the Brass Fortress from out in the Radius means getting into the good graces of the Clockwork Apostles. Trust me, if they're not on your side? You're cranked. That being said, they're not the easiest group to understand. The Apostles aren't chasing the glory of their ancestors or the thrill of battle. They don't burden themselves with thoughts of war, or famine, or disease. In fact, they rarely burden themselves at all, getting factotums to do everything but wipe their—but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start at what they do care about.\n\nSotha Sil is not only the god of the Apostles, but their mentor of sorts. The relationship is rather like needy students with a particularly distant teacher. The Apostles always seem to be seeking his approval on whatever project they're working on, though I doubt they'll ever get it. Their God of Mysteries keeps to himself more often than not.\n\nAll of the Apostles work towards one goal, something they call Nirn-Ensuing, or Tamriel Final, or Second Nirn, so on and so forth. If you want to bore yourself with the details, give the Sermons of Sotha Sil a read. And then another read. And then a third read so you can actually understand any of it, if you happen to be so inclined. All I know is that they're not so fond of this world, and they're trying to make it better. Somehow.\n\nNow you would think that making the world better would include what could generally be recognized as acts of generosity, or at least basic human kindness. You would be wrong on that account. You see, the perfect Nirn doesn't really include things like feeding the hungry or sheltering the sick. It does involve making a scrap ton of machines. For some reason.\n\nSo, to get in good with the Apostles you have to help them conduct their experiments of gods know what. This means demonstrating a knack with magic, machines, or probably both. If you don't have those skills handy I suggest you listen closely for some other opportunity. The Clockwork Apostles are not above asking for favors, especially if it's for a task they think beneath them. Sure, they might not have the easiest or most wholesome requests in mind, but I suggest you take the chance while it's available."

Behold the strength of untold calculation! Behold the power of the Mainspring Ever-Wound!\n\nEvery Nameless soul must confess the truth of Mournhold, for many lessons hide in its ashes. Sing now the hymn of anguish and horror, child of Seht! Behold, Mehrunes Dagon, Sovereign of Destruction! Mehrunes Dagon, the Flame Tyrant! Mehrunes Dagon, Father of Cataclysm! Recall how he marched upon Almalexia's jewel! Do you remember how his Will burned like kiln-fire, and hot pitch fell from his lips? Aloft, he held four great razors. Each sang a screeching paean to glorify him. Torrents of flame fell upon the innocent and wicked alike, shearing flesh from bone; belching forth widows and orphans in gouts of frothing screams.\n\n""Who dares to face me, draped as I am in fire and blood?"" roared Dagon. The dark Prince beat his breast and howled long-forgotten curses. The dead burst forth from their tombs, shrieking for mercy. Geysers of black liquid-sin erupted from below, flooding ruined homes with torrid lies and conspiracy. And everywhere, flames—an inferno that turned all souls to ash.\n\nAlmalexia, Mother of Mercy, cast her eyes upon the ruins of her gemmed city and wept. To see such love burned and squandered turned her heart to molten brass. Our Clockwork God took note of her fury, sealing the memory away in his great mnemonic planisphere—a reminder of her love's high price.\n\nRising from the ground like foundry-smoke, the Tribunes confronted the Prince of Disasters. Ayem's voice like a screeching steam-whistle, and Sotha Sil's like a lurching engine.\n\n""ERAM VAR AE ALTADOON!"" they cried, rending their garments and donning their killing masks. Ayem drew her bright Hopesfire and skipped over the flames like a river-stone. With a mighty scream, she plunged the blade deep into Dagon's breast and turned it like a jailer's key. Scorching blood spewed out of the wound, scalding her hands and face. As she fell, the Divine Metronome chiseled a thought-rune of infinite angles. Do you remember how the veins of tin, copper, and orichalc erupted from the depths to break our mother's Fall? Through His will alone, Mighty Seht wound the veins into god-bronze whips, and lashed the Prince pitilessly. Dagon hissed and tumbled backward. His otherworldly flesh fell like chaff before the scythe. Alas, a Sarmissonays'um ghoul-thing emerged from every chunk. \n\nA multitude of the creatures gathered around Ayem, fiery tar oozing from their mouths and open sores. They groaned and retched, speaking only Dagon's name as they fell upon her. The Warden hissed thrice, took up her blessed sword, and smote the beasts by the score. She severed head from neck and arm from shoulder, cleaving sin from virtue and shouting old-oaths of banishing. Do you remember how the beasts fell To her on that red day?\n\nYou must recall the howls of Madness! How Dagon foamed and snarled beneath the lash of Sotha Sil! ""Behold!"" cried the Divine Metronome as He smashed the Prince to splinters. ""Behold the wrath of lost Ald Sotha! Know death at my hands, false-son of a false-father! KAER PADHOME VIE ALTADOON!"" \n\nEven then, at the end, the Prince of Destruction did not relent. With the last of his four great arms, Dagon dragged the last of his four great razors across the Watchmaker's jaw. Tasting the blood on His tongue, our Father of Mysteries whispered a final chrononymic death-word, and Dagon exploded throughout all time. The earthbones quaked and the All-Axle shook. From this word of sundering, Truth took root.\n\nMehrunes's ruin slithered between the cracks of Nirn and Oblivion, shrieking curses like a petulant child. The Mainspring Ever-Wound tightened His brass-wrought fist and slammed the gap shut—another small step toward Tamriel Final. Anuvanna'si. So ends the true account of Mournhold's fall. Remember this tale always.\n\nBy the word, I wind the gears."

""The Clockwork sun,"" Gathal declared, ""it has neither the warmth nor the life-giving properties of the sun that hangs in the sky above Nirn.""\n\nOnce Gathal pointed this out, it seemed so obvious. The Clockwork sun provides light and gives us a consistent day and night cycle, but it does nothing to help the Wellspring's plants grow. We needed our own source of nourishing light. With that decided, Gathal and I set to work to invent a device that would replicate Nirn's sun.\n\nWe had some success with a limited light source, but it required us to utilize the factotums to constantly rotate the crops into and out of the nourishing light. This allowed us to harvest a small number of plants and begin the tradition of an annual harvest and apprentice selection. But we needed both an illumination device and a power source capable of simulating actual sunlight. We were so close, yet the solution seemed so far away.\n\nThrough trial and error, it took only a dozen or so iterations to perfect a suitable illumination device. When we hit upon a transparent lucent alloy to serve as the conductor for the simulated sunlight, we were certain we were on the right track. However, no matter how promising the illumination device appeared to be, the plants continued to die. We needed more power, but nothing available in the Clockwork City seemed to offer a workable solution. It was a conundrum!"

msgid "To the alienist, the ability—or inability—of a living mind to cope with stimuli and deprivation is of the utmost interest. How is it that some minds endure when others fail? What manifests in the aftermath of those outcomes? How can those manifestations be identified and altered? The workings of our own minds are as much a mystery as the workings of the material world, and it is no less dangerous to neglect their care than it is to mistreat the corporeal self.\n\nWhile Clockwork City is a facsimile of Nirn in many ways, it is not a duplication. Many of the rules that govern the world simply do not apply to this realm, and things often taken for granted in the terrestrial world are found to be of vital importance to an individual's sanity when they are suddenly found scarce. Here I will outline a number of the most common afflictions to develop in previously well-adjusted individuals now inhabiting the Clockwork City.\n\nCyclical Inert Ingestion — Compulsive craving and ingestion of non-nutritious and sometimes harmful materials. It is not unusual for inhabitants and visitors in Clockwork City to experience a palate fatigue for the nutriment paste produced within the Brass Fortress, despite its inoffensive taste and complete nutritional profile. This often causes these individuals to experiment with consuming unusual substances for relief from that fatigue or because of a fallacious belief about the benefits of ingesting the substance that they have developed a taste for. In many cases this condition may safely go untreated, though some individuals' compulsions pose a significant danger to their health and those patients should be remanded to the Asylum Sanctorium for a more controlled therapeutic environment.\n\nMagnusomnic Melancholy — Connections between mortal beings and the stellar bodies are well established, though fraught with superstition and apocrypha. Our relationship with the sun is of particular relevance to the psyche. From simple moodiness and doldrums in the long nights of winter to the violent, frenzied aversion of victims of vampirism, exposure to the sun has a noticeable effect on the mental health of many races, so its complete absence from Clockwork City is trying on most individuals. Lethargy, irregular sleep patterns, dark thoughts or impulses, and a general malaise are all signs that your patient could be suffering from solar deprivation. See volumes on treatment regarding variations of light conjuration and simulated sunlight.\n\nEncapsulation Syndrome — A particularly insidious affliction similar to the acute fear of being trapped commonly observed in the terrestrial world. Individuals used to living their lives under the open sky are sometimes disconcerted by the easily demarcated boundaries of Sotha Sil's heavens. They begin to feel an inescapable sense of confinement that creates ever-present feelings of anxiety and agitation. These mounting pressures will push them to breaking point if left unresolved and should be considered a priority for treatment.\n\nMinisculation Terrors — The terrors can be defined as bouts of irrational panic and paranoia that the victims are shrinking. It is unclear whether these episodes are a side effect of transitioning into this realm, or a pathological reaction to the experience of being miniaturized. Patients tend to describe peculiarities in their perception, ranging from a vague sense of things just being a little off, to vertigo, to delusional claims of evidence. For example, one such patient cited that they were now unable to reach an object they had placed on a high shelf the day before. Often these claims are a result of misremembered details, such as forgetting that they were wearing thick heeled shoes, though there is at least one recorded case of legitimate uncontrolled shrinking, so be diligent in investigating these claims.\n\nObsessive Focus and Fixation — Particularly common among apostles. Sometimes our colleagues must be saved from themselves. Clockwork City was designed with freedom from distraction in mind. It is a place of contemplation and learning, and sometimes the example Lord Sotha Sil sets is adhered to too closely by his followers. We are not gods. We cannot withdraw into our studies indefinitely and tirelessly without consequence. It may be necessary to intervene in the studies of an apostle who has developed an unhealthy obsession with their research. Fixated patients have been known to neglect sleep, forget to eat, shun all contact with others, and in some cases literally work themselves to death. As such, we are granted the authority to remand such cases to Asylum Sanctorium at our discretion. \n\nCorporeal Odium — Self-loathing, specifically of one's physical form. Outside of Clockwork City it was primarily observed in kingdoms where one's physical features or biological heritage play a significant role in an individual's societal worth. It is also a fairly common trait among possessing spirits. This condition is on the rise among Clockwork Apostles who believe their enhancements represent an ideal that their native flesh fails to live up to. Reckless augmentation, self-mutilation, and emotional volatility are all warning signs that an apostle's desire for alteration has become an unhealthy obsession and the patient should likely be remanded to the Asylum Sanctorium for psycho-spiritual realignment."

Our illumination devices work perfectly and have the capacity to channel light that is up to one hundred times brighter and stronger than what we can produce with the power sources available for our simulated sunlight inductor. We need a stronger power source or the Everwound Wellspring is doomed to fail.\n\n* * *\n\nAfter countless hours of testing and experimentation, Gathal has come to one irrefutable conclusion. Our simulated sunlight inductor requires life to nourish life. We've had some promising results by draining small amounts of life energy from volunteers and using it to power the simulated sunlight illuminators. The clear, bright light this energy produces makes our plants grow more quickly and more robustly than any other source we applied. The differences are nothing short of miraculous! But the borrowed life energy is fleeting and doesn't provide anywhere near the amount of power we need to operate all of the illuminators necessary to nourish all of our gardens.\n\nWe're so close, yet so far from a real and lasting solution.\n\n* * *\n\nI returned to the workshop to find a disconcerting sight. Gathal had attached himself to the inductor while I was away in order to conduct an experiment I had expressly forbade him from performing. It was his contention that we could extract even more life energy from the volunteers if we could determine the point at which the volunteer could still regenerate the borrowed life. If we could take that much and not a drop more, we might be able to power the illuminators. But if we took too much, a volunteer would die.\n\nUnfortunately, Gathal was too zealous in his application of the draining device. All of his life force fed the inductor, leaving nothing to provide power for his own body. My apprentice, my protege, was dead. Before grief could overwhelm me, however, I noticed an amazing thing. The inductor hummed with more energy than it had ever contained through our numerous trials and experiments. Gathal had solved the problem! The inductor required the entire life force of a subject to provide enough power to keep the Wellspring aglow with simulated sunlight for an entire season!\n\nThat's when I promised that Gathal's sacrifice would not be in vain. I announced that the harvest distribution would continue—as long as the Apostles agreed to provide me with a new apprentice every year. Those apprentices would be fed to the inductor, and the simulated sunlight produced by their life force would give us a bountiful harvest with which to feed the masses.\n\nIt was the perfect solution, even if the cost of our knowledge turned out to be so expensive."

Unassuming, discarded among the leaves and dirt. Any child could tell you those facts. And, admittedly, a child could also easily imagine what will become of the acorn, given simple knowledge. Of its possibility. Who among us does not know an acorn could one day become a tree?\n\nImagine, however, if one had never seen a tree before. Had never heard depictions or viewed drawings, and, without having been told of this tree, they are met with the simple acorn. Inconspicuous, small, inherently useless. Through all observations they could make, they are unable to connect the acorn presented to them with the image of a mighty oak.\n\nLike an acorn, the Clockwork City shows no signs of its grand potential to the unsynchronized mind. To Nirn Above it appears to be but a world in miniature, buildings and roads simply shrunk and put in a contained space. The plaything of a god perhaps, to hold his most loyal followers and dangerous experiments. But those who hold this view are simply ignorant of the possibilities.\n\nClockwork City is the center of the wheel for Nirn-Ensuing, the Omni-Axle that shapes the world. Rich in beauty and alight with sublime terror, so the scripture tells us. Sympathetic perhaps to the reality of Nirn Extant, but its own reality altogether, apart from the imperfections born from Lorkahn's Great Lie.\n\nHere we work under the Divine Metronome, our hands covered in oil, our hearts devoted. We are the welders, the seekers of hidden knowledge. We walk the path of the divine piston, our souls clean and well-oiled. The truth of our Clockwork City is that of the wheels Eternal, where one can hear the tick and tock of Tamriel final.\n\nSee beyond the simple acorn. See the mighty oak that it shall become."

msgid "By Ulysa Rervam, Proctor of Daedric Studies\n\nMy ongoing quest for information regarding the Daedric realms and their inhabitants led me to investigate rumors of a portal in the city of Davon's Watch. After much searching, I discovered an entrance to a pocket realm within the Evergloam, a place known only as the Crow's Wood. Similar in its ominous feel to the rest of Nocturnal's mysterious realm, the Crow's Wood appears as a dark marsh full of dangerous creatures. Most notably, a murder of intelligent, talking crows inhabits the area and considers the place to be its personal kingdom. Here is what I learned during my brief sojourn to the Crow's Wood.\n\nThe crows organize themselves using a feudal system and refer to their flock as the Blackfeather Court. These birds claim to be the spawn of a hagraven they call the Crow Mother, and they constantly strive to defend their domain from wolves, giant bats, and other predatory creatures that roam the shadowy realm. The Duke of Crows leads the Court. This large, proud bird presides over the rest of the flock because, as he tells it, he's ""the smartest and biggest and loudest"" crow in the murder. Indeed, for these noisy, talkative birds, the ability to stand out among the crowd is considered not only a necessity, but a symbol of prestige. The rest of the flock clusters and conspires around the Duke of Crows, engaging in their insistent plotting and politicking for status and favor.\n\nNot that the Duke of Crows appears to do much more than preen and bluster. The real work of the Blackfeather Court, such as it is, falls to the Seneschal of Carrion and the Court Castellan. Both of these birds serve the Duke of Crows, but they evidently have the freedom and authority to perform independently to keep the Court operating efficiently—or, at least as efficiently as any group of intelligent birds can manage. The Seneschal of Carrion takes care of the assorted domestic arrangements for the Court, as well as acting as the steward for the Duke of Crows. The Seneschal also adjudicates the various tributes of death and carnage regularly heaped upon the Court. (Although to be fair, except for the tributes they requested of me, I saw no one else seeking the favor of the Duke of Crows and his flock during my visit.) The Court Castellan, on the other hand (wing?), acts as the governor of the Court. This involves overseeing the various knights and knaves that serve the Court, including the Knights of Marrow, Pith, Gore, and Vitreous, and the Knaves of Rooks, Pipes, and Ravens. As with everything surrounding the Court, there appears to be more attention paid to pomp and circumstance than to actually accomplishing anything of substance.\n\nEventually, it falls to the Bursar of Tributes, a feathered accountant of sorts, to sort and catalog the tributes of death and carnage that add to the Court's ever-growing hoard of shiny objects. The crows charge visitors who enter the realm, either a toll of flesh or silver, to grant temporary safe passage through the Crow's Wood. Anyone who refuses to pay, be they featherless tourists or birds of a different persuasion, is subject to any and every disgrace and degradation the crows can come up with, including incessant cawing, pecking, and foul droppings on heads and fancy clothing. I paid the toll for an opportunity to wander among the Court and talk to its members, but it isn't clear to me that such a payment was absolutely necessary. They are just crows, after all.\n\nAs I prepared to depart the Crow's Wood, the Knave of Ravens sidled over to me, fixed me with her curious sideways gaze, and uttered this ominous proclamation: ""Pay attention, featherless cur! Today the Blackfeather Court rules the Crow's Wood. But tomorrow? Tomorrow the Night Mistress has grander plans for our respected murder!"" The word followed me back to Tamriel, along with an echo of caws. ""Murder!""\n\nI may never feel completely safe around a gathering of birds again."

msgid "By Proctor Albacron, Second Innovator of the Sacred Flywheel\n\nThe Great Gear, a concept first put forth by Lord Sotha Sil and later expanded upon by his Clockwork Apostles, illustrates the idea that all of existence can be expressed as the workings of a finely tuned machine. The Great Gear represents nature's primal engine, the source of life and power that makes Nirn thrive. It isn't a literal engine. The Father of Mysteries used the metaphorical idea of a primal engine to expound upon his teachings and philosophy. The apostles that learned from Lord Seht followed his example and built upon the metaphor to create a rich and expressive manner of speaking that sets them apart from other followers of the Tribunal.\n\nBy employing a variety of metaphors that utilize the workings of gears and pistons to express emotions, thoughts, and intentions, the apostles have developed a distinct dialect that draws upon their vocation and beliefs. Here are some of their more cherished idioms, along with the meaning for those not fluent in the movements of the Great Gear.\n\n""By the Great Gear!"" An exclamation of wonder or surprise, although it can also be used to proclaim shock or even horror in the appropriate circumstance.\n\n""Never in a million clicks of the Great Gear."" An idiom for emphasizing the impossibility of a given event or describing something that is unlikely to happen.\n\n""The gears just have to align in my favor."" An expression of hopeful intent, favorable conditions, or the desire for everything to come together in a positive way.\n\n""When the gear slips."" A phrase used to express that something isn't quite right or a situation has become off kilter.\n\n""Clogging up the gears."" An expression that means something was spoiled, usually through blundering or stupidity.\n\n""Before three gears click into place."" A phrase used to hurry things along or to indicate that very little time has or will have passed.\n\n""Caught in the gears."" A statement of concern, usually related to a difficult situation, a troublesome predicament, or a problem that doesn't have an easy solution.\n\n""May your gears spin freely."" A friendly farewell, wishing the recipient good wishes and continued success.\n\n""May your pistons never clog."" A phrase used to wish another person well as you send them on their way.\n\n""May the Great Gear always spin in your direction."" A way to wish good fortune upon a Clockwork Apostle or a close friend or associate not related to the order.\n\n""Tighten the cogs."" To shore up, reinforce, or make better.\n\n""The clockwork is only as strong as its weakest cog."" A phrase with a literal meaning, though the ""weakest cog"" also figuratively refers to a person or other flawed feature and not an actual cog.\n\n""The Great Gear never pauses in its rotation."" A phrase that assures us that time passes and the world moves on, whether we want it to or not.\n\n""Spare a few more clicks of the Great Gear."" A request to give someone or something your attention for a time.\n\n""The Great Gear turns, so be quick, be quick."" Time passes, so don't dawdle.\n\n""Sometimes the Great Gear turns from frustration to opportunity."" Any of several similar sayings that indicate that situations can change from favorable to unfavorable, or vice versa, usually by the whims of fate.\n\nAnd that is the sequence of the words."

I must be loyal. The shadows will catch me. I once thought myself quick, clever, able to pick any lock, there and back without a trace. I was ready, willing to give all to Her. I could not do otherwise, I knew. I felt. The darkness had seeped into my skin. I could taste it on my tongue, like the oil that coats this city. \n\nHer shrikes sang to me, a haunting tune. I can't describe it. I don't want to, I can't, I won't. Always singing. The rhythm beat itself into my blood, my heart pumping in time. Slow, steady, slow, steady. Always singing, dreams coated in black. I'm drowning, I can't breathe, but Her song fills me still.\n\nI'm creeping, crawling, a roach of Clockwork. Her insect, set to Her bidding. Shadows, I've become a shadow. I'm darkness, a stain upon the wall. My blade is coated in blood, red against the black. Warm, so warm, but my fingers feel like ice.\n\nI'm trapped in brass, in cogs and wheels. The singing remains, but the song is gone. No tune, no music, but whispers set to rhythm. Serve Her, be shadow, be whispers. Creeping, crawling, but I can't escape. I'm caught in the darkness, tar which clings to my clothes. I speak but am silent. I see but am blind. Blind, so blind, to nothing but Her will.\n\nThe crows are laughing, but I cannot. The shrikes are singing, but I cannot. The world is bright, but I am darkness. I am whispers.

He sealed the great pool beneath a thick layer of metallic soil with the intention of creating a lush oasis inside his mechanical wonder. He called it the Everwound Wellspring and explained a little of his grand plan to his apostles. But the Clockwork God, easily distracted by other challenges and countless mysteries, stepped away to deal with other things and never returned. In time, his apostles moved on as well.\n\nAll except for me. I believed in the oasis project. I understood the vital need it fulfilled for the Clockwork City. So I began to work on the Wellspring myself, eventually attracting apprentices of my own. Soon, this compound rose up from the metallic dust and our experiments took on greater depth and significance. Our earliest successes revolved around mosses, molds, and fungi—living creatures that could thrive in a dark environment with nothing more than water and a bit of fertilizer to nourish them. Bolstered by our accomplishment, I set our sights on the most elusive prize.\n\nI turned our efforts to growing actual fruits, plants, and vegetables to supplement the diets of the Clockwork City's living inhabitants."

msgid "A Report for the Proxy Queen\nBy Penewen, Advisor to the Court\n\nTo Her Magnificence, Proxy to Queen Ayrenn,\n\nI continue to follow up on the rumors that members of the Psijic Order have returned to the world after a long and unexplained absence. I have it on good authority that at least one prominent Psijic monk, the High Elf Lilatha, has made an effort to contact champions with a warning concerning the return of the Clockwork City of Sotha Sil. I shall endeavor to discover the reason for these reappearances and try to determine if they point to the return of Artaeum as well.\n\nOur military leaders have expressed concern over these events. A number of our religious scholars have also expressed concern, as they appear to be evenly divided on the opinion as to whether or not the return of Artaeum (if indeed it has returned) indicates good portents or ill omens.\n\nI uncovered the following details about the island from ancient records. Idyllic orchards, clear pastures, and misty woodlands make up the majority of the island's terrain, along with a number of still and silent lagoons. Eyewitness reports from more than five hundred years ago—the last time Artaeum was known to be present off the southwest coast of Summerset—describe the unique architecture that appeared to be as natural as the countryside surrounding it. The Ceporah Tower supposedly rises above the isle. This relic from an age before the High Elves serves as the headquarters of the mysterious Psijic Order and guards the entrance to the Dreaming Cave. Legends say that Sotha Sil, among others, used the cave as a sort of portal for traveling to the realms of Oblivion. The records indicate that Artaeum disappeared from its location in Tamriel some three-hundred-and-fifty-years ago. \n\nThe gray-cloaked members of the Psijic Order, a magical monastic society that pre-dates the Mages Guild, once served as advisors on spiritual and magical matters to the rulers of Tamriel. Whether these sightings of Artaeum mages signals the return of the Psijics to political concerns, we have not yet been able to determine. We have also not been able to confirm if the long-lived Ritemaster Iachesis stills leads the ancient order, as numerous requests to meet with Psijic representatives have been ignored.\n\nAdditional information about the Psijic Order follows.\n\nThe Psijic monks follow the ""Old Ways,"" combining mysticism, the Eleven Forces, and the divine laws that bind and define the nature of reality into a philosophy and way of life. They are said to have a deep understanding of the Ehlnofey, also known as the Earth Bones, the descendants of the Aedra who once walked Tamriel and gave rise to the races of man and mer. Much of the ritual-based magic the order employs utilizes this understanding, supposedly granting them influence over time and weather. In their day, they were the world's preeminent scryers, capable of perceiving events across great distances of time and space. It is said that they also command powers of communication superior to other practitioners of magic.\n\nWhat this means for Summerset and the Aldmeri Dominion has yet to be ascertained. It would behoove us to acquire the services of the Psijic Order for our alliance, but so far they have refused all efforts on our part to open a dialogue of any sort. We have also received reports from spies in Morrowind that Sotha Sil's Clockwork City has been located. His association with the Psijic Order and Artaeum are well documented, so I shall make a journey to the land of the Dark Elves to conduct a scouting mission and try to determine if the return of the Psijics and the opening of the Clockwork City have any connection. It could be that something significant is brewing at a level well beyond our mortal concerns.\n\nI will return as soon as I am able.\n\nAdvisor Penewen"

msgid "To best ascertain and determine the needs of the residents of the Clockwork City, Lord Sotha Sil commanded me to create a series of factotums for the express purpose of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting social and environmental information in order to accurately predict trends and demands of the populace.\n\nAs the first model created, the Clockwork Analyst was designed for the primarily menial task of collecting and analyzing data relevant to the citizens of the Brass Fortress. This first generation analysis model factotum specializes in counting births and deaths, tracking residents and registered visitors, and recording illnesses, wealth, and social factors necessary to predict trends in the settlement. Once the concept is fully tested and vetted, we shall expand the project to the rest of the Clockwork City.\n\nThe pass phrase for interacting with this factotum's memory core is ""Magus commands you.""\n\nTaking everything we learned with the first generation factotum, we next created the second generation prognostication model. This factotum could take the data collected by the analyst and use that information to make accurate predictions concerning the wants and needs of the citizens. In this way, Sotha Sil could anticipate the needs of his guests and satisfy them before they ever realized they had any outstanding wants to gratify.\n\nDuring the process, however, a flaw developed in the prognostication model's sequential analytical processor assembly. The predictions it provided regarding certain individuals went far beyond mere statistical analysis and ventured into the realm of actual prophecy. This flaw was first noticed after the Magus himself tinkered with the mechanism, so we cannot be certain that this was not what Sotha Sil intended. But the Master has vanished again. I shall store the prognostication factotum in the valley outside the Brass Fortress and lock this prophetic mode with the pass phrase:\n\n""Prime sequence eleven, thirteen, seventeen.""\n\nThat should keep unauthorized prophesying to a minimum until the Master returns and I can ask for guidance regarding his intentions."

msgid "By Endilaril, Naturalist\n\nThe possibly-futile quest to find my place as a naturalist stranded in a world of the unnatural has led me to a dangerous field of study. And trust me when I tell you of its danger, for my past observations have taken me to quite hazardous locales. I've studied the fearsome senche-tigers lurking with the green depths of Grahtwood. I've followed tracks of the deadly behemoth through the poison swamps of Murkmire. I've researched the horrid frost trolls prowling the icy mists of Eastmarch's mountains. So believe me when I tell you that the fabricants of Clockwork City are some of the most dangerous creatures I have ever attempted to observe.\n\nA fabricant is unique to the biome of Clockwork City, and I thank Auri-El every day that they are not able to spread their evil throughout Tamriel. These unwholesome creatures of beast and machine stalk the plains and ravines of this counterfeit world's wasteland. They come in many gruesome variants, and all present dangers to the unwary traveler. And make no mistake, they will kill any intruder on sight.\n\nThe verminous fabricant is unlike any creature I have seen before. It may be smaller than many monstrous beings in Tamriel, but it's also quick. This fast and agile creature attacks with metal claws resembling small scythes, and a pointed horn protrudes from its snout. Its lithe form means that it is able to follow you into smaller spaces, and trust me when I say that these creatures are relentless in their hunt.\n\nThe nix-hound fabricant is far more familiar, though I still shudder when I feel its lifeless, glassy eyes upon me. It's covered in brass, its back leg replaced entirely with metal limbs. Its gouging snout now has the edge of a blade. Given time, this creature will build up energy to produce a scalding beam. I've seen flesh melt and mer die after being struck by it.\n\nThe beetle fabricant was obviously modeled after the thunderbug, though why Sotha Sil thought that this already dangerous creature needed metallic updates I'll never know. Each of its scuttling legs has been replaced by metal limbs, and its lightning attacks seem to have a greater force than I have ever seen in nature. Like its other counterparts, this creature is aggressive, and will attack on sight. All caution should be taken if you see this monster in the wild.\n\nViewing these amalgamations of natural and unnatural, one has to ask why these creatures were created. And created they were, by the Clockwork God himself. Why would Sotha Sil willingly choose to bring about such monsters into the existence of Nirn? My research has led me to believe that few are courageous enough to ask him.\n\nPerhaps they are simply an experiment gone wrong, or guards to protect his precious experiments. Whatever their reason for existence, fabricants remain a very real threat within the walls of this world-prison. I will continue to study their existence to best know how to avoid, escape, and perhaps even put an end to their miserable existence. I very much doubt the absentee Father of Mysteries will even notice my attempts to undo the madness he has wrought in his own city."

I have my doubts.\n\nI've never kept a journal. It always seemed like an act of vanity—putting all your life's pursuits to paper. As if anyone would want to read them. But given the circumstances, I think it's worth the effort. I find myself in a very strange place—the Clockwork City.\n\nIt was not an easy trip. I don't remember much. There were trees. Valenwood, I think. I remember striking something with a summoned blade, then a flash of light. The rest? Nothing but whispers and pain.\n\nWhen I came to, I found myself suspended in a glass sphere—submerged in some kind of viscous fluid. Polished metal clamps kept my shattered limbs in place, while tiny mechanical creatures stitched the flesh to new brass appendages. To my great surprise, I felt no need to breathe—just a deep thirst, and a dreamy state of mind. I saw a tall Elf gazing at me from the other side of the glass, his face warped by the curve of the sphere. He identified himself as Sotha Sil, and told me that I would live. He also told me that I had a son.\n\nThis came a surprise. I had no idea I was even pregnant. Apparently, the factotums discovered the tiny, barely viable child while they rushed to stabilize my ruined body. In Tamriel his severe prematurity would have been a death sentence, but here the impossible seems effortless.\n\nI never had any intention of having a baby. Toting a child around while making war on the Akaviri hardly seemed practical. But time and circumstance make fools of us all.\n\nI named him Marius—after my paternal grandfather. I hope this journal will serve him well if I succumb to these injuries. He should know something of his heritage at the very least.\n\nDate: 15 Sun's Dusk, 1E 2712 (?)\n\nThe more I learn about the Clockwork City, the more it appeals to me. The Brass Fortress provides few comforts. It's a dry and hard place—full of strange machines and stranger people. Dark Elves mostly. I've met Dunmer before, of course, but these Clockwork Apostles seem like a breed apart. They revere logic and innovation above almost anything else. Can you imagine? My fellow battlemages always mocked me for my dedication to cold reason. ""Where's your fire, Luciana?"" As if there's no fire in rigorous thought.\n\nSotha Sil still checks in on me from time to time. I've never met another person like him. The apostles worship him as a god, but I get the sense that it makes him uncomfortable. He only occasionally makes eye contact—not out of timidity, though. He's just always focused on something else. A device, or a book, or some other clockwork oddity. I ask him questions whenever the opportunity presents itself—questions about the nature of this place, his motives, his history. I never get straight answers. Nonetheless, he seems to enjoy the back and forth. I get the sense that even here, surrounded by worshipers and loyal machines, he remains profoundly alone.\n\nThe apostles keep telling me that blasphemy is acceptable here—even encouraged. But it seems like a belief without a backbone. My caretaker, Lector Marilia, was aghast when I told her about my conversations with the ""Clockwork God."" For example, I asked Sotha Sil about those persistent rumors—the ones about how he and the other Tribunes murdered Indoril Nerevar, the Dark Elf king. According to Marilia, the topic is strictly taboo. Even so, Sotha Sil answered my questions with a quiet grace that surprised even me.\n\n""Why do you think things happen?"" he asked. I told him I didn't understand the question.\n\n""Why are we sitting here talking? Why does young Marius exist? Why do I reign over this place, while you convalesce within it?""\n\nI sat quiet for a moment, then replied: ""Because that's just the way it is.""\n\nHis cold face melted into one of his solemn half-smiles. ""Exactly.""\n\nI can't be sure, but it seemed like relief in his voice. His shoulders relaxed, his tone shifted—he had the look of a man at peace with his sins. Soon afterward, he thanked me for the conversation and left the room in silence.\n\nI looked down at Marius, sleeping soundly in his brass crib. In that moment, things seemed to make sense. The Clockwork City finally started to feel like home."

Better that the whole batch go bad than the spores be allowed to take root outside the Halls of Regulation.\n\n—Remove from heat and leave the sealed cauldron to age at least a week.\n\nI have found no discernible difference in the properties of mushrooms aged longer than a week, but attaching a vintage to each batch has been highly effective at negotiating a premium on my older stock."

msgid "Date: 12 Evening Star, 1E 2713 (?)\n\nAfter a year of contemplation, I've decided to take my place in the ranks of the Clockwork Apostles. At least I think it's been a year—time moves so strangely here.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision. In my heart, I've never stopped serving my liege, Reman Cyrodiil. But the conflicts of Tamriel seem far away now. Akavir, Valenwood, Colovia; they all feel so distant—so detached from everything that matters here. In the Clockwork City, labors matter. Logic matters. Order matters. As an apostle of Lord Seht, I can make a real contribution. And I can honestly say, if anyone is worthy of supplanting Reman Cyrodiil in my heart, it's Sotha Sil.\n\nI struggled with the thought of worshiping him, initially—mostly because he seems so uncomfortable with the idea. I worried that our conversations would cease, or that he would think less of me. Luckily, he seemed pleased when I told him the news.\n\n""I can think of none better."" he said. Then he knelt down beside Marius, and took his tiny hand. For a moment, he seemed very distant—mournful almost. Eventually he whispered, ""Your mother is both mighty and wise. I am glad I found the two of you.""\n\nI don't know why, but I blurted out, ""Why did you save us, anyway?""\n\nSeht paused for a moment, then whispered, ""Because one day you will shine a light.""\n\nBefore I could ask him what he meant, he vanished. Marius laughed at that. He never gets tired of seeing Sotha Sil dissolve in light. For my part, I felt a sense of unease. I hope I didn't offend him.\n\nDate: 26 First Seed, 1E 2721 (?)\n\nSomething is wrong. Marius collapsed again. According to the monitoring factotum, he grew weak and short of breath, then fell down just outside the Cloisters. This is the third time in as many weeks.\n\nAt first I thought he just pushed himself too hard. Nine year-old boys have a tendency to overexert, and he's always been a bit frail. But when I found him in his room, his face was pallid and there was a rattle in his voice. He asked me what was wrong. I told him I honestly didn't know. I'll take him to see the Factotum Medica tomorrow. \n\nDate: 9 Rain's Hand, 1E 2721 (?)\n\nAfter days of tests, the factotums and clinicians finally gave Marius a diagnosis: birth-related heart defect. Apparently, the circumstances of his birth (my ruined body, his severe prematurity, and the journey through the veil) caused some kind of hemorrhage, or twisting of the arteries. In Tamriel, he'd likely be dead already. Or rather, dead a second time.\n\nI asked for a prognosis, but the factotums refused to offer one, citing a wide range of potential outcomes. He could see thirty or he could die tomorrow. In either case, his life will be difficult and brief. I remain (uncharacteristically) optimistic. Lord Seht has mended worse injuries and brought people within a breath of passing back to life. Here in the Clockwork City, a defect like his can't possibly be terminal. I will petition Sotha Sil as soon as he emerges from seclusion."

msgid "By Varlinsi Arandu, Apostle of Sotha Sil\n\nThe outside world is not unknown to the Apostles, but mostly ignored. What need have we to know of the history and cultures which fragment so frequently, broken apart in so many inconsequential ways? The Dark Elf Houses, the Breton monarchs, the warlords of the Orcs. What purpose does learning of their petty squabbles and worries serve to lead us towards the Chrononymic Will?\n\nIf there is any topic of any worth, it is perhaps the environment of which the rest of Nirn is forced to live within. Factoring out the ever-changing influences of man and mer, we are left with constants that the et'Ada Gears have created. Sunlight causes green leaves to grow. Winds affect weather and temperature. And water, that which all life is dependent upon, flows through an endless cycle. \n\nThere is limited knowledge of the water cycle which all things depend upon. Water is heated by the sun and turns to vapor. The vapor floats up within the sky, creating clouds. The clouds grow heavy and release their burdens, letting the water once more return to earth. And so it goes, a never ending-wheel.\n\nThe water that flows naturally throughout Clockwork City, commonly known as Seht's Blood, is rich with the overflow of our innovation. The unfortunate side effect is that it makes this water completely undrinkable for our residents. But in all things He is wise, and in this too He had a plan. \n\nOur home is shaped by the Divine Metronome, by the will of Lord Seht who sees the correct sequence. Yet even He knew of the beauty in this cycle, in this never-ending circle. And so He gave those who obeyed him the gift of water, of life, within the Halls of Regulation. Where everything is in perfect synchrony.\n\nAll water flows to the Halls of Regulation, where first it is filtered through fine mesh to separate larger sedimentation. Next the water is sent through the distillation initiator, powered by the cleansing magic to disinfect finer contaminates. Without this magical process, many toxins would still be present in the water when used by the citizens of Clockwork.\n\nThe cleansed water is then distributed to either the water reservoir or vapor manifold. The water reservoir retains all water given to the Brass Fortress, be it for drinking, bathing, or cleaning. The vapor manifold, however, holds equal importance, for it creates the humidity in the air which allows for organic life. Without it the very air we breathe would be deadly.\n\nSo join with me in praise for this most important of cycles, created gleaming and perfect by the will of Lord Seht. Perfect and perpetual, ever set in regulation."

msgid "Date: 31 Last Seed, 1E 2750 (?)\n\nI'm not sure why I'm writing this. I kept this journal for Marius's benefit, but he's gone now. Twenty years gone. Time supposedly makes things easier—dulls the pain. But my grief is deeper now than it's ever been.\n\nBusyness. Order. These things help. I threw myself into my work—marshaling the apostles into a stronger, leaner, more effective order. I cracked down on crime, published a treatise on Marius's alchemical experiments, focused on my spellcraft; but none of these accomplishments come close to filling gaping hole my son left behind.\n\nI never told anyone what took place in the Cogitum all those years ago. People are rightly afraid to broach the topic. Even now, twenty years later, my anger glows white-hot.\n\nBetrayal—that's the only word I can think of. I forded through the Centralis as quickly as I could, destroying any hostile factotum, fabricant, and mechanical trap that stood between me and Lord Seht. When I reached the Throne Aligned, I found Sotha Sil sitting on the stairs leading to his seat of power. He didn't even look up.\n\n""I know why you're here,"" he said.\n\nI was so naive then, I smiled and rushed toward him like a child. ""Good!"" I cried. ""We have to move quickly. Marius is near to passing.""\n\nBut Sotha Sil didn't stand up. He didn't even look me in the eye. ""I am sorry,"" he said. ""I cannot give you what you seek.""\n\nI stumbled over my words, trying to understand what he was saying. I just repeated myself like an idiot, thinking perhaps that he hadn't heard me. ""Marius is dying. We have to get back to him as soon as possible!""\n\nHe stood up and pursed his lips before speaking. ""I'm sorry,"" was his only reply.\n\nWe stood there in silence for what felt like an eternity. Eventually, I shook my head and whispered, ""I don't understand. My body was ruined and you healed me. It's only Marius's heart that needs mending.""\n\nSeht approached, placed a brass hand on my shoulder and said, ""You misunderstand. It is within my power to heal Marius, but circumstances make it impossible. I grieve with you, Luciana.""\n\nI looked up and there were tears in his eyes. I felt a great rage rise up within me. I reached for my hammer, and lifted it above my head just before Seht whispered a banishing word and sent me hurtling back toward the surface.\n\nMarius died two days later. Sotha Sil remains in the Cogitum Centralis to this day.\n\nThe other apostles offered the same trite consolations I used to give to the grieving parents of men who died under my command in the Imperial Legion. ""It was his time."" ""He lived a good and honorable life."" On and on. But in my heart, I will never forgive Sotha Sil. Never. I will remain a proctor of the apostles. I will always safeguard the city I love, and uphold the laws and traditions of the order. But my adoration for the Clockwork God has shriveled and starved.\n\nThis is my final entry. For any who choose to read this journal, know only this: Sotha Sil gives and takes without consultation or mercy. Do not mistake his interest for empathy. Do not mistake assistance for authentic acts of kindness. Some are saved, others are sacrificed. That's just the way of things in the Clockwork City."

The oil of antiquity often fuels the future. Those who ignore the counsel of our blessed ancestors do so at their peril. But not all ruins hide wisdom within their shattered halls. Some ruins are dark and barren places—unsteady graves for lies and curses. Resting places for bent axles, stripped bolts, and the bitter silence of inertia.\n\nIn the time before our Father's rise, old and feeble knowledge ruled the hearts of Mer. The children of ash entered their ancestral tombs not in search of truth, but in search of truth's corpse. They saw their forebears not as proud and vigorous guides, but as wheezing, toothless ghosts—guardians of the musty and derelict engines that fools call deep wisdom. You must smash these old machines, child of Seht! The past does not rust upon the scrap pile. It hurtles toward the Mainspring Ever-Wound's glorious and multi-angled future, whipped by the scorching tongues of our honored forebears! Ever do their words and deeds grease the wheels of the Nirn-Ensuing! Ever do they weld the seams of Tamriel Final! Anuvanna'si.\n\nBut alas! Even now, stewards of The Old feed aged truth to those who would listen. They are the daughters and sons of PSJJJJ who crouch like gargoyles over musty tomes, faces hidden beneath frayed and graying robes. They counsel caution, temperance, and equanimity—ancient virtues of the fading Nirn-prior. Even so, the Father of Curiosity calls them friends. With a god's patience, He teaches them. With a father's love, He guides them; all in the hopes that one day they may see the deepest truth of The Old: that we must banish our feeble ghosts and give their memory new life through the thrice-folded mind. Toothless gears cannot be repaired—they must be melted and reforged. So it is with our people's truth.\n\nNone will deny that the daughters and sons of PSJJJJ wield great power. Like our Clockwork City, their isle of Artaeum glides between what is and what may be. Like our Clockwork Apostles, they study, strive, and create. But power without an infinite future's courage is like an empty boiler—infused with fierce heat but producing no steam. Woe upon those who recoil from Tamriel Final! Anuvanna'si. The will of the Clockwork God turns such cowardice to slag. But rejoice! The Father of Mysteries' affection proves the PSJJJ's worth. One day these lost spellweavers will heed the words of the Divine Metronome and seek the true and noble change—the aratagnithir. On that day we shall embrace them not as friends, but as brothers and sisters.\n\nBy the word, I wind the gears."

msgid "A Record of My Studies in the Clockwork City\nBy Barilzar, Apprentice to Sotha Sil\n\nToday marks the twenty-sixth click of the gear, on the fourteenth rotation of the cyclical time-keeper, since I was selected by Sotha Sil as a Clockwork Apostle and apprentice mage and entered the Clockwork City. The place continues to fill me with awe and wonder, perhaps to an even greater degree than when I first set foot inside the tiny, domed complex. At first, I couldn't shake the crushing fear that accompanied my initial entry into the city. I was terrified of the shrinking process and the thought of being turned into a miniscule version of myself gave me nightmares for days before the transition was set to take place. And when it occurred, I'm slightly embarrassed to admit, the sensation of shrinking didn't exactly agree with me. I suppose I shouldn't have had such a big breakfast right before, but the scrib jelly on wickwheat toast smelled so good!\n\n* * *\nSo many things to get used to, working in the Clockwork City! First off, everything is made of metal, though sometimes the forms and shapes can deceive the eye into thinking an object is composed of an entirely different substance. Second, we utilize sequence plaques instead of paper for inscribing notes and maintaining records. Very much in keeping with the aesthetics of the place. Third, the jargon developing within this small, closed community would be almost impossible to understand if I hadn't been here when it started to take root. Allusions and metaphors concerning clockwork mechanics fill our conversations and punctuate our statements. It even slips into our humor, such as it is. Sometimes it even feels like we're trying to upstage one another with who can construct the most perfect turn-of-gear phrase, but who could ever imagine that Clockwork Apostles would compete with one another? Well, except for that Albacron. He's a netch's arse.\n\n* * *\nLord Seht requested my assistance in an unusual series of experiments today. He calls them his Nine Analyses of the Exalted Enigmas. I'm still trying to align my gears with his godly contemplations, but the experiments seem designed to test the limits of Sotha Sil's divine power. He outlined the entire series as he imagines them, but we only conducted the first of the experiments today. It was fascinating, even if I couldn't comprehend more than half of what I witnessed. Perhaps additional understanding will dawn as we conduct the remaining eight experiments. And I hope something explodes. I love explosions!\n\n* * *\nLord Seht develops the most interesting and practical tools. When he required a tool to drain away minute bits of his own divine energy to store and study, he crafted one to his exact specifications. When he desired an instrument to measure the precise distance between different ""locations"" in Oblivion, he crafted that, too. What about a device for recording and analyzing our surroundings? He calls that his ""perception tabulator."" I hope to one day be able to invent and craft devices that are half as useful as the contraptions he throws together when he's bored or even working on something else. He's the ultimate multitasker!\n\n* * *\nThe longer I spend in the Clockwork City, the more I come to appreciate it as a wonder and a miracle! From its brass tunnels to its glass domes, its metal plating to its giant gears, I can barely begin to understand all of its potential—and I'm one of the apostles helping to expand and fine tune the construction! Other than the tasteless paste the city provides as the only source of nutrition, the place is nearly perfect. It makes me sad to realize that I'd need a hundred lifetimes to study and understand even a third of what was required to design and construct this marvelous invention. I wonder, could I extend my life in order to continue the work I've dedicated myself to? Something to research at some future date.\n\n* * *\nNovice Kellu attempted to add a sense of humor to the factotum personality sequencing. It went as well as can be expected. Of the three factotums she attempted to enhance with her whimsical algorithms, one exploded, one ran into the Radius and hasn't been seen since, and the third stands in the corner and mutters to itself. The words are low and hard to understand, but I'm sure I heard the poor mechanical repeating ""knock, knock"" over and over again.\n\nMaybe it's time to take my leave and find my own place in the larger world."

Only the blackness behind our eyes.\n\nBut the monster has lifeless eyes. They're hollow, not black, just nothing. Nothing, nothing, they stare through you. Between you. They peck and peck. Nothing shining will move them. Nothing to sate their unending appetite. Swarming, gathering, collecting, a mass of darkness.\n\nThey're angry, always angry. Hungry. No laughter, no mocking, just hunger. They'll peck, peck, with bony beaks that snatch. Gouging murders, arcing darkness. Talons to cut, shred, tear. Tearing, tearing.\n\nThey summon more. Crows cawing, gathering, and then they laugh no more. Tease no more. Speak no more. Her pets are nothing now, pecking, pecking hunger which stalks. Which tears. Which feasts.\n\nI dream of them as I sleep beneath the stars of Her Oblivion. They simply stare. Staring, staring, nothing eyes filled with rage. Filled with hunger. My flesh will not satisfy them, but they crave it, I see it. I cannot offer anything but myself, and I don't want. Not that. I have been consumed by Her. They cannot have me.\n\nThey peck and peck, but I am a shadow. My flesh is darkness. I am already devoured by Her."

Stars splattered like flecks of paint. Falling, streaking across my eyes. A dark forest encroaches, filled with Her creatures. Wolves of shadows. Spirits haunting. Her Shrikes which sing, sing just for me. A melody which I cannot hum.\n\nBlue lights fill Her land. Mesmerizing. Blue flowers that glow in the darkness with a kind light. Deceptive light. Yellow fires burn, burning against the blues and purples. Crypts lie, submerged in murky waters. Cold, cold, as cold as my hands.\n\nHer land is decay, bloated and purple. The trees cast long, dark shadows. The path is winding, branching. There's a castle in the distance, broken apart. This world is broken apart. Crumbling, crumbling. The stone is crumbling, like my mind is crumbling. Tumbling, tumbling, into decay. Into Her shadow.\n\nI walk within this shadow world into a counterfeit one. The realm of a Prince to the creation of a god. From soaking green to burning sand. The sun is blinding, weakening. I am a shadow, banished with the light. I crave it, but it hurts. I cannot have it. I cling to darkness as the darkness clings to me.\n\nI sleep but find no rest, no night to come, no morning after. Just dusk, endless and gloomy. No rest for us wicked souls. Nightmares swarm, swarm like her crows. Endless eyes watching me. Singing which lures me in. The darkness seeps beneath my fingernails, under my eyelids, between my guts. Like tar, I'll fall apart if I rip it out.\n\nMy Mistress lulls me into this slumber, into this nightmare. I cannot awaken for I have become the nightmare. I am one of Her shadow creatures. I am the wolf that howls, the spider that crawls. The spirits which haunt this plane. \n\nI will feel nothing as I strike. I have nothing left to feel, save Her."

He spends most days in his room, studying or conducting his alchemical experiments. I'm pleased to report he has a rare gift when it comes to potions and tinctures. He loves to forage for reagents. Of course, finding living ingredients can prove difficult in the Radius. I restrict his adventures in herbalism to an hour a day. He resents me for it, but he's smart enough to know why he can't remain outside the walls of the fortress for long. \n\nThe Factotums tell me that each passing day makes Marius's condition more serious. I hope that Lord Seht emerges soon.\n\nDate: 5 Second Seed, 1E 2724 (?)\n\nThree years and still no sign of Sotha Sil. The other Clockwork Apostles tell me it could be decades or even centuries before he returns. Obviously, Marius and I don't have that kind of time.\n\nWe've settled into a comfortable routine nonetheless. While I attend to matters in the fortress and help tame portions of the Radius, Marius tinkers away with his flasks and alembics—laboring for the glory of Sotha Sil. He keeps pestering me about limb replacement, saying that a brass hand could help increase accuracy during sensitive measurements. I keep telling him ""maybe next year,"" but I'm not sure how much longer that will work. He's strong-willed. Bull-headed even. Can't imagine where he gets that from. \n\nHis experiments continue to astound. To everyone's surprise, he invented a palliative that reduces his heartbeat to a quarter of its natural tempo without any obvious side effects. The factotums estimate it might increase his life expectancy at a commensurate rate. But again, nothing's certain. Direct intervention by Sotha Sil remains his best chance for recovery. If the Clockwork God doesn't come out of seclusion soon, I may have to take matters into my own hands.\n\nDate: 14 Sun's Dusk, 1E 2728 (?)\n\nMarius turned sixteen today. At least I think it's sixteen. Time inside the Clockwork City moves in mysterious ways. We celebrated with a trip to the top of the Clockwork Basilica. I had to carry him most of the way, as he doesn't have the stamina for long walks anymore.\n\nI'd never actually been to the top of the tower before. Sweeping vistas are meant for poets and lovers—I am neither. I spend my days in the dusty streets and the lantern-lit hallways of the basilica—shielded from the raw immensity of the city. But as I watched Marius marvel at Seht's bands sliding along the glass of the Celestiodrome, and the harsh desert of the Radius stretched out below, something moved inside me. I saw that this city truly is my home—more of a home than Cyrodiil ever was. I see now that I will never return to Tamriel. I will live and die here in the Clockwork City.\n\nDate: 22 Second Seed, 1E 2730 (?)\n\nThings move quickly now. I found Marius slumped next to his alchemy table this morning—barely responsive. I moved him to his bed, summoned one of our foremost clinicians and a handful of factotums to watch over him, and prepared for my journey into the Cogitum.\n\nThe more senior apostles urged me to reconsider, but patience is a luxury I can no longer afford. Only Sotha Sil can save Marius. If I can wake Lord Seht from his dreams, I know he'll do what's necessary to save my son. May Seht bless these honest labors. Time to go."

msgid "By Proctor Neimos, Apostle of Sotha Sil\n\nGiven the unprecedented reveal of the seventh advancement of the factotum model, my attempt to give individualized names to each unit has been deemed ""unnecessary and unreliable"" by the Congress of Calibration. I have now been tasked to only identify groups of units that perform similar functions. I have to admit, this only further shows a sad misunderstanding of the unique personality each unit so clearly expresses. Still, I must abide by the ruling of the council. And so here I shall list the name and brief description of each factotum subgroup for future reference.\n\nClockwork Registrar: This singular unit is able to access all residential records within Clockwork City. It also maintains all documentation within the Brass Fortress archives, the extent of which none but Lord Seht knows. I find this unit to be direct and to the point, making it very efficient to work with.\n\nClockwork Clinician: Though few in number, these clinicians have been purposed for a variety of post-mortem tasks. Their most prominent ability allows them their cognitive archival process and data retention of the recently deceased. This has been used for a variety of occasions, most notably with questioning Proctor Nevyn on several incomplete thermodynamic equations. I find this unit to be a more comforting presence, but often impatient when delayed.\n\nClockwork Facilitator: A newer, singular unit introduced to the Brass Fortress, it has nonetheless proved to be a liaison to Lord Seht's own experiments. Currently its only function is to recruit combatants to battle a creation known as the Imperfect, said to be one of Clockwork's most dangerous creations. From what I can gather, this unit will continue to create tasks based on the ""greater good"" of Clockwork City. I find this unit to be more boisterous than its counterparts.\n\nCommerce Delegate: These units have multiple functions to aid residents with purchases. Though the Clockwork Apostles do not regulate commerce, my suggestion to lease these units to local guilds has been met with approval and is currently undergoing negotiations. I find these units to be friendly and lighthearted compared to many other factotums.\n\nCurrency Steward: Continuing with the need for help with the residential currency system, these units have access to all banking records and regulations. They have helped decrease the ""errors"" often found in their less reliable, and often merely greedy, organic counterparts. I find these units to be serious, grim, and very reliable.\n\nCuisine Administrator: Though any resident can work a nutrient dispenser, these units have several functions related to cooking. The consensus of their successful meals has been noted to perhaps be biased by the local population, given the bland daily diet of most Brass Fortress residents. Nonetheless, all meals generated have been deemed perfectly safe for consumption by the Clockwork Apostles. I find these units to be almost coddling in their affections.\n\nI will continue these rudimentary and functional classifications for factotums within the Brass Fortress. Further preparation is needed before I can begin my research on the more combat focused units, as our means to place them in standby has been unsuccessful for several generations. May the gears align in my favor."

msgid "By Proctor Nevyn, Apostle of Sotha Sil\n\nThe Clockwork Apostles dedicate their lives to many things. The words of our Sermons, laid before us by the ever-faithful Deldrise Morvayn, Fourth Tourbillon. The will of our god Lord Seht, the Mainspring Ever-Wound, the Divine Metronome. The driving forces of inspiration, of innovation, of discovery in all forms, magical, technological, spiritual. But we often forget, in our pursuit to unravel the mysterious of our world, that we are also subjects of the Tribunal. \n\nI have found throughout my long tenure that many of my pupils have a hard time grasping the threefold nature of our belief within the Tribunal. Still, despite the repetition of these questions, I never rebuff this curiosity. Rather, I try to encourage it, for there is an abundance of contradictions within our piety towards Lady Almalexia and Lord Vivec. After all, the worship of these deities seem to almost challenge the beliefs we hold so true within our order. \n\nWhy are we told to worship these often puzzling deities alongside our sound and steady Clockwork God? Why must we follow not one god, but three?\n\nYet even this seemingly simple fact is but a misconception, for in this sequence we have found truth. ALMSIVI is but one entity, not the fractured creation that many perceive it as. It only appears fractured in the forms our gods have taken, but rather than separate deities they are all one portion of a welded whole. Regulated in their irregularities. Lady Almalexia and Lord Vivec, who are only consistent in their inconsistency, still create the order of our truths. They are the tock within our Lord Seht's tick, the wheel that forever goes forward but only to circle itself. \n\nThey are the truths of our chaotic present, the irregular oscillations that we must weld together. Within them we find the aspects of our humanity, the soul which merges with the machine, ambition which merges with beneficence. The act of faith itself seems contradictory to the importance we hold on evidential certainty. But not one among us is completely machine, cold and logical without the emotions which bind us together. No, we are welded beings, as varied and complex as our three gods. Fractured parts which have come together to create our individuality.\n\nHow does one devote themselves to such aspects? To these traits of Nirn which are not logic and order, our guiding principles? The Sermons tell us to understand their limitations. To pay heed, but know the boundaries of their scale. Know that these are the principals needed for our current world, Nirn-Prior, and shall be but an addition to the whole which is Nirn-Ensuing.\n\nHold tight their words, their laws and limits. Know that they are the echoes of a fractured selves, welded whole. Know that the Sublime Piston gives and takes in equal measures, sundering the Named pursuits of lesser mer. We must tear apart that which will be welded whole once more. Beliefs, structures, laws, one day outdated and unneeded.\n\nAnd so we pay our respects to these aspects of our deities. Without faith towards ALMSIVI we ourselves become sundered from the truth. Speak the names of Lady Almalexia and Lord Vivec with respect, with piety. Listen to their words and heed their laws when necessary. They are the broken cogs that reflect ourselves, to be as venerated as the truths that we honor."

Apparently I'm the latest person to show up in about a hundred or some such years. I told them, ""Wow, not a big tourist town huh?"" They didn't really laugh at that one. Or any of the jokes I've told so far, if I'm being honest. But hey, rambling on about something I barely know about? Now that's something I can do.\n\nThey suggested I start with observations. Said that was the most ""objective"" viewpoint I could give. Huh, well, not really sure what they're getting at there, but I'm going to ignore that bit of advice because I think that I should start with myself. After all, who gives a skeevers arse about what I have to think if you don't know who I am? That's what I always thought, you know, reading stories. \n\nWell, a little about myself. I'm your typical mage, I suppose, in how typical the ability to summon fireballs and teleport around is. Not particularly powerful or anything, which the Apostles sure were disappointed about, let me tell you. I get the feeling that they only care about folks who have a real hand at magic, or good with the contraptions they've cooked up here. I already know a few apostles who told me that they were simply very, very skilled at working the machines here, and that was sort of an in for them. Not that I really want to join a bunch of Dark Elves who worship Sotha Sil, mind you.\n\nHow did I end up here? Now, I'd really like to know that myself. See, I was apprenticed with a Telvanni mage just recently, an unconventional character who had a tough time keeping apprentices around. Now this mer, I'll tell you, real big Clockwork City aficionado. Really big on getting here too. I mean, talk about an obsession, he would just lecture us all nonstop about the ""wonders of the omni-axle"" and all that. Not that he really knew what exactly those wonders were, but hey, he knew they were here.\n\nLong story short though, he wasn't wrong. And he would have gotten his wish, had I not been a beef-wit and stepped into the portal first. Well, I mean, more like tripped. I keep hoping he'll show up, but from what I could tell it was a one way trip? Something about the movements of the planes or something like that. Prime conditions that aren't likely to pop up again. Just my luck, that.\n\nNow that I'm here though, well, not so sure my old boss would be particularly keen on this place. I mean first off, it's pretty much a wasteland. Smells like I'm trapped in a tin cup. Heck, everything is metal. The trees, the creatures, the people! They have metal limbs, and from what I can gather they just do it for some sort of fashion trend. Gives me goosebumps.\n\nAll right, my caretakers here are telling me I'm out of time. They're going to perform some more tests on me, I think. Take bits of my hair and spit for ""analysis."" I'm guessing they'll keep asking me to write down my thoughts though. Unless one of the factotums can read my mind? Huh. Wouldn't be surprised."

msgid "By Endilaril, Naturalist\n\nOh, how I longed for the lush landscapes and diverse wildlife that make up Tamriel. How did I not appreciate it before? The green fields of Auridon, the deep woods of Valenwood. Skyrim's majestic mountains, topped with snow. The dangerous beauty of Black Marsh. How I missed it all, reduced was I to this city of brass, surrounded by barren wastelands.\n\nOr so I thought, for quite the longest time. My life's work was not the study of machines or people, but rather the animals that surround us every day. I despaired when I first came to Clockwork City, thinking my career as a revered naturalist had come to an end. But all I had to do was look a little harder, and eventually I found new species to study, ones made of metal and gears rather than flesh and sinew.\n\nI've compiled a list of the more memorable species of ""creatures"" found within the city, if I may be so bold to call them that. Their appearance certainly mimics their more natural counterparts, and strangely enough so does their behavior. What their creators had in mind, I do not know. They seem to hold little function, but rather add life into this barren land. \n\nBrassilisk\n\nThe brassilisk is created from interconnected brass squares, exposed copper wiring allowing for its snakelike movement. Popular as a pet, you'll often see them following the quick footsteps of young scholars. A rather lovely and most prized model mimics the leathery wings of the sep adder. This creature comes in a variety of colors, and while it may display aggressive behavior it is not equipped to attack others.\n\nSkeevaton\n\nThough I do not delight in speculation, the rumored origins of this creature do fascinate me. The skeevaton takes the form of a copper mouse. It possesses no legs, traveling by a rotating ball fitted within its middle. In a city filled to the brim with mechanizations of all kinds, what could be more inconspicuous? The legend goes that its inventor created the skeevaton with the purpose of spying on his or her fellow scholars. Something to keep in mind the next time you see one of them staring up at you from the alleyway.\n\nSeht's Dovah-Fly\n\nThis mechanical insect that flutters through the stagnant city air is thought to be a collaboration of two ill-fated lovers. Once again, I'm not usually one for rumor, but this story does have quite the emotional appeal. Two apprentices fell in love, but were forced to never see each other because of a long standing feud between their lectors. Seht's Dovah-Fly was created as a messenger, delivering communications between them. So impressed were their masters by this elegant creation that they set their feud aside and allowed the apprentices to collaborate on future projects. A delightful tale I must admit, whether it be true or not."

msgid "By Rosalind Frenrick, Stranded Mage\n\nHere I am again, writing down my thoughts on the Clockwork City. If I had to hazard a guess, the Clockwork Apostles weren't too keen on my last report. But you know, I don't think they're really keen on me period. So to keep in their good graces, and out of the Radius, I thought I'd share some more ""objective"" observations.\n\nI'm currently living in this city called the Brass Fortress. It really does look like a fortress from the outside, with high walls and big gates. There is no getting in unless you're invited, but it isn't really needed for things like war parties or bandits. There's no one here that isn't registered. I mean, perhaps there's some poor souls lost in the wastelands that surround the Brass Fortress, known as the Radius. I'm guessing they're not registered or anything, but I'm not rightfully sure. Least I'm safe here.\n\nWell, all right, truthfully? Not everywhere in Brass Fortress is safe. In fact there are quite a few ""off-limits"" areas here filled with rather nasty fabricants and these rather testy factotums. Fabricants by the way are these strange creatures that are a mixture of metal and flesh. Gave me nightmares the first time I saw one. From what I can understand they were created by Sotha Sil? Not sure why. They scare the ever living daylights out of me though. \n\nAnd the factotums, well, they're like metal people. They got heads and arms and everything, but they're simpler than living folk. They have tasks they do and they just do them. They'll answer questions sometimes? It's odd, because they act like people. Well, like very devoted servants. Who only think and talk about serving. And they're very keen on completing whatever task they've been set to do. They're interesting enough, I suppose.\n\nYou know, the Clockwork Apostles are pretty simple too in their interests. They really enjoy inventing oddities and discovering odd bits of information. They're real keen on Sotha Sil and everything he does. Got a giant statue of him right in the square. They quote his sermons a whole awful lot to. Doesn't make much sense to me, but at least they're not cultists or anything.\n\nNow here's a funny thing that I'm still wrapping my head around. These seemingly very reason driven individuals believe that the Princes and Daedra don't rightfully exist. Right. I mean, I've seen a clannfear rip men apart. Pretty sure it was real. I guess it's a little easier to believe that though, given that there doesn't seem to be any Daedra here. Not sure why? I guess Sotha Sil is just particularly vigilant about keeping them out.\n\nNow it isn't all Apostles this and Sotha Sil that here in Brass Fortress. In fact, most of the citizens are just normal folk like myself. Well, as normal as anyone can be growing up in this strange land. There's the merchants and the craftsmen, blacksmiths and chefs. They even have their own slums, though that came as a surprise. They call the folks there Tarnished, unwanted vagabonds and whatnot. I've talked to a few though and they seem a decent lot. Then again, most of the poor folk I've met are.\n\nI can tell you that no matter your lot in this city you never go hungry. You see they got this gruel here called nutriment paste. Consistency of porridge, and taste of … well, not much taste to speak of. You can add spices or toppings to make it a bit more palatable, but given that everything is made of metal here, that's a bit hard to come by.\n\nGot to cut it short here. More tests. Hopefully they won't make me run so much in this one. I'll make sure to keep writing down my thoughts. Helps me make sense of everything that's happening."

msgid "By Varlinsi Arandu, Apostle of Sotha Sil\n\nTo follow Sotha Sil is to listen to the winding of the gears, to think of the unlimited possibilities of what can be, not simply what is, or what was. I know this, but so too do I know what truths our past may hold. My devotion to the Father of Mysteries has been unyielding, spring-loaded even, but still woefully incomplete. I began to ask questions, and was surprised so few knew. Where did our Lord come from? I received a name, but not an answer. \n\nAld Sotha. \n\nI was quick to find my own answers, not within the cautious words of others but in the honest pages of books. My first discovery is that all information I would find was of the Ald Sotha that was, for the town was destroyed long ago. It was the homestead of the minor House Sotha, and how strange to write the word minor with any regard to my Lord's name! But from all my research I can only conclude such, as they are known for no great deeds or any particular skill. An unremarkable town belonging to an unremarkable family, yet somehow the birthplace of the very Father of Mysteries.\n\nAld Sotha was destroyed sometime within the First Era by the Daedric Prince Mehrunes Dagon. There's very little speculation as to why the Prince of Destruction wished to eradicate this town, and I don't believe there needs to be. Why try to piece together the reasoning behind a being of chaos? The result is still the same, and that is the death of everyone living within Ald Sotha. Everyone, that is, but Lord Seht, rescued by Lord Vivec before either of them had obtained true godhood.\n\nVivec's rescue is worth further insight, however. How did Lord Seht survive through the attack? There is no mention of a battle, and from what I have analyzed I can only assume that it was after Dagon's destruction that our Lord Seht was rescued. I can only speculate in that end. If the Tribunal wished for others to know, they would have shared the tale. And you certainly won't see me tugging at one of their sleeves, asking such trivial questions!\n\nAnd, once again, the end result is the same. Lord Seht was rescued, raised by Lord Vivec, and eventually ascended to his rightful place as our Clockwork God. Whatever manner he was saved by Dagon's wrath, it was the fate of the divine gears which move us for him to live, and guide us to reclaim our lost heritage, Tamriel Final."

msgid "By Rosalind Frenrick, Stranded Mage\n\nSo I've been told that my observations have been too … colorful? I suppose is the way I'd put it. I guess after growing up in a world that's just different shades of brown, a bit of color can be confusing. Still, they told me to write my observations, and I'll be damned if I can do that any way but how I know how. So they'll just have to ""analyze"" a bit harder.\n\nI thought I'd write about other places in Clockwork City that I've visited so far. I've talked about the Brass Fortress and the general Radius, but there are some other locations around here that I've been taken to. Some of them seemed a tad more practical than others, but then again, I'm not really sure I can compare my definition of practical with the God of Mystery's.\n\nFirst they took me to the Mnemonic Planisphere. Well, more like we walked by it, because I wasn't allowed to go inside. I was told it was sort of like a storehouse for Sotha Sil's memories. Yeah, you read right. His memories! He's apparently got so many of them that he likes to keep them all organized in a giant building. I tell you, it's almost as big as a castle. And they look like stars? How you turn memories into stars, I'm not sure, but then again I'm not a god.\n\nThe next stop was far more practical of a place, called the Halls of Regulation. Now, I had been wondering where all the fresh water came from, because the rivers and lakes here are filled with oil of all things! Apparently this place somehow cleans it all up. Sure, they tried to explain it to me. Talked about the water cycle and evaporation and all these fancy terms. But hey, it gives me fresh water, so I can't complain even if I barely understand it.\n\nThe inside was a bit less spruced up than I expected. A lot of pipes, a lot of steam, and a lot of factotums. Couldn't help but feel nervous around them all. I was told that they help maintain the Halls of Regulation, all by themselves. I was shocked, since the whole operation sounded a bit high maintenance. Wasn't there an apostle there to give them orders and make sure everything was running smoothly? And then they started talking about Sotha Sil and how he sets everything in ""perfect regulation"" and honestly I started to lose track of the conversation from then on.\n\nWe then went up north to the Everwound Wellspring, which was my favorite stop because they had actual food there! I've never been more happy to eat an apple in my life. After weeks of tasteless gruel, it was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. Ma was right, hunger is truly the best seasoning. And all the plants were green! I never thought I'd miss green as much as I do.\n\nDespite my excitement though, I couldn't help but feel that something was off about the place. The mer running it was nice enough, but after talking to him I could tell he had a few screws loose. All that stress really must have really gotten to him. I suppose he's under a lot of pressure though, especially since he took up the project after Sotha Sil got bored of it. \n \nWell, they're telling me to complete this observation report best I can now. I don't think they need any more observations from me, so I guess this is it. Right, so my overall impression is that Clockwork City … well, it's one of the most dangerous places I've ever set foot in. I can't really believe someone who calls himself a god would really let his followers live here. It's more made for machines than any living creature.\n\nStill, it has an odd beauty about it. The metal leaves in the trees that glitter in the sun are particularly nice. Guess I'll just have to get use to it, since this seems to be a one way trip. No one but Sotha Sil gets to leave Clockwork City. Honestly, I hope I'm the last beef-wit who gets stuck here. I wouldn't wish this life on anyone else."

msgid "Forward by Lector Trivura\n\nAs an ongoing experiment to strengthen the academic integrity of our younger apostles, an initiative of the abstract concept of ""creative thought"" was undergone. As all calculable results continued to prove inconclusive, the project was deemed unsuccessful after a six-week trial. Here is a selection of the poetry that resulted from this initiative, collected for future analysis.\n\n* * *\nAn Ode to a Factotum\n\nThe brass body of your gleaming unit\nThe functions with which you operate\nAll set in a perfect regulation\nWhich you all always gladly state\n\nYou clean our streets and sell our wares\nManage our registries and dead\nYou cook our meals and run our banks\nAll these functions in your head!\n\nBut from where are you created\nBy our all-knowing Lord Seht?\nWhy can we not enter those chambers?\nDid he lock them and forget?\n\nBut we Apostles know the truth\nFor silence gives birth to the intrepid mind\nMysteries are created to be solved\nSo I will unlock the riddles of your kind! \n\n* * *\nThe Wrong Numbers\n\nI know that in a fortnight\nThe market's prices will rise\nAnd I know where to go\nTo find the most sturdy supplies\n\nMy head is filled with numbers\nBut they're all simply wrong\nThey're prices and people and sales\nI know they don't belong\n\nI should think of the numbers\nThat tell of order and sequence\nBut they refuse to stay for long\nAnd they only make me tense!\n\nI want to be an apostle\nWho can make my family proud\nBut all these wrong numbers\nThey're all that I'm allowed\n\n* * *\nA Soaking Bed\n\nMusty sheets on a soaking bed\nThey smell of mold and oil\nMy sister keeps coughing at night\nI can't help her, I'm useless\nI've always just been useless\n\nMagic gathers in my hands one day\nWarm and bright and filled with hope\nAnd each day I study the machines\nTheir cogs and gears and parts\nI learn their secrets eagerly\n\nI'm finally noticed, I'm finally free\nI enter into the world above\nI study and listen and do as I'm told\nA new name for my new life\nI will walk this path before me\n\nWhispers follow me but I do not listen\nI'm now a stranger in my childhood home\nI know it's selfish not to return\nBut the memories linger of that soaking bed\nOf that endless cough I cannot ease \n\n<Note: the last poem in this collection does not follow the required rhyming pattern which poetry entails.
