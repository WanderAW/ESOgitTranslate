msgid "Every Wood Elf knows that the more inward the part, the better it tastes. While other races cook their meat until it is dry and bloodless, and waste entrails and brains, the Wood Elf knows that these parts are the juiciest and therefore the most flavorful.\n\nThe following delicacy is a highlight from the Greenshade region of Valenwood:\n\nJugged Venison\n\n1 Venison Haunch, bloody\nStock\n1 Imported Onion, finely chopped\n\nHang the Haunch for 5 days, until it is tender to the touch.\n\nHeat the haunch in over a medium flame. The oil will give the meat a nice crisp outside. When the meat starts to pop, remove it from the heat.\n\nSeal the hot meat in a vase or jug with the stock and the onion. Let it stand for another fortnight. \n\nTo serve, open the jug and pour the tender haunch onto the table. It is so tender no knife is required. \n\nThis meal will feed a family of four, or a hunter who has gone a few days without killing any prey.\n\nThere are many more such delicacies, often passed down from parent to child."

msgid "When I was young, my parents brought me to the cave where the priests worshiped the nereids. They dedicated me to the temple, so that I might one day become a priest, too.\n\nThere were only three other children in the temple when I was growing up. The others made fun of me until I was ten years old because one of my legs was shorter than the other and I had a limp. \n\nOne day, we were running through the cave (something that was forbidden, but the priests often looked the other way, letting children be children) and I tripped and fell face down into the water. I hit my head and blacked out. The other children were far ahead of me already, so they didn't see.\n\nLater, the priests told me that one of the nereids had lifted me out of the water. I said I didn't remember that happening, but later on, I did recall the feeling of floating and also a kind of terror, like I had seen something I was not supposed to see, something that was too beautiful for mortal eyes.\n\nThe priests instructed us in our relationship to the nereids. We were required to memorize the gifts of the nereids and repeat them back every day:\n\nThe gifts of the nereids are three-fold:\nthe beauty of their form,\nthe sweetness of their singing,\nand protection from harm.\n\nThe older children got to help the priests with the rituals. Meat was brought to the central altar to feed the nereids, and once a year, one priest would go deep into the cave to meditate among their singing. When he would emerge, he would give a prophecy.\n\nWhen he comes of age, each child has a choice to stay and become a priest or to go into exile. After so many years living in the cave, I could not imagine another life, and so I chose the priesthood. But sometimes I long for sunlight and wonder where a different path might have taken me, and what sights I might have seen if I had chosen exile."

msgid "Just like trees grow toward the sun and you can hear different birds singing when the moons are out than when they are not, every Wood Elf born in Valenwood (and indeed, nearly every one born outside of it) knows of the Green Pact.\n\nThe Green Pact is the agreement between the Wood Elves and Y'ffre that has guided our existence from the beginning of the great story.\n\nIts rules are clear. Do not harm the forest. Do not eat anything made from plant life. Eat only meat. When you conquer your enemies, eat their flesh. Do not leave them to rot. Do not kill wastefully. Do not take on the shape of beasts. You are Wood Elves. Your form is sacred. \n\nThis is the Green Pact. In exchange for keeping to this Pact, the forest, which we call the Green, has provided us with ample food and shelter. Y'ffre has given us the limited gift to ask the forest to shape itself to our needs. We have been amply blessed.\n\nBut now, we find ourselves in a new situation. Our new allies—the High Elves and the Khajiit—do not hold to the Green Pact. They live in houses made of thatch and timber. They eat all manner of fruits and berries and drink wine made from grapes. They find the devouring of one's enemies barbaric. \n\nHow are the Wood Elves of Valenwood to accommodate these new allies, while keeping to the Green Pact? It is a question that perplexes many Wood Elves today, especially in the newly-erected city of Marbruk. In the past, we have fought wars over lesser defilement of the Green.\n\nAt the same time, we recognize that at the time of the Dominion's founding, the Green Lady and the Silvenar spoke on behalf of the Wood Elves and the Green Pact. We remember that we have a powerful mouthpiece in the Thalmor, Woodhearth's own Treethane Fariel.\n\nThese are the leaders we should look to in this uncertain time. They have shown us through their actions an example which we can all follow. We must welcome these allies with true Wood Elf hospitality. We must not pick fights with them. We must try not to steal from them (many of them do not appreciate the rite of theft, but that is a subject for another essay). But at the same time, we should not shy away from speaking out in our own interests, and in that of the Green.\n\nBecause of Treethane Fariel's powerful voice, much of the timber and all of the thatch for Marbruk was brought into Valenwood from other parts. For many the fact that so many trees had to be felled to clear space for the city is unforgivable, but Fariel saw that accommodating our allies is the first step to a strong defense of Valenwood against those who would surely destroy it. \n\nQueen Ayrenn's willingness to listen is a sign of her wisdom and respect for the Wood Elf people. We should repay her by being willing to trust her leadership."

msgid "In bright springtime, when the ground is drunk with rainwater and the sun smiles on Valenwood, the Wood Elves travel to the Den of the Eldest, an ancient strangler. There, they offer thanks to Y'ffre for the blooming of yet another spring, and they read the history of their home in the branches of the Eldest.\n\nThen, a great festival is thrown by the Green Pact Bosmer, in celebration of the Springtime and the Eldest. Then Elves celebrate long into the night, drinking and regaling each other with stories of past festivals and pilgrims.\n\nThe tales run both sacred and profane. \n\nThere's the tale of the notorious warlord whose entire army stopped at the Den of the Eldest and went in to pay their respects. When they emerged, they dropped their weapons to the ground and left them where they lay. They never made war again.\n\nBut there is also the tale of the impish Wood Elf who spiked the pilgrims' punch with a powder ground from the dung of timber mammoths, that caused the entire gathering to be troubled by the most foul odors from their backsides. Long into the night they groaned as the stink grew unbearable, until they were all so inured to the smell that their groans turned to bursts of laughter that filled the wood.\n\nThey also tell of the first pilgrims, an old, childless couple who tended the Eldest as their own offspring. They became the first Silvenar and the first Green Lady.\n\nThere are many more tales the pilgrims tell, but few have been written down. The curious would do best to travel to the Eldest in the Springtime and hear the stories and behold the ancient strangler for themselves."

msgid "Since the disappearance of Falinesti, there is no city that completely expresses the character and history of the Wood Elves more than Woodhearth.\n\nSituated on the southwestern shores of Valenwood, Woodhearth had humble beginnings as an Imperial settlement, constructed and maintained by the Emperors in order to facilitate trade with the region's Wood Elf settlements.\n\nThe Wood Elves of the region reacted with a mix of curiosity, friendship, and hostility to the city, which was part thriving port town and part fortress, protecting against the wilds of Valenwood.\n\nSeveral times, hostile Bosmer led assaults against the city's walls. Several times, they managed to bring down sections of the wall with concentrated bursts of powerful destruction magics, only to be driven back by the tenacity of the Imperial forces and their superior equipment.\n\nA peace was eventually struck with the Green Pact Bosmer of Valenwood, and in time a Bosmer settlement sprang up and even overtook the Imperial buildings, as that special connection the Wood Elves have with their forest was invoked to create the treehomes and walkways that are characteristic of Bosmer settlement.\n\nAs the Bosmer became an instrumental force in the Empire, control of Woodhearth was gradually ceded back to autonomous Wood Elf rule. A treethane was established in Woodhearth, and while the parts of the city that had been constructed by the Imperials fell into disrepair, the city as a whole thrived.\n\nWithin a generation, the treethanes of Woodhearth gained a reputation for determined leadership and fair judgment, among both the Wood Elves and their allies.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Treethane of Woodhearth is Fariel, and she governs both as Treethane and as a member of the Thalmor, under Queen Ayrenn of the newly-formed Aldmeri Dominion. Woodhearth continues to be a major port, along with Seaside Sanctuary, in Valenwood, and it is home to members of all races."

msgid "Excerpts from the original four-volume work recorded by Morvas Andrys, who studied the Green Pact Bosmer for three years in the First Era, until he was killed in a mourning war and devoured by the very clan he'd been studying.\n\n… Faniriel was one hundred years old when she consumed the glow-frog of the swamps and it showed her the upside-down tree city of Heartgreen. It was populated by Elves who walked exclusively on their hands….\n\n… Vanirion the Thief, who successfully demanded more than two hundred payments after invoking the Rite of Theft, was once said to have had a vision after climbing into a tree that had appeared in the middle of the forest. \n\nThe tree had purple leaves, and as Vanirion told it, when he sat among them, they gave off the most pleasant fragrance. The sweet scent lulled his mind into a state, and while in this state, he saw a circular grove of trees. The further he went into the grove, the wider the circle became, so that he could never reach its true center.\n\nAs he wandered he met the most beautiful spirit and when she spoke her sentences began with their last word, so that they made circles. ""River. Come, lie with me by the,"" she beckoned.\n\nVanirion only came to his senses when, slumped in a stupor from the powerful odor of the leaves, he fell from the branches of the tree. He survived the fall, but broke his leg, ending his thieving career. He spent the rest of his life searching the forest for the tree with the purple leaves, but never found it.\n…\n\nThen I asked the treethane whether it is right for the Pact Bosmer to say that they ""see"" these visions, and whether it wouldn't be better to say that they ""imagine"" them. It's clear that these strange apparitions of cities and groves and other such wonders don't exist either on Nirn or in Oblivion.\n\nThe treethane took a long drink of whatever foul fermented milk was currently in fashion and looked at his feet and then at the sky. ""You say the world ends at what you can see with your eyes. We say, that is where the world begins."""

msgid "This is a story the Wood Elves of Valenwood tell their children from a very young age.\n\nOnce, there was nothing but formlessness. The land held no shape, the trees did not harden into timber and bark, and the Elves themselves shifted from form to form. This formlessness was called the Ooze.\n\nBut Y'ffre took the Ooze and ordered it. First, she told of the Green, the forest and all the plant life in it. She gave the Green the power to shape itself as it willed, for it was her first tale. \n\nThe Elves were Y'ffre's second tale. As Y'ffre spun the story, the Elves took the form they have today. Y'ffre gave them the power to tell stories, but warned them against trying to shape themselves or the Green. Shifting and the destruction of the forest were forbidden. \n\nInstead, Y'ffre commended the Wood Elves to the Green, so that they might ask the Green to provide them with shelter and a safe passage, and as long as they respected the Green, it would obey. This is called the Green Pact.\n\nFinally, Y'ffre told of all the beasts that crawl on the land or swim in the rivers or fly in the air. These, Y'ffre gave to the Wood Elves as sustenance. They were to eat no plants but consume only meat. Y'ffre also told that no Wood Elf who is struck down by another Wood Elf should be allowed to sink into the ground, but should instead be consumed, like the beasts. This is called the Meat Mandate.\n\nWhen the stories were told, Y'ffre saw that they had a pleasing shape, but some of the Ooze remained. Y'ffre told a final tale then, and gave purpose to the Ooze. \n\nAny Wood Elf that violated the Green Pact, either by shifting or by damaging the Green, would be condemned to return to the formlessness of the Ooze. Their names would be scrubbed from the story Y'ffre is telling and replaced with silence. \n\nThe Wood Elves tell that those who are favored by the Green have the power to release the condemned from the Ooze, but where the condemned go and what form they take once they are released is unknown. \n\nNo one has ever seen the Ooze, or heard the souls trapped in it, or met the one who can relieve the condemned of their punishment. But if you ask a Wood Elf if he thinks the Ooze is ""just a tale,"" he will invariably reply, ""There is no such thing as 'just a tale.'"""

Fadomai said:\n\n""Ja-Kha'jay, to you Fadomai gives the Lattice, for what is steadier than the phases of the moons? Your eternal motions will protect us from Ahnurr's anger."" And the moons left to take their place in the heavens. And Ahnurr growled and shook the Great Darkness, but he could not cross the Lattice.\n\nAnd Fadomai said:\n\n""Nirni, to you Fadomai leaves her greatest gift. You will give birth to many people as Fadomai gave birth today."" When Nirni saw that Azurah had nothing, Nirni left smiling.\n\nAnd all Fadomai's children left except Azurah. And Fadomai said, ""To you, my favored daughter, Fadomai leaves her greatest gift. To you Fadomai leaves her secrets."" And Fadomai told her favored daughter three things.\n\nAnd Fadomai said, ""When Nirni is filled with her children, take one of them and change them. Make the fastest, cleverest, most beautiful people, and call them Khajiit.""\n\nAnd Fadomai said, ""The Khajiit must be the best climbers, for if Masser and Secunda fail, they must climb Khenarthi's breath to set the moons back in their courses.""\n\nAnd Fadomai said, ""The Khajiit must be the best deceivers, for they must always hide their nature from the children of Ahnurr.""\n\nAnd Fadomai said, ""The Khajiit must be the best survivors, for Nirni will be jealous, and she will make the sands harsh and the forests unforgiving, and the Khajiit will always be hungry and at war with Nirni.""\n\nAnd with these words, Fadomai died.\n\nAfter many phases, Nirni came to Lorkhaj and said, ""Lorkhaj, Fadomai told me to give birth to many children, but there is no place for them.""\n\nAnd Lorkhaj said, ""Lorkhaj makes a place for children and Lorkhaj puts you there so you can give birth."" But the Heart of Lorkhaj was filled with the Great Darkness, and Lorkhaj tricked his siblings so that they were forced into this new place with Nirni. And many of Fadomai's children escaped and became the stars. And many of Fadomai's children died to make Nirni's path stable. And the survivors stayed and punished Lorkhaj.\n\nThe children of Fadomai tore out the Heart of Lorkhaj and hid it deep within Nirni. And they said, ""We curse you, noisy Lorkhaj, to walk Nirni for many phases.""\n\nBut Nirni soon forgave Lorkhaj for Nirni could make children. And she filled herself with children, but cried because her favorite children, the forest people, did not know their shape.\n\nAnd Azurah came to her and said, ""Poor Nirni, stop your tears. Azurah makes for you a gift of a new people."" Nirni stopped weeping, and Azurah spoke the First Secret to the Moons and they parted and let Azurah pass. And Azurah took some forest people who were torn between man and beast, and she placed them in the best deserts and forests on Nirni. And Azurah in her wisdom made them of many shapes, one for every purpose. And Azurah named them Khajiit and told them her Second Secret and taught them the value of secrets. And Azurah bound the new Khajiit to the Lunar Lattice, as is proper for Nirni's secret defenders. Then Azurah spoke the Third Secret, and the Moons shone down on the marshes and their light became sugar.\n\nBut Y'ffer heard the First Secret and snuck in behind Azurah. And Y'ffer could not appreciate secrets, and he told Nirni of Azurah's trick. So Nirni made the deserts hot and the sands biting. And Nirni made the forests wet and filled with poisons. And Nirni thanked Y'ffer and let him change the forest people also. And Y'ffer did not have Azurah's subtle wisdom, so Y'ffer made the forest people Elves always and never beasts. And Y'ffer named them Bosmer. And from that moment they were no longer in the same litter as the Khajiit.\n\nAnd because Y'ffer had no appreciation for secrets, he shouted the First Secret across all the heavens with his last breath so that all of Fadomai's children could cross the Lattice. But Azurah, in her wisdom, closed the ears of angry Ahnurr and noisy Lorkhaj so they alone did not hear the word."

You are no longer a mewing kitten and you have learned to keep secrets from Ahnissi, and so Ahnissi tells you.\n\nIn the beginning there were two littermates, Ahnurr and Fadomai. After many phases, Fadomai said to Ahnurr, ""Let us wed and make children to share our happiness.""\n\nAnd they gave birth to Alkosh, the First Cat. And Ahnurr said, ""Alkosh, we give you Time, for what is as fast or as slow as a cat?""\n\nAnd they gave birth to Khenarthi, the Winds. ""Khenarthi, to you we give the sky, for what can fly higher than the wind?""\n\nAnd they gave birth to Magrus, the Cat's Eye. ""Magrus, to you we give the sun, for what is brighter than the eye of a cat?""\n\nAnd they gave birth to Mara, the Mother Cat. ""Mara, you are love, for what is more loving than a mother?""\n\nAnd they gave birth to S'rendarr, the Runt. ""S'rendarr, we give you mercy, for how does a runt survive, except by mercy?""\n\nAnd many phases passed and Ahnurr and Fadomai were happy.\n\nAnd Ahnurr said, ""We should have more children to share our happiness."" And Fadomai agreed. And she gave birth to Hermorah. And she gave birth to Hircine. And she gave birth to Merrunz and Mafala and Sangiin and Sheggorath and many others.\n\nAnd Fadomai said:\n\n""Hermorah, you are the Tides, for who can say whether the moons predict the tides or the tides predict the moons?""\n\n""Hircine, you are the Hungry Cat, for what hunts better than a cat with an empty belly?""\n\n""Merrunz, you are the Ja'Khajiit, for what is more destructive than a kitten?""\n\n""Mafala, you are the Clan Mother, for what is more secretive than the ways of the Clan Mothers?""\n\n""Sangiin, you are the Blood Cat, for who can control the urges of blood?""\n\n""Sheggorath, you are the Skooma Cat, for what is crazier than a cat on skooma?""\n\nAnd Ahnurr said, ""Two litters is enough, for too many children will steal our happiness.""\n\nBut Khenarthi went to Fadomai and said, ""Fadomai-mother, Khenarthi grows lonely so high above the world where not even my brother Alkosh can fly."" Fadomai took pity on her and tricked Ahnurr to make her pregnant again.\n\nAnd Fadomai gave birth to the Moons and their Motions. And she gave birth to Nirni, the majestic sands and lush forests. And she gave birth to Azurah, the dusk and the dawn.\n\nAnd from the beginning, Nirni and Azurah fought for their mother's favor.\n\nAhnurr caught Fadomai while she was still birthing, and he was angry. Ahnurr struck Fadomai and she fled to birth the last of her litter far away in the Great Darkness. Fadomai's children heard what had happened, and they all came to be with her and protect her from Ahnurr's anger.\n\nAnd Fadomai gave birth to Lorkhaj, the last of her litter, in the Great Darkness. And the Heart of Lorkhaj was filled with the Great Darkness. And when he was born, the Great Darkness knew its name and it was Namiira."
