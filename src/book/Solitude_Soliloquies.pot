msgid "Nylkas and the Snowy Sabre Cat\n\nOne day, a young boy named Nylkas went out to do some ice fishing. He walked very far and as he walked, a storm blew up around him. Soon, the snow was falling too heavily for Nyklas to see. He decided to wait out the blizzard in a nearby cave. \n\nWhile he waited, he heard a deep growl, and a snowy sabre cat emerged from the white fog of the storm! It gave a mighty roar and entered the cave. Nylkas was terrified. He had no weapons capable of fighting such a mighty beast. He braced himself for an attack as the cat roared and growled. Then, Nylkas noticed the snowy sabre cat was limping. \n\nWhen he looked closer, he saw a large thorn in the cat's paw. Gathering all of his courage, instead of running from the beast, he moved closer and extracted the thorn. The snowy sabre cat roared in pain, but then relief swept through it as the agony receded. \n\nThe thankful cat licked Nylkas's face and hands, then curled up beside him. Later, when the storm was still too dangerous for Nylkas to venture out, the cat left and brought back game for the two to share in the warmth and safety of the cave. \n\nWhen the storm cleared, Nylkas and the cat emerged from the cave. From then on, they traveled together and remained lifelong friends.\n\n* * *\n\nNever Talk to Strangers\n\nNever talk to Reachmen, they'll eat you in the night.\nNever talk to Easterners, they only want to fight.\n\nDon't say hello to Orcs, they always seem to smell.\nDon't say hello to Redguards, all they do is curse and yell.\n\nNever speak with Elves, they are aloof, and brusk, and very rude.\nNever speak with Imperials, they only want to share their foul mood. \n\nDon't make friends with Argonians, they're cold and wet and slimy.\nDon't make friends with Khajiit, they'll take anything that's shiny. \n\nNever talk to Bretons, they're just as bad as Elves.\nNever talk to strangers, we Nords must keep to ourselves!\n\n* * *\nThe Jarl's New Robes\n\nThere once was a jarl who was incredibly vain. He loved his fine clothes more than anything in the world, and often neglected his duties in favor of finding and purchasing new outfits. \n\nOne day, two skeeving criminals calling themselves tailors made their way to the hold. They told the jarl that they could weave him exquisite clothes in the most beautiful colors and designs. The clothes they made were so spectacular, in fact, that they would be invisible to both fools and anyone unfit for the position they held. \n\nThe jarl insisted the tailors make him a fine outfit as quickly as possible, one fit for a jarl! He paid them handsomely and the two of them set to work. In reality, the tailors did no work at all! They asked for splendid materials like silverweave and spidersilk, but merely took them for themselves and continued to pretend they were hard at work. They asked for sweetrolls and pies, and slept in lavish beds in the jarl's longhouse while they pretended to toil away. \n\nEventually, the jarl asked how his clothes were coming along. He sent his housecarl to check on the tailors. When the housecarl arrived, the tailors were working at empty tables! She wondered how this could be possible. The tailors asked if she liked the clothes, and if she thought the colors were beautiful. The housecarl remembered that only fools and those unfit for their post could not see the clothes. She did not think herself either, so she lied and told the tailors the clothes were the most beautiful she'd ever seen. She reported back to the jarl and assured him the clothes were fine indeed. The jarl sent the court mage and his steward to check as well, and the two of them saw nothing either, but pretended they did. They assured the jarl the outfit was spectacular. \n\nSoon, the tailors announced their work was complete. The jarl went to see for himself. When he arrived, he was shocked to find he saw nothing at all! The tailors displayed the empty table and asked him if he was pleased with the result. Did he like the design? The breathtaking colors? The jarl, too afraid to admit the truth, told the tailors he adored the clothes and would wear them straight away.\n\nHe undressed and let the tailors pantomime the act of putting his new clothes on him. They were meticulous and even secured the imaginary robe around his neck before they finished. Then, he called in his retinue to admire his new clothes. Each of them were surprised to see the jarl standing as naked as a horker before them, but all of them were too ashamed to admit this. Instead, they fawned over his clothes and all agreed they were exquisite. \n\nThe tailors insisted the jarl go out into the hold and display his new clothes for his people. So, he did just that. He proudly marched down the road as his people gathered. They all saw he was naked, but were too afraid to admit it, lest they be called fools or worse. \n\nIt wasn't until a child stepped out of the crowd and boldly exclaimed, ""The jarl is naked!"" did the crowd stop pretending. They began to laugh and point. The jarl, mortified, ran back to his longhouse … but the two so-called tailors were already gone!\n\nSo the jarl instead punished his housecarl, court mage, and steward for their failure to stop the jarl from making a fool of himself. He chopped off their heads personally—and with a very real and solid axe."

msgid "At the behest of my correspondents, I have made great efforts to restrict the contents of my travel journal so as to not lose my reader's interest. In touring the holds of Skyrim, I was unsure through what lens I should present my travels. After a sumptuous meal at the start of my journey, I knew it must be food—and thus, my catalog of Skyrim's cheeses was born.\n\nThe land is as diverse as are its climes, and both mean the panoply of cheeses are vast. Again, for the sake of brevity, I sought to capture only the most noteworthy cheese from each hold I visited.\n\nB.\n\nGreenedge\nGreenedge is a festive cheese, which I found to be rather peculiar due to the dour reputation of Hjaalmarch (and, in particular, its capital of Morthal). The name of the cheese, derived from the charming ""baskets""—for there can be no other word for it—of rushes plucked from nearby bogs and woven together, speaks to both its visual appeal and the process of its creation. The cheese is brined and pressed within these baskets, with the latter process imbuing the rind of the normally cream-colored cheese with a verdant hue.\n\nThe way the locals eat the cheese is also curious. The consumption of Greenedge, customarily served at the end of feasts, has become something of a spectacle. Young hunters make a game of holding the rush-encased cheese over a flaming torch until its casing burns away and the cheese transforms into a near-molten state. Observers laud veterans of this ordeal for the showmanship they add to this feat, dancing the highly combustible cheese along the torch flame without pausing too long, lest the cheese blacken or their fingers burn.\n\nThus prepared, they flip the hot cheese onto a table and guests immediately plunge bread—or, occasionally, sliced apples—into the melted goodness. Children find particular joy in the activity, for at this point the cheese's secret contents are revealed—dried fruits and berries, and (in wealthier households) a single amber plum. The lucky eater that spears the plum before all others is named king of the feast.\n\nSolitude Eidar\nThe greatest of the cheeses in Skyrim, in my opinion, is Solitude Eidar. Not because of its flavor or bizarre nature, but for its extreme rarity. Solitude Eidar is, as the name implies, an eidar cheese, being aged and inoculated with the spores of some fungus. And, like eidar, it is aged underground, in this case in the vaults below the ancient city. But here the similarities to regular eidar end.\n\nFirst the source. Solitude Eidar is a masterful translation of Western Skyrim's staunch traditionalism to the practice of cheese-making, and this starts with the milk. Only cows that belonged to the herd of Jarl Svartr, first king of Western Skyrim, can provide milk for the cheese. The royal herd, descended from these cows, is maintained by loyal retainers. Milk arrives regularly in Solitude, where it undergoes inspection by a royal cheesemonger—a hereditary office within the Blue Palace. This connoisseur of dairy has exacting standards for the milk he inspects—indeed, for I have seen him—and only one out of every dozen barrels is deemed fit for the making of Solitude Eidar. The milk curdles in a precise fashion, using a series of hourglasses custom-made for the purpose. Lastly, they add a crumb of cheese from the previous batch into the next one—thus creating an unbroken chain of eidar dating back generations.\n\nThe result is, as I am led to understand, a cheese that has the precise appearance, aroma, and taste as it had in Svartr's day. I was skeptical until I was given two pieces of cheese, one preserved from decades ago, and one only recently cut from its rind. I was instructed to sample both and see if I could tell the difference.\n\nI could not, and I wept."

msgid """It's poison. I'd stake my reputation on it,"" Investigator Vale said.\n\n""I swear, he didn't have a thing to drink all night! Didn't see him eat anything either,"" the bartender of the Lonely Troll said while he nervously wrung a towel through his hands, ""But he looked scared. Jumpy.""\n\nInvestigator Vale stood over the body of the male Nord that lay on the floor of the once-bustling tavern. Much of the place cleared out when the man dropped dead in the middle of the evening rush, but a few brave patrons continued to drink in corners out of sight of the corpse. \n\nThe average Nord's commitment to mead was something to be respected, Vale thought.\n\n""Strange. What was he doing here if he wasn't eating or drinking?"" Vale mused aloud, ""And how in the world was he poisoned?""\n\nThe attractive guard captain folded her arms across her chest and frowned, ""A sober Nord in a tavern. That always spells trouble.""\n\nVale smiled, ""My thoughts exactly, Captain Aeja.""\n\nWithout so much as a warning, Investigator Vale pushed herself away from the bar and made her way toward the tavern's recesses. Captain Aeja hurried along behind her. She was much taller but found it hard to keep up with the quick, curvaceous private investigator as she navigated the small pockets of people left inside the tavern.\n\n""Investigator, where are you going?""\n\nVale stopped in front of a table tucked into the back of the tavern. There, a handsome man sat by himself, save for a pet scorpion crawling on his shoulder. As the two women approached, the man grinned widely and gestured with his sloshing tankard. \n\n""Hail, ladies! To what do I owe the honor of having two lovely women approach my table?""\n\nInvestigator Vale slid into the seat next to him with a vulpine smile, ""I noticed your tankard is full.""\n\nThe man's expression did not falter, as Vale expected it to. He was either a very good actor, or her hunch was wrong. But her hunches were never wrong.\n\n""Are you interested in helping me with that?"" the man asked with a waggle of his brow.\n\nVale saw Captain Aeja stiffen beside her, her hand clenching the pommel of her sheathed blade. The young captain was rather alluring when she got all protective, Vale thought. But there would be time for that later.\n\n""No, merely curious about the reason for your hesitation,"" she said with a smile.\n\nThe man adjusted the sleeve of his robe with a subtle movement, ""Sometimes a man prefers to savor his drink. Is that a crime?""\n\n""Not at all,"" Vale said coolly, ""Unless, of course, you're staying sober to watch the fruits of your labor play out in a crowded tavern.""\n\n""That's quite a bold accusation,"" he scoffed, ""You can't walk around accusing anyone who isn't drunk of being a murderer.""\n\n""True. Though I can accuse someone with a deadly azure scorpion of being a murderer.""\n\n""Zaleya would never hurt anyone,"" the man protested.\n\n""Not of her own volition, surely,"" Vale said, ""But that particular breed has been domesticated. She'd take orders from her master if instructed.""\n\nThe man narrowed his eyes, ""You have no proof!""\n\nThe Investigator held out a delicate hand. Her eyes flashed dangerously. ""Then let her sting me.""\n\nCaptain Aeja balked, ""What? Investigator, don't!""\n\n""To kill a man of that size, lovely Zaleya would have had to expend much, if not all, of her venom. It will take time for her to replenish that. Therefore, if I'm correct, I should be completely safe.""\n\nThe captain eyed the plucky investigator warily, but finally turned her gaze on the man. ""Well? Let's see it then.""\n\nThe man's expression didn't change, but Investigator Vale saw fury spark in his eyes. A muscle in his jaw jumped as he picked up the scorpion and placed it in the investigator's waiting hand. He made a soft clicking noise with his tongue, and the scorpion's tail plunged into Vale's palm.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, the man jumped up and tried to run. Investigator Vale, who stood calmly cradling the scorpion, stepped deftly to the side to give Captain Aeja room. The tall guard shoved the man back into his seat so hard the chair tipped backward and spilled him onto the floor. Before he could scramble back to his feet, Captain Aeja drew her sword and laid it at the base of his throat.\n\nInvestigator Vale smiled and stroked the scorpion with a delicate finger, ""My, you are full of spirit, aren't you, Zaleya?""\n\n""Investigator, are you all right?"" the captain asked.\n\n""Never better,"" Vale replied.\n\n""What kind of woman are you?"" the man choked, ""You were supposed to fall to your knees in pain!""\n\n""I only fall to my knees for very specific occasions, my dear,"" Vale said smugly, and then let the scorpion crawl from her hand and onto the table, ""Speaking of which, Captain Aeja, once we're finished here I'd love to buy you a drink.""\n\nThe attractive guard blushed and tried unsuccessfully to conceal a smile, ""As you say, Investigator.""\n\n""Though,"" Investigator Vale said with a wink, ""Perhaps we'll pick a different tavern."""

msgid "Right, you sod. I'm stuck in my room at the guild hall with a broken ankle, and the healer says it'll be a miracle if I'm walking again this side of six weeks. The hall steward says it's good to take the time to put word to parchment, so the younger members can get the benefits of my ""wisdom."" Drinking seems like a better way to waste the hours, but it's the hall steward who's putting me up for my convalescence.\n\nSo read well. Any ponce with a dirk can gut a few sabre cats in the foothills of Kilkreath. But the real work, that's in the pits and dark corners of Western Skyrim. I've knocked about them enough to know what's what, so if you want a chance of seeing daylight after delving in these places, keep reading.\n\nSHADOWGREEN\nAny recruit might think a place so close to Solitude won't be that dangerous. Wrong. There's a gods-damned menagerie of beasts in this place, ready to claw out your eyes and eat your liver. And that's just the start—rivers of fire ribbon the place! Saw a healer get the air choked from her lungs just by standing too close to the stuff. And while you're minding the heat, you need to contend with the frozen wind that blows in from the Sea of Ghosts. It can turn your fingers black if you don't wrap them tightly. Try fending off a hungry bear with a handful of frostbitten fingers, I dare you!\n\nThere's worse rumors lately. Hagravens, the prickly wretches, were spotted setting up roosts in the place. Calling all sorts of nastier things to their side, I reckon. Gods know what they want.\n\nDRAGONHOME\nFirst, let me clear the air. There's not a single damn Dragon in the place. I'm sick of every Svyne, Bor and Oda thinking they're going to slay a Dragon and become a hero of legend. You want to do that, travel to Elsweyr!\n\nWhat this place does have is draugr—enough to give any chapter of the guild pause. The Dragon Cult really knew how to fit a legion into a few musty halls, I'll give them that. And where you don't find draugr, you'll find cultists barmy enough to think it's smart to worship Dragons. Think they're back in the days of old, they do! It's got the other charms of barrows, too—traps, sepulchers that suddenly burst open, and on top of that, a fall that will kill you if you don't watch your footing. So, mind the heights!\n\nFROZEN COAST\nDrowning is a terrible way to die. There's a lot of ways a berk can die in our line of work, but drowning is just about the worst of them in my book. So, imagine you're standing on a shelf of slick ice, fighting off a Sea Giant, and you take a misstep and plunge into water colder than Naemira's teat. You ain't jumping right out of that. The cold saps the air from your lungs straight away. Whatever  strength you had to pull your armored arse out of the deep flutters away. And then you sink.\n\nThat's the bad part. The worse part is the clan of Sea Giants that decided these rocks might be a good spot to sit for a spell and sow some mayhem. You might think I'm talking about the doddering, fur-clad sods you see in in the wilds. No. Sea Giants are smart. They're also mean, and they'll happily take the time to make your death as painful as possible—just for the fun of it. And they don't make cheese from mammoth milk—at least as far as I can tell.\n\nCHILLWIND DEPTHS\nIt's a cave. Low light, low ceiling. Until recently, there wasn't much in there to be worried about. Some Reachfolk hiding out, maybe. Or a stray necromancer or two. Nothing the guild couldn't handle. But some creatures have set up homes in these tunnels, creatures I haven't seen before. Like goblins, only not. \n\nPale things with nasty armor, strong enough to pull a full-grown Orc screaming into the black tunnels. I took a job to check it out, and barely got two chambers in before these things attacked me.\nThere's some kind of bugs they use—massive, armored things, with mandibles like steel traps. They'll bite right through chain mail, and I wouldn't be surprised if venom dripped from those jaws.\n\nLABYRINTHIAN\nAny smart berk can make their way into and out of the delves above without too much fear of losing hide nor hair. But only an idiot goes into Labyrinthian without a small army. I don't care if a scholar's only got the coin to pay for one guard, it ain't worth the gold. There's big blokes in the upper levels of the place, and plenty of meaner things in the caverns below. Word of warning: don't go too deep. Plenty go down that don't come back up."

She avoided venturing into it as much as she could. \n\nOne day, however, she left her cozy tree to search for food. It was a cold, blustery day. Scared Little Snow Moth did not mind the snow, or the chilly wind against her wings, but she feared what the blizzard concealed. She did not want to run into a monster.\n\nAs she flew, she saw a light in the snow. She thought it might be the eye of some horrible monster, but when she got closer, she realized it was just a tiny torchbug. \n\nMean Old Torchbug had grown tired of his adventures in the kwama mine. He traveled far until he reached a land covered in snow and ice, but now he was quite bored. Then, he spotted the Scared Little Snow Moth. A wicked thought popped into his head as he watched her float among the glittering snowflakes. \n\n""Hello, Little Snow Moth,"" Torchbug called out, his voice popping like flames in the cold, ""What are you doing out in this storm?""\n\n""I'm hungry,"" Scared Little Snow Moth said in small voice, ""I don't want any trouble.""\n\n""If you're hungry, you should explore that cave over there,"" Torchbug sang, ""It's full of delicious food!""\n\nScared Little Snow Moth spotted the cave. It didn't look very safe. In fact, it looked quite dangerous! She knew of a place that was much less frightening where she could gather food more safely.\n\n""Come now,"" sang Torchbug, ""I'll stay nearby and make sure nothing happens to you. Don't you want a tasty feast?""\n\nScared Little Snow Moth thought about this for a long moment. She was frightened, but not foolish. \n\n""I don't believe you,"" she said, ""You just want me to go into that cave and get hurt.""\n\n""Not hurt, just eaten! I think I would like to see someone make a feast out of you, Little Snow Moth.""\n\n""Not today, Torchbug,"" Scared Little Snow Moth said in a slightly bigger voice than before, ""I am much too frightened to be eaten.""\n\n""If you insist, Little Snow Moth. Goodbye,"" Torchbug sang. \n\nAnd Scared Little Snow Moth flew as fast as her wings would carry her through the snow, leaving Torchbug behind. She did not speak to anyone else. As soon as she gathered her food, she raced back to her cozy tree and huddled up against the bark where she knew she was safe."

msgid "By Imperial Surveyor Buntara Gravius\n\nMy guide to the reclusive kingdom of Western Skyrim continues, with a look at the region's southernmost hold. \n\nKARTHALD, which did not exist when this guide was first written, lies to the south of Haafingar and to the west of Hjaalmarch. This territory had, until half a decade ago, been nominally in the control of the Reach. However Nords and Reachfolk have hotly contested the area's ownership since time immemorial, and none can definitively claim proprietorship of the area. The hold was established recently, though Nords have lived in the area for centuries. Karthald occupies a land of flinty ridges and sweeping bluffs, as well as pine forest. The pocketed landscape hides many wondrous sites, as well as many potential dangers.\n \nKarthwatch is the seat of power within the hold. The jarl and its people are stewards of Western Skyrim's southern border, and their charge is to stand fast against the encroaching Reachmen. Though hospitable to travelers, the people of Karthwatch have little to offer in the way of amenities, and they make no excuse for any discomfort that visitors might endure while staying in the settlement. Though technically Karthwatch is a town, its inhabitants very much view it as a fortification.\n\nMor Khazgur, an Orc mining settlement, sits in the mountains on the western border of the hold. Visitors to the clan grounds are advised to avoid referring to the lands within and around the camp as belonging to Karthald, though it is a legal and logical truth. The Orcs prefer to think of their territory as a sovereign outpost of Wrothgar, subject to the rules and customs of Orc-kind. To that end, visitors to the area are advised to be well aware of Orcish protocol and behavior, at the risk of upsetting their hosts (and having their persons injured). That said, the Orcs of Mor Khazgur are no different from their kin in Orsinium—spirited, enthusiastic, and eager for friendship. \n\nAuthor's Note: As with all of Skyrim's holds, Karthald features caverns and caves where the safety of travelers is by no means guaranteed. Given the author's desire to keep her readers safe, she has elected to excise reference to these dangerous locales from this edition."

msgid "By Imperial Surveyor Buntara Gravius\n\nMy guide to the reclusive kingdom of Western Skyrim continues, with a look at the region's easternmost hold. \n\nHJAALMARCH, drawing its name from Western Skyrim's River Hjaal, stands as the largest of the kingdom's holds. The Drajkmyr, an immense saltwater marsh formed by the estuaries of the River Karth and River Hjaal, dominate the region. This largely uninhabited marshland, frequently shrouded in an eerie mist, features a proliferation of the sinisterly reputed Deathbell flower. Though exploring the wetlands can be difficult, earnest travelers can find much to discover and enjoy in the hold.\n\nMorthal, a lumber town in the southeast of the Drajkmyr, serves as the jarl's seat of power in the hold. The houses are built on pylons by necessity, and connected by docks to provide safe passage over the mire. Structures here are a prime example of Nordic rough-hewn architecture. The people of Morthal can be gracious hosts, if unaccustomed to travelers given the arduous routes to and from the town. Many make their living from the saltmarsh, fishing and trapping creatures for meat and hide. In warmer seasons, timber is sent to Solitude's docks on pole-driven barges. Morthal is considered an essential destination due to its neighboring barrow, one of the few still safe for unarmed travelers to explore.\n\nThe ice shelves abutting the Sea of Ghosts are a popular spot for explorers and travelers, though they require proper outfitting to traverse safely. The ice has trapped numerous ships and vessels across the ages, and many of these wrecks offer collectors and hobbyists an opportunity to uncover trinkets or souvenirs from a bygone age. As with most of Skyrim's wilderness, hiring a well-informed guide is a practical necessity for those seeking to visit these floes.\n\nLabyrinthian, an enormous barrow found in the foothills of southeastern Hjaalmarch, stands as a dangerous curiosity. Scholars know this complex to be the ruins of the city of Bromjunaar, a capital of the Dragon Cult in Skyrim's ancient, sordid past. Rumor speaks of an intricate and maddening maze housed within these ruins, though its existence has never been confirmed by a reputable source. Insofar as Labyrinthian is a notable landmark within Hjaalmarch, it is included in this list, though it is frequently a site occupied by foul creatures and black-hearted folk. So, best to avoid it.\n\nAuthor's Note: As with all of Skyrim's holds, Hjaalmarch contains additional caves and other locations where the safety of travelers is by no means guaranteed. Given the author's desire to keep her readers safe, she has elected to excise reference to these dangerous locales from this edition."

msgid "This continuation of my travel journal, which focuses on the cheeses prevalent in the holds of Skyrim, explores a land and its cuisine that is as diverse as the multitude of flavors that danced across my tongue. Again, for the sake of brevity, I sought to capture only the most noteworthy cheese from each hold I visited.\n\nB.\n\nRiftwash\nOnce reserved exclusively for the jarls of Riften, riftwash is a cheese with a glassy, violet-black exterior, which belies a pallid and crumbly core. As a goat's milk cheese, it is uncommon in the more temperate of Skyrim's climes. Pressed to remove much of the water within the cheese, unlike the goat's milk cheeses of Stormhaven, which the Bretons prize for moistness, riftwash is comparably dry.\n\nRumor says that the cheesemakers bathe wheels of riftwash in the muddy waters of Lake Honrich, which results in its dark hue.This is, of course, an outrageous falsehood. In truth, the cheese is washed several times in Riften's famous blackberry mead before being shrouded in wax which has been dyed with blackberry must, a by-product of the city's burgeoning meadworks. \n\nBarrowost\nThe people of Falkreath seem to earnestly appreciate their hold's longstanding association with battle and death. The shops, and indeed many families, draw their names and personal heraldry from the seemingly boundless graveyard that abuts the city. It is no surprise, perhaps, that one of Falkreath's most reputed cheeses relies on the dead for a key part of its production.\n\nBarrowost, or more commonly, barrow-cheese, much resembles the common eidar cheese found throughout the holds of Skyrim. Whereas eidar cheese is aged in cellars or caverns, however, barrowost is exclusively aged in barrows—the crumbling, draugr-infested tombs of Skyrim's dark past. Be it the stagnant air, the endlessly sweating stone, or the dark magic within its walls, the cheese gains an intense earthy sweetness, punctuated with sharp notes I find impossible to resist.\n\nAs an aside, I learned that Falkreath still practices an ancient Nord custom, the ""grave curd."" According to the practice, a fresh farmer's cheese is interred atop a loved one's coffin. Every year, on the anniversary of the departed's death, the grave curd is exhumed and a fifth of it is consumed by the bereaved. Many would balk at eating from a grave, but gods help me—the piece that was served to me was delicious!"

msgid "By Amadri Drevin, student.\n\nThere are many different thoughts on the pronunciation of Dwemer words. I just sat through a discussion with my master and several other scholars. As always, ""learned"" scholars disagree. A lot. They also love the sound of their own voices, especially when it comes to Dwarven nomenclature.  \n\nAfter sifting through the Dwemer words passed down to us through history, most notably the names of places, and sitting through that long-winded scholarly review, I have distilled the knowledge to provide a guide on Dwemer pronunciation for other aspiring Dwarven scholars:\n\nHow to pronounce Dwemer words:\n	- First, inhale deeply\n	- Second, drink a full glass of mead or Cyrodilic brandy, whichever you prefer.\n	- Inhale deeply again\n	- Put four to seven smooth rounded pebbles in your mouth\n	- Attempt to say any word you like, but leave out most of the vowels and add extra consonants\n	- Emphasize either the third or fourth syllable in an exaggerated manner (even if the word has only two syllables)\n\nCongratulations, you have successfully pronounced a Dwemer word."

msgid "I continue my travel journal through the holds of Skyrim with this look at the cheeses of the Reach and the Pale. Again, for the sake of brevity, I sought to capture only the most noteworthy cheese from each hold I visited.\n\nB.\n\nDoe's Ire\nKarthald and the Reach's rocky passes and sheer cliffs make goats the only practical animal for herders to keep. As such, the area's principal cheese is made with goat's milk and flavored with berries from the seemingly ubiquitous juniper bushes that grow across the region. Most curious about this cheese is not its flavor—which I find cloyingly salty—but, rather, its strange role in the politics of the area. The Reach often gives rise to rebellious and ambitious rulers. They live under the armed watch of soldiers from Solitude or Evermore, who often do what they must to suppress the lust for conquest that seems to beat in the heart of every Reachfolk.\n\nIn tramping down these ambitions, many of the Reach's traditions become surpressed—save for the making and eating of doe's ire cheese, so named because a goat doe's milk is curdled in the stomach of its own offspring to produce the cheese. The cheese is eaten on feast days dear to the Reach, in stark disobedience of those that would suppress the Reachfolk's spirit. Some say the cheese's salty profile comes from the tears of the doe, whose milk is soured in its offspring's carcass. Patriots of the Reach say the cheese is salty to remind those who eat it of the sorrows that befell the Reach, punishment for unfulfilled destiny. \n\nBjenost\nBjenost is most curious among Skyrim's offerings, being more of a ""cheese of cheeses"" than a cheese in and of itself. It is eaten almost exclusively by the people of the Pale, who do so to mark the end of winter and the return of spring.\n\nAs with many cheeses, bjenost almost certainly originated among the poor of the hold, though now high and low tables alike enjoy this delicacy. Made in the style of many of the hold's sausages, stuffed into the intestines of a slaughtered pig. As the thaw approaches, they take the rinds and crumbs of cheeses that were consumed over the course of the long, dark winter, soak them in a tun of ale (a brown slurry of yeast and malt, the kind of drink that can be a meal in and of itself), then stuff it all inside the intestines. The bjenost is then hung to dry, to be taken down only at the High Spring Fest. It is sliced into golden disks, said to resemble the sun in springtime and enjoyed by all."

msgid "I continue my travel journal through the holds of Skyrim with this look at the cheeses of the east: Whiterun, Winterhold, and Eastmarch. Again, for the sake of brevity, I sought to capture only the most noteworthy cheese from each hold I visited.\n\nB.\n\nAld Umber\nOne of the most decadent cheeses of Skyrim hails from the kingdom's breadbasket, the fertile and expansive Whiterun Hold. Though I have to admit, for all of the luxuriousness that one feels when eating ald umber, it is neither the most complex nor challenging cheese I've encountered on my tour of the holds.  \n\nMany assume by the name alone that ald umber is an extremely aged cheese, in the tradition of eidar. That cannot be farther from the truth. Rather, the name is a sign of how long this cheese has been a part of Whiterun's culinary landscape. I hazard to even call it a cheese, frankly, for its method of production is unlike any other cheese I know. They collect whey from curd-pressings, and rather than discard it, they combine it with cream. This mixture is boiled in a wide, shallow pot over the course of many hours. The liquid becomes solid over time, and in doing so, it adopts a pale brown color and caramel-like aroma, hence the name ""umber."" \n\nGhostflesh\nThe people of Winterhold, at least those who don't practice magic within the hold's illustrious college, are a simple folk that eke out a living by working the Sea of Ghosts. There is little pasture for grazing, and the bitter winds coming off the sea are oft as not to see a herd of cattle stricken with ague. Both cow and goat's milk are in short supply. What little is at hand is made into a fresh, soft farmer's cheese. But despite the humble circumstances, the people of Winterhold make one of the most delicious cheese dishes I've ever experienced. \n\nThe elderly and the children of the hold, too young to brave the waters of the Sea of Ghosts, spend the day collecting seaweed, which they dry for several weeks. The simple farmer's cheese is smoked over a pile of burning seaweed, imbuing it with an aroma of the sea. It is then—and this is the most marvelous part—baked, being wrapped in a pastry that is composed of flour and horker suet. This permits the brave fisherfolk to eat while working the sea, where often they can only spare one hand at a time.\n\nWhen freshly baked, the molten innards of these dumplings steam and crackle, while the crust remains flaky and light, as though one were biting into the flesh of an ethereal creature. They are best enjoyed after walking several hours on Winterhold's frozen shore, chased by the onset of dusk.\n\nMammoth Cheese\nThe good people of Eastmarch, who proved such kind hosts to me on my travels, will likely never forgive me for glossing over their contributions to the art of cheese making. But given the number of Giant camps within the hold's borders, I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to wax on the singular dish mentioned in every bedside fable about Skyrim—mammoth cheese, the single commodity produced by Giants.\n\nIt is cheese of a primitive sort. They fill the stomach of a young mammoth to near-bursting with the milk of a Giant's mammoth herd. The milk curdles and the resulting curds are placed into hide sacks and wrung to release moisture. What remains is a paste-like mammoth cheese—unappetizing to any connoisseur and not worth the risk to acquire.\n\nWhat is worth remarking on, however, is the strange behavior of Giants that graze their herds near the sulfurous pools in the countryside. They take their sacks of curds and boil them in the mineral-rich waters, giving the cheese a pleasing and complex bouquet, that I can only liken to ash used in glassmaking, called potash. Once this is done, the mammoth cheese becomes something worthy of the finest tables in all the land."

msgid "Mother asked me to go speak with Wilgin today. His sawmill keeps the town alive in a lot of ways, even during the times when it's bitter cold out. She believes I should learn more about how his operation works. This is all part of her belief that I'll take over her duties when I'm older. Honestly, I don't think she even wants that. Not in her heart. It must be coming from father.\n\nAnyway, Wilgin's nice enough. Maybe he'll let me use that big saw to cut up some logs.\n\n* * *\nWent to see Havil at his farm. I always try to find some excuse to leave town and explore the woods. Father warns about wolves and trolls or whatever, but they never bother me. Havil lets me play with the animals. And the other farmhands like to make me laugh by telling bawdy stories. It's nice there. Far enough away from Morthal that I feel like I'm my own person. It's the same reason I visit Old Mjolen—she treats me like a friend and not the jarl's daughter.\n\n* * *\nAn amazing person just rode into town! I watched her from my window as she went into the tavern. She only carried a backpack and strange staff, so I have no idea why she's here. Nobody ever comes to Morthal unless for a job. I guess she got a room because she didn't come out. I absolutely need to know more.\n\n* * *\nHer name is Maxten. I waited at the tavern all day hoping to see her. Tried to act occupied, like I was writing a poem or something, so Eyga didn't grow suspicious. But I don't think it worked. \n\nFinally, I saw her come downstairs and immediately invited her to sit with me. Probably I came across as overly eager. I just don't have a lot of experience with this sort of thing. Maxten stared at me for a bit, probably trying to work out why I was acting friendly. Then she sat down and ordered some dinner. Or breakfast I guess—she mentioned sleeping all day.\n\nShe's fascinating! Traveled all over the world, learning more about her research. She didn't go into detail, so I didn't pry. We got along rather well. And, I have to say, she's rather beautiful.\n\n* * *\nMother caught me sneaking out of the house. Or, I suppose, she caught me sneaking back in. I joined Maxten on one of her trips to find the source of energy she's tracking. At first, I worried when she admitted she studies necromancy—we all know the stories about the dangers of such magic. But she's so careful and rigorous about it. I see now that it can be a legitimate area of knowledge, like anything else. It's cute how focused she becomes when testing some dirt or whatever.\n\nAs we walked through the darkness, I held her hand. There was a moment where I felt so overwhelmed by emotion that I stopped and kissed her. It was warm. Comforting. I want to feel that way again and again.\n\nLike I said, mother caught me when I returned. She acted stern about my keeping secrets, but I could tell she was just worried. We ended up talking about Maxten, though I left out the part about necromancy. She surprised me by offering encouragement. Morthal doesn't offer much in the way of variety of life experience. And mother had a much fuller life before she came here. I think she wants the same for me.\n\n* * *\nFinally, after so much time searching, Maxten tracked down what she's been looking for. She wants me to join her at the old ruins tonight. I'll need to sneak out again, despite Mother's direct wishes. But it's worth it to see my Maxten achieve her goal.\n\nPeople around town have started to be suspicious of her. It's been months and she hardly speaks to anyone but me. She's just private. They're all good people, just unused to outsiders. Especially mages like Maxten.\n\nHopefully she will stay even once she's done this ritual. I can't imagine my life without her anymore."

msgid "The name is whispered in certain corners of Skyrim. It is spoken of in roadside taverns and trapper camps. Sometimes the word is pronounced with awed reverence. Others spit it out like a terrible curse. Blackreach.\n\nIndeed, Blackreach features prominently in many folktales and superstitions in Tamriel's forlorn north. Many tricksters enrich themselves by selling precious ores and gemstones said to come from the legendary place, while parents frighten children and urge them to behave with threats that the monsters will drag them to Blackreach if they aren't good.\n\nSo, what is Blackreach, you ask? A legend, a ghost, a fable? Blackreach is all these things and more. According to the Nords, it's the great expanse that stretches below the ice and snow. An underground land that once belonged to the Dwarves and now sits empty—or worse, has been filled by all manner of myth and monster.\n\nThese stories, as with all tales that originate with the common folk, must be viewed with a skeptic's gaze. The lesser-minded often turn to tales of the fabulous and terrifying to justify and rationalize the greater mysteries or tragedies of life. A loved one suddenly falls ill and dies? Poisoned, doubtless, by a miasma seeping up from Blackreach. An enemy enjoys a sudden windfall? He's made a dark bargain with Blackreach's spirits. \n\nOf course, it would be close-minded to simply write off all tales of Blackreach as baseless and without merit. Skyrim's territories teem with subterranean caverns—one need only speak to any of the dozens of adventurers who make their livings delving into such depths. It would take little effort for a peasant to believe these caverns extend deeper, far beyond the ken of any adventurer, into a morass of passages and tunnels lost to time and light. For that is the true reality of Blackreach: a few odd caves and the wild imaginings of some half-drunk farmer.\n\nDo not think me too disdainful, reader, for I do respect this hypothetical lout. From his mind has sprung forth an idea so compelling that it remains a topic of conversation in tavern halls, campfires, and back-alley hovels to this day. I applaud their imagination!"

msgid "By Inky-Claws\n\nWould that my shell-siblings had come with me on this journey to the vast north! Though on some days, I do not blame them for choosing to remain in the tepid mud-baths of Gideon. Western Skyrim and its dryskins are not accustomed to travelers from Black Marsh, it seems. However, they appear more receptive to my kind than they are to their eastern neighbors. ""Milk-drinkers,"" they say, and spit on the ground. What a waste of perfectly good rheum!\n\nI assumed Western Skyrim was nothing but ice and rock. But there is much variety to be found in the different ""holds,"" as they call them, even if their names are odious to those without round tongues. \n\nHaafingar serves as the skull in the headdress, if Western Skyrim might be thought of as such finery. Icy winds from the Sea of Ghosts blasts the land, and much of it is barren coastline. But there is a safe harbor where the hold's rivers meet the sea, and astride it sits the city of Solitude. If Haafingar is the skull in the headdress, then Solitude is the uxul-bean in the skull! A Nord's idea of a metropolis to be sure, with little in the way of flowers or scent-worms or warm mud springs to relax in. Still, this one enjoyed some comforts from across Tamriel—smuggled through the port, for apparently the people here discourage open trade with outsiders.\n\n* * *\nI intended to travel with a caravan from Solitude to Orsinium, but the accent of these Nords confounded me so much that I ended up on a cart bound for another of Western Skyrim's holds. This one they call Hjaalmarch.\n\nWhen I saw it, I was for the first time on my journey woeful to be gone from home! Its bogs and marshes, though draped with frost, remind me of the fetid quagmires of Black Marsh. The crannogs and mud-huts of this place are pale imitations of those found in my homeland, though. And they extract so little subsistence from the fertile rot! They sate themselves mostly with fishing and trapping, and think nothing of the fermenting roots basting in the brine beneath their feet. I sought to evangelize the locals of Morthal, the hold's ""capital,"" but to no meaningful effect. Alas. I did find that their sodden log houses make excellent breeding grounds for termite grubs. I am drying some as I write this to make snacks for the village juveniles.\n\n* * *\nMy plans to reach Orsinium thwarted, I decided that I may as well visit the third of Western Skyrim's holds. Karthald, they call it. Though these Nords also speak of the village of Karthwatch. Already I have been confused between the two, and each time I see the local dryskins look at me as though I have erected the spine of jubilation at a bone-feast. Sithis take me!\n\nThis far from the frozen Sea of Ghosts, this hold features the best weather to be found in Western Skyrim. The crags, however, rip through the ground and make planting haphazard at best. Though barren, this land remains a battleground between the Nords of Western Skyrim and the stick-loving Reachfolk to the south.\n\nMy visit to Karthwatch (could they truly think of no other name-sires than the River Karth?), the hold's main settlement, was memorable. Arrayed like a fortress upon stone bluffs, its mission was to watch over Western Skyrim's neighbors to the south. This entire hold was only recently egg-hatched, within the last few years, I am told. Though I only refer to its boundaries on the map— the dryskins here have a deep and profound attachment to the land, with some clans living here for generations. They seem suitable for the role of protecting their homeland, to be sure.\n\n* * *\nTomorrow, I finally take a cart that I have thrice-confirmed is bound for Orsinium. My time in Western Skyrim, while not exactly profitable, has been an education. One I will eventually share with my shell-siblings in Gideon!"

Callisos convinced the Prince of Madness that his plain lyre had been imbued by Dibella with her raw passion.\n\nSheogorath wanted it, and in exchange gave Callisos an instrument he called Lodestone, a lyre that he tied to Callisos' soul, claiming it would bring him glory and fame—which it did.\n\nAfter some time, Callisos' great deeds and talent became legendary among the Bards College alumni. However, one morning Lodestone was found in a practice room at the college and Callisos was never seen or heard from again. It has long been surmised that Callisos constantly toured Tamriel to escape Sheogorath's wrath, but he was finally caught."

msgid "By Imperial Surveyor Buntara Gravius\n\nThe reclusive kingdom of Western Skyrim, reputed to be isolationist and close-minded, nevertheless contains much that intrepid travelers can find to enjoy in its holds and among its people. The details in this guide reflect this sentiment—though it should be noted that Western Skyrim is no place for the foolhardy traveler. With terrain as rugged as its people, neither the land nor its inhabitants suffer the ignorant with grace.\n\nAs with Eastern Skyrim, Western Skyrim consists of several holds, each with its own capital and ruling jarl. All swear fealty to the Jarl of Solitude, who rules over the strongest of these territories and wears the crown of the high king. \n\nHAAFINGAR, in the northeast portion of the realm, is dominated by mountains and frozen coastlines. The Sea of Ghosts sends an ill wind to the shore, chilling all to the bone.\n\nSolitude, astride a massive arch of stone, serves as capital of the hold and seat of the jarl and high king. The venerable and defensible Castle Dour watches over the city, which counts its fortifications among the city's first structures. The city features two main districts: the Well District, home to the city's bustling market, and the Avenues District. Scholars of architecture will find many charming homes among the Avenues, while those seeking more worldly entertainment may prefer the Wells. It should also be noted that the Blue Palace abuts the Avenues. This fine example of High Nord architecture serves as home and ruling seat for the jarl, who also carries the title of high king. I should also make note of the Arch—a spectacle of stone that hoists Solitude above the Sea of Ghosts.\n\nKilkreath Temple, set in the mountains of Haafingar, stands as a monument to the Daedric Prince Meridia. Though worship of the Daedric Princes is, at best, a controversial subject in Tamriel, the architectural splendor and calm environs alone make this temple worth the visit. Those willing to take part in heretical conversation will find the priests of Kilkreath Temple warm and hospitable, and more than willing to provide travelers with foodstuffs and warm beds. Visitors are advised to avoid travel during feasts of High Sun and Low Sun, when the temple's caretakers close its doors to conduct secret rites.\n\nDragon Bridge, a small encampment and town beside the River Karth, is named for the spectacular bridge that fords the waterway. Astride the river sits the Dragon Bridge, an ancient causeway of rough-hewn stone and, curiously, a pair of Dragon skulls set into its apex. The difference in stonework detail between the bridge's stone and these skulls has led some scholars to posit that these are actually petrified bones of ancient beasts. Others deride these claims as poetic nonsense. Remains or not, the skulls and bridge have inspired the imaginations of travelers for centuries, as they doubtless will for centuries to come.\n\nGiant camps spring up throughout the Haafingar wilderness. These aren't permanent settlements, but are instead temporary sites set up by the nomadic Giants as they move from place to place. They do have a habit of utilizing the same locations over and over, so if you find evidence of an abandoned Giant camp one day, it might be occupied by the large humanoids the next. While approaching these camps is a foolhardy endeavor, there are many experienced guides available for hire that can provide curious explorers with a chance to observe these creatures from a safe distance.\n\nAuthor's Note: As with many of Skyrim's holds, Haafingar contains barrows and caves that may appear deserted but often prove to be quite dangerous. Given the author's desire to keep readers safe, she has elected to excise reference to these dangerous locales from this edition."

Someone went to a lot of trouble to carve out these passages, but that had to have been many years ago. \n\nFortunately, this portion of the mine is still rich with silver and several other trace metals. You can see huge, untapped veins of ore running through the tunnel walls. But this presents us with quite a quandary regarding the fate of the original excavators. If they went to all the trouble and expense of constructing the mine, why did they abandon it before they had exhausted the vast reservoir of ore contained in the deposit?  \n\nDay Three\n\nToday we finished clearing one of the collapsed tunnels and broke through into an enormous chamber beyond. I'm no historian, but I'd swear there are remnants of Dwarven ruins here. There are things set apart from the rock and ore that definitely aren't natural, at any rate.\n\nAesa said she heard scuttling while we were asleep last night. Skeg told her not to worry, there are lots of things that skitter about in tunnels like this. But I've heard things too, and not the usual sounds of spiders. I almost feel like something is stalking us. Like we're being watched.\n\nDay Four\n\nWe never should have come down here. Aesa and Skeg left hours ago to scout the Dwarven ruins and neither have returned. There are pale shapes moving in the shadows and a maddening insect-like clicking echoing through the passageways. Am I hallucinating? I'm not sure I could find my way out of this place if I tried. \n\nI seem to be the only one in the camp now, though I didn't see anybody leave. The clicking sounds grow louder. I hear breathing. Earlier, I swore I heard a scream in the darkness. It sounded like Aesa. \n\nSomething's close by. I think it can smell me."

msgid "By Pjetr the Skald, of the Bards College\n\nThick of mane and fierce of heart, like the white wolves of Haafingar, High King Svagrim stalks the halls of his Blue Palace with restless intensity. Ever watchful. Ever wary. Like the descendants of Svartr who came before him, Svargrim is a king beset by enemies on all sides. Yet none of his noble line have faced such daunting odds during their reigns as our noble Wolf of Solitude.\n\nNot two years into his reign, the Sea Giant armada of Kruntharth sailed from regions unknown to besiege the high walls of his city. It's said that Svargrim stood eye-to-eye with Kruntharth from atop the battlements as the monstrous warrior demanded tribute of our king and kingdom for his mercy. But did our high king yield? Nay! He leapt from the walls and tore open the throat of that Giant like a wolf preying upon a mammoth. So inspired were Svargrim's soldiers that they threw open the gates and charged after him, driving the stunned pirates back into the ocean, never to return to our shores!\n\nLet us not forget the Great Troll Rut of 2E 265 (as if it were even possible), when the unseasonable warmth inspired broods of the creatures to rampage across the western holds while locked in unspeakably horrid acts. The Wolf split up twenty of the unholy couplings himself, and further divided those forty creatures with his sword! To this day, trolls tend to avoid the area closest to the walls of Solitude the way chub loons avoid sabre cat dens.\n\nYou can be certain that when the Akaviri came to Skyrim searching for conquest, they took one look at our fearsome king on our palisades and sailed straight east for easier prey. And though they were brought low by the machinations of Dark Elves, Mud Lizards, and the so-called Skald Prince—who diminishes our noble craft by mere association—they made short work of Windhelm and the falsely crowned High Queen of the East, Mabjaarn Flame-Hair.\n\nIf only Emperor Moricar the Middling had taken heed before committing his legions to our borders in a vain attempt to subjugate Skyrim from his cushioned seat on the Ruby Throne. Though his cowardice spared him the same embarrassing death as his predecessor, the howls of the Wolf routing his army in single battle no doubt carried all the way to the White-Gold Tower and haunted his dreams to the end of his days!\n\nAnd who was it that saved the western holds from the Witchman throng stampeding out from Cyrodiil after the Longhouse Emperors finally fell? Thousands of those mongrels came clawing and biting into our lands like cornered, rabid dogs, but our noble Wolf strode out and showed them whose fangs were sharpest. When have you seen more than a handful of Reachfolk in our lands since?\n\nTake heart, Nords of the West. Though troubles assail us from east and west, south and north, you have nothing to fear from that motley pact of Elves, lizards, and iceheels, or the unwashed hordes of the Despot of Markarth. The Wolf of Solitude keeps a tireless vigil atop his tower. Our enemies will find no safe haven in our wondrous realm."

Their legacy was of a musical competition in their town's square using talharpas. They drew such a crowd with their raucous, high-tempo interplay, that people started dancing and cheering. Locals remember it as the greatest concert they ever heard. Afterward, Jibhan challenged Dozzen to a race home. When a hillside trail narrowed, Jibhan got the better of Dozzen. Nearly home, Jibhan had victory in his sight, but looked back before the finish to see Dozzen was not behind him.\n\nDozzen had fallen down the hill, dashed against boulders. He was bleeding profusely. Pallid and breathing shallow, Dozzen said all he could remember was their triumphant musical competition.The townsfolk had declared no winner, but were inspired by the interwoven song. \n\nKnowing his end was near, he bade Jibhan vow to use his sinew to craft a new talharpa and use it to inspire the people to dance. Jibhan did so, crafting this very instrument with his brother's sinew, but could not bring himself to play it with joy, so he donated it to the Bards College."

msgid "By Gilbard Bacqure\n\nWhile there have been many accounts detailing the various meads enjoyed by Nords, there is surprisingly little information on their preferences in savory cuisine. While Nord recipes may not be as thrilling or complex as those of some other cultures, I believe them still worthy of note! There are many delicacies to be had on Nord feasting tables. They are a hearty people who drink and eat with more passion and vigor than any others I've met! Tasteless food represents as much an insult to them as cowardice on the battlefield. I shall transcribe my explorations through their cuisine here. \n\nHorker Soup\nThere is an abundance of horkers in Skyrim. While they may not look entirely appetizing on the surface, they represent a wealth of untapped delicious potential! And as Nords are wont to do, they've taken a form of sustenance and made a stew out of it. I suppose it only makes sense. A hardy people who live most of their lives in the cold, covered in furs and trudging through snow, would certainly be purveyors of warm meals such as this. Horker soup is uncomplicated, wonderfully salty, and has a thin broth. It's best served with a warm loaf of bread to sop up the last dredges. \n\nHot Apple Cabbage Stew\nThis stew is a basic Nord household favorite. Ordinarily, a dish this simple might not be worth mentioning in a book on cuisine. But not in this case! While the recipe for the hot apple cabbage stew is simple, the taste and comfort of consuming such a dish is far from it! For many Nords, this meal reminds them of their youth. Though, there is some debate over the method of cooking the stew, mainly in the use of the apples. A strict divide exists between those who believe in mashing, and those who believe in cutting. I myself have sampled both and found them to be equally delicious. This is not an opinion I would share with a Nord, however. Most favor one over the other, usually to a violent degree.\n\nMammoth Steak \nThose who first looked upon the mammoths of Skyrim and thought 'I think I'd like to eat that!' greatly inspire me. Nord's are known for their staunch bravery. Only a people so averse to cowardice would think to make a meal out of something so colossal. While much of the animal is tough and inedible, the loin is exquisitely tender. Cutting a slice from this impressive part of the beast yields a flank of meat that can be seared or broiled.\n\nSeared Slaughterfish\nI do not envy those who venture into murky waters in order to catch the creatures needed to make this meal. I am entirely grateful to them, however, for it is their bravery that allows us to experience the deliciousness of the seared slaughterfish! The proper Nord tradition requires the cook to sear the fish (once picked clean of bones, of course) until the skin is blackened. Some prefer to cook the flesh slowly by wrapping the fish in cabbage leaves, searing the skin as the very last step before consumption. Both methods work equally well, in my opinion."

They are a hearty people that drink and eat with more passion and vigor than any I've ever encountered! Tasteless food is as much an insult to them as cowardice on the battlefield. I shall transcribe my explorations through their cuisine here.\n\nSweet Treats\n\nHoney-Dipped Apples\nI would be remiss if I did not discuss the tart apples of Skyrim. A staple of Nord households, this fruit is as common in Skyrim as a mudcrab along a riverbank! It can be eaten as nature intended, directly from a tree, or it can be used to enhance stews, meat dishes, or salads. Perhaps the best use is as a dessert. The ingredients for a honey-dipped apple are rather obvious. Simplicity is at the heart of most Nord recipes—the foundations are plain and uncomplicated, but the end result is truly a taste to experience! Apples are either served roasted or raw, then iced with a drizzle of sweet milk and honey. They are sticky, messy, sweet, and tart. And wholly wonderful!\n\nSnowberry Crostata\nOn their own, snowberries are so tart as to be quite unpalatable. The same cannot be said of a snowberry crostata! Simpler than a pie and yet no less delectable, this pastry perfectly marries the tartness of the berry with the sweetness of the bread to create a truly memorable experience. Enjoy this delicacy after a meal as a treat, or even early in the morning before the common Nord goes about his day. The versatile nature of the flavors make both options equally appealing.\n\nJazbay Crostata\nIn contrast, the Jazbay Crostata is strictly a delicacy best enjoyed after a heartier meal. While it is most often used by mages, the distinctive sweetness of these grapes cannot be ignored by any who consider themselves a food connoisseur. The dark, sweet juice of the grape sinks into the dough to create a deliciously moist base, though it's sturdy enough to not be soggy. Some say the sweetness overwhelms, but I say they are absolutely wrong! \n\nHoney Nut Treat\nNords love their honey. It sweetens their mead perfectly, but that's not all! Popular in many a meadery across Skyrim, the honey nut treat is a sweet partner to any kind of drink. While messy, this sticky, nut-studded dough can conveniently be skewered on a stick so you can carry it anywhere. Whether you're traveling long distances or just enjoying a drink by the fire at your favorite inn, the honey nut treat is an enjoyable snack that everyone should try at least once."

Many would not stay dead. Among these was Morokei.\n\nWhen Morokei lived, he dwelt in the ruin we know as Labyrinthian. Once, many lifetimes ago, it was known as the city of Bromjunaar and was the seat of the Dragon Priests' power.

I must first crack these before I can unearth the Dragon Priest himself.\n\nThe lumbering undead in this ruin seem blind to the very presence of the warding fires, suggesting that they cannot affect them in any way. I, however, am no common skeleton or shambling corpse. It shall not be an overly difficult task to undo the magic on the warding flames, with a precise application of the proper reversal spells.\n\nAnd unless the draugr start learning how to light torches and manage to trip into one of the braziers, the flames will stay extinguished long enough for me to finish the job."

My Uncle Hofnar used to spin yarns about sleeping with one eye open in his seafaring days—to keep a lookout for squalls. I've been trying to outdo him by sleeping with both eyes open. Hasn't worked.\n\nBallista's dry. Unless we start firing pots and pans out of it, I think it's just expensive firewood now. Wasn't all that useful anyway. I glanced over the wall yesterday and saw one of those damned Giants swinging one of the bolts like a club. Just what they need. More clubs.\n\nI don't know how much more of this we can take. I hear those damned vampires scratching at the walls all night. Whispering to us—trying to coax us out with their black magic. I'm deaf in one ear, so it only bothers me half as much as the others. But I had to drag Rudhild off the parapet before she jumped headfirst into a pack of those bloodsuckers. Ogvar tied her up and splashed water on her face. She's still wailing and babbling though.

msgid "Thane Ogvar,\n\nI did as you asked and scrounged for any information on these Sea Giants. Not surprisingly, I haven't turned up much. Most of what I learned came from those old salts we pulled out of the harbor just before the vampires made it to Kyne's Perch. They seemed eager to tell me all they knew, but I doubt we can count any of it as wholly accurate. They are sailors, after all. The only thing a sailor does better than sail is lie. Even so, it's all we've got.\n\nAccording to Stegryr, Sea Giants are related to the Giants we find on the mainland, but smarter. He compared the relationship to himself and his touched cousin, Tornir. That falls in line with Ingfir's testimony. He swears he heard one of them talk. Not just the half-giants, mind. He said one of the largest of them yelled something in Cyrodilic. If that's true, it turns what we know of Giants completely on its head. I've heard tales of ancient giants, and Atmoran titans, and such, but I just thought they were childrens' stories. For all Stegryr's insistence, he admitted he'd never actually seen one before now. Take that for what it's worth.\n\nIndeed, all the sailors admitted they'd never seen a Sea Giant. ""Anyone who sees one doesn't survive to tell the tale,"" they say. Only one of them claims to have seen a Sea Giant before now: Thengret. She's the grayest of them—at least 80 years-old, I wager. She grew up in a fishing village just west of Dawnstar, and her grandmother told her that Sea Giants raid the coast when ""the Pale grows frigid as a draugr's heart, horkers freeze to death on the rocks, and trolls weep from the bitter cold."" Well, we suffered such a winter in 2E 532, and standing on the coast in a frosty gale, she saw one of their longships gliding through the snow and sleet. That's it. That's the story.\n\nI don't have to tell you that we've seen mild winters these last few years. Milder than some, anyway. So, Thengret's story just doesn't make sense—until, of course, you add these vampires to it. We all know the stories about Falgravn; how he can twist people's minds and sink ships in frothing gyres of blood. Maybe he offered the Giants something, or bent their will to his. Either way, it's an alliance no one could have seen coming. I pray it doesn't reach the mainland. I don't know if the people of Solitude are strong enough to drive it back.\n\nThunvilde"

msgid "By Lady Essenia, Master Alchemist and High Chamberlain of Greymoor Keep\n\nMy most elder kin often ask me how I could bear to shed my crown. As if power rests solely in the hands of those who rule. Is the Ashen Lord's own story not proof enough of their mistake?\n\nI must admit, when our new king first arrived upon my threshold, I shared their misgivings. Centuries of rulership had twisted my mind—had convinced me that the simple axioms of ruler and ruled were the only truths worth respecting. Politics. Thrones. Courtiers and petitions. How blind I was to the reins and bridle I placed upon myself! For some, truth and fulfillment rest upon the throne. For others—vampires like myself—true fulfillment lies in study. The shimmering flask, the gleaming scalpel and syringe—these are the only jewels with a claim to my heart. For too long I ignored my vocation. The rise of our Ashen Lord allowed me to rediscover it.\n\nI have always marveled at the complexity and mutability of the vampiric infection. Each strain carries a long and storied history, and each bestows a unique suite of gifts upon those claimed by the disease. Now, unfettered by the inanities of rulership, I ask myself: can these gifts be refined? Can these strains be unified?\n\nBehold, the fruit of my research! Chaotica Vampiris! A revolution in our vampiric nature. Unlike Sanguinare Vampiris or Porphyric Hemophilia, this new affliction targets those already turned to vampirism. While blending the bloodlines through alchemical means provided small successes, the true catalyst was chaotic creatia, claimed from the source of all vampirism: Coldharbour. Molag Bal, in his haste to claim Tamriel for himself, forgets that doors ofter open both ways.\n\nI call the result of a Chaotica Vampiric infection a ""Bloodknight."" These new creations possess greater speed and strength than any vampire yet known.\n\nAs in all great scientific endeavors, the results have been mixed. The effort to restrain their baser instincts remains a struggle. With more research, I'm confident that I can further refine the condition. Luckily, new vampires arrive at our gates with each passing night. My slave pens overflow with test subjects. All I need is time."

There are still those among us that enjoy scholarly pursuits and the broadening of our minds. Perhaps we are but a token few these days, but hope is not lost.

msgid "Transcribed and Annotated by Ysogar\n\n[Annotator's Note: I found this charred journal in the bottom of my grandmother Nan's memory chest. It isn't her handwriting, so it must have belonged to another relative. Her mother, perhaps? I transcribed and annotated it into a new journal, to better preserve it for posterity.]\n\nI recently started having strange dreams—they began on my first night in Solitude. All my life, I never dreamed. I had no idea what dreams really were, though others described them to me. Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me.\n\nBut here? I can only call them dreams because they have no resemblance to what's going around me when I'm awake. I'm writing them down to make better sense of them.\n\nMy first few dreams were set in Solitude, but I saw no buildings. Just the natural terrain. And the wind. So strong! I remember walking from the arch, then down the shore to a camp. Temporary shelters built out of fur and wood, but I saw no people. Where were they? They left behind burning cooking fires and half-eaten food.\n\n[This sounds like pre-Solitude days when the Nords made a makeshift camp along the Karth River, using the arch as a windbreaker. I've had a few dreams like this myself thanks to the stories Nan told.]\n\nAfter that, when I showed up where Solitude now stands—thank goodness for landmarks like the arch—some buildings sprouted up. Again, I saw nobody, but I heard nearby conversations about High King Erling, who had ordered the construction of a temple to the gods and wanted to start planning the walls. A woman named Thryrahilde championed a specific style for the walls, stating that not only would they be distinctive, but would afford better protection than the other plans presented. Her opposition called her by name, but I never heard their names. Lost to history?\n\nBecause clearly my dreams are taking me back into the past somehow. Just not fully. I don't see anyone. It's … so lonely in my dreams, except for the voices.\n\n[Traveling to the past in dreams? Nonsense. Also, none of the names of the original architects of Solitude made it through the generations in my family's stories. Regardless, I can't speak to the existence of Thryrahilde, but it is true that Solitude's outer walls are distinctive, and the temple in Castle Dour continues to hold a strong place in the hearts of our people.]\n\nIn my next dream, I'm watching priests blessing stones before masons add them to the wall. That was only one dream, but I received the impression that each and every stone received a blessing from the priests. Erling's voice drifted in and out, as if he was directly overseeing the process.\n\n[Nan does tell of how each stone was blessed by the gods. As far as I know, that is lore known only to my family. Did Nan get this from family tales or from this journal? I trust her more than this writer, so I think that information stands as true.]\n\nThe next night I watched the Blue Palace begin to take shape. As I stood within its half-finished corridors, I heard a screech and a clatter of tools.\n\n""There's a ghost! I saw her!""\n\nIt took a moment, but given the proximity of the voice, I could only ask: Does he mean me? Can he see me? Why can't I see him? Then I woke up abruptly and couldn't sleep again that night.\n\n[Odd. Perhaps this is someone's attempt at storytelling instead of an actual journal entry?]\n\nAs if to protect me from people who could see me, we leaped forward again in time. I say ""we"" because surely some other agency is at play here. This time, and over the next several nights, I saw the Bards College take shape. The very first bard walked across the finished threshold as a hazy shadow, accompanied by singing. I couldn't quite make out the words.\n\nBut I saw the shadow. And the shadow saw me. I woke up screaming this time.\n\n[I lose patience with this narrative presented as history.]\n\nThe next dream was a coronation. My guess? Olaf One-Eye. Why? Because in that same dream, I saw an effigy of this man burned. Just like the one they're burning tomorrow in the annual Burning of King Olaf, a local festival.\n\nHis eyes—both sets—burned into mine. Now I have burns over most of my body. They are healing, but I dare not sleep again. Not ever.\n\n[I'm not sure why Nan kept this journal among her things. It's nonsense—pieces of known history spun into dreams. Bah. But just in case, I spent the time to transcribe it.]\n\n[A few weeks have passed, and I'm dreaming about words catching alight, swirling around the one-eyed high king. This morning, I woke to the smell of my beard burning. It was charred. Tomorrow we burn King Olaf in effigy. I will seek out the Divines today and hope to free myself from whatever dream trap I've fallen into—before the festival. Why did I ever open that charred journal?]"

msgid "by Odgrete Bjersen \n\nCount yourself lucky if you have not encountered a death hound in the wild. Few who do survive the experience. These large, muscular dogs with glowing red eyes are undead and often reside alongside vampires, serving as guardians of their lairs. Should you find yourself face to face with one of these creatures, you likely have other, more pressing matters to deal with. \n\nWhile many death hounds remain indoors, serving as guard-dogs for their vampiric masters, there are those who roam the wilderness, as well. They play an important role in the ecology of the areas they inhabit, often to the detriment of the habitat itself. They are voracious, undead predators that attack everything alive in sight. It's still unclear whether they hunt prey for sustenance or merely to satisfy some unholy blood lust. They do eviscerate and consume their prey, but the wide variety of quarry suggests it is less about survival and more about temperament. \n\nOne of the most unique traits of the death hound is its wintry bite. It is often said that the death hound has a bite ""as cold as the grave."" Almost like a poison, a bite from a death hound can freeze the very flesh of its prey and render it immobile. Whether this magic is somehow tied to the vampires, or just an innate quality of this monstrous creature, no one is certain. \n\nLocal flora and fauna tend to suffer in areas where death hounds abound. The beasts are so indiscriminate when hunting, they can raze an area and leave nothing left alive if they stay too long. Fortunately, vampire covens that operate in the wilderness are often transient in nature. They too, must relocate when their prey becomes scarce."

msgid "By Minerva Calo, Imperial Chronicler\n\nYou can learn a lot about a people by examining their superstitions. Ancient fears run deep—deeper even than cherished traditions or historical enmities. While few Nords will admit to fear of any kind, I've found one topic that reliably sets a northerner on edge: the ""snow ghosts."" At first, I thought they referred to ice wraiths or wispmothers, but I've come to learn these ""snow ghosts"" bear no similarity to those monsters. Alternatively referred to as ""bogles,"" ""riekr-kin,"" or ""clatter-coats,"" they plague herders and traders alike—stealing livestock, stabbing wandering merchants in their sleep, and spoiling root cellars with poisonous slime. I gathered the following testimonials in Morthal and Solitude. I leave it to you, dear reader, to parse the fact from the fiction.\n\nBonbetta, a Morthal fishmonger, had this to say: ""Aye! I've seen those scamps more than once! Skulking around the docks they were. Snatching up our nets and tearing out the fish. They only come out on the moonless nights, you know. So's you can't see them proper. My eyes aren't what they used to be, mind, but seemed to me they had sharpish ears like an Elf, they hunched over like Goblins, and they had skin like the underbelly of a dead trout. All white, you see? My husband set out to run them off, but they're quick as a whip, and Ralmig's knees creak like a dead pine nowadays. Probably for the better. Way I hear it, they'll kill a person as soon as look at them.""\n\nI met a herdsman near the Dragon Bridge who could barely contain his contempt for the creatures—shaking his fist often as he gnawed on a dried kilnr root. He asked not to be identified. ""To Sovngarde with those bastards! Used to be that you'd only hear about them once or twice your whole life long. Now, they've snatched up three of my best cows in the last six months alone. Can't hardly get a wink of rest anymore. It's bad enough we've got to compete with damned mammoths for grazing space. Now I'm wringing my beard day and night worrying about clatter-coats cutting my livestock to pieces. My brother tells me it's just rustlers in black leathers, but I've seen them. No Nord could hunch the way they do. And the clothes they wear—I've never seen the like. Like it's carved off one of those damned cave-bugs you see near Morthal every now and again. Next time I'm in Solitude, I'm going to fetch a good, sturdy bow and pierce one of those cow thieves right between the eyes.""\n\nGilse Tistar, a surprisingly pleasant Dark Elf from the Bards College, dismissed these testimonies as local superstition and nothing more. ""You know how these Nords are. Honestly, they'll blame any misfortune on bizarre creatures or foreigners. Just the other day, some pale-eyed merchant blamed me for putting an ""Elf hex"" on their dog. I mean, what is that? And why would I care about their dog? It's all nonsense. That said, nonsense often makes for entertaining verse! Just last night I wrote a farce about a five-eyed troll. It will land with a splash. Guaranteed.""\n\nI met a wild-eyed vagrant in Karthwatch who offered a truly outlandish claim, flapping his hands about as he spoke. ""They're Elves! Snow Elves! These people … Goblins some say! And Riekr. Riekr! Can you imagine? Feh. I've seen these things, missy. Got a real good look. They're paler than the palest Nord, with pointy ears and noses like a bat! You say, 'Elves don't have noses like bats!' But you'd be wrong, missy. Dead wrong! Ole Ysgramor cut their noses off so you could tell them apart from other Elves and drove them underground like the worms they are. Now they're all hunched and squinty from living in caves and never seeing the sun! And they're coming back. Mark me! They aim to take Skyrim back, just like they did back on the Crying Night. Beware, missy! Beware!""\n\nReal or imagined, these creatures grant us a fascinating glimpse into Nordic folklore and serve as a perfect example of how ancient ghost-stories still plague the northerners today."

I count this as no excuse for the damage to the Tom, and therefore advocate for the preservation of our artifacts.\n\n<Efnort clears his throat, looks sternly at Hrofgen.>\n\nEfnort: These instruments represent a legacy of musical history. The Bards College should want to preserve them for as long as possible, to show students, tourists, luthiers, and other crafters these masterworks and pieces of cultural history.\n\n<Thaezara stands.>\n\nThaezara: Efnort, you must admit that an instrument is like a lover. Is it not at its most beauteous when plucked, strummed, and played until singing joyously? Caged, they are left silent and lonesome, no?\n\n<Efnort shifts uncomfortably. Maybe the rumors about he and Thaezara are true?>\n\nEfnort: Thaezara, esteemed one. Though you make a passionate plea, I am more inclined to be delicate with such an instrument. Revered. It having given so much to Nirn already. Does it not deserve reverence? It simply cannot be played forever.\n\nThaezara: You should be so lucky to have an instrument in such fine condition that it begs to ring out its song!\n\n<Thaezara is near shouting. Efnort sits down timidly.>\n\nViatrix: However fine the condition of the instrument, Thaezara, it won't matter if every student at the college is pawing it and noodling every terrible sonnet they can imagine upon it.\n\nThaezara: How dare you—\n\n<Thaezara jumps at Viatrix and tries to claw her face!>\n\nCatrelle: Enough! Sit down, the both of you!\n\n<Catrelle breaks up a minor fight between Viatrix and Thaezara. Efnort looks away.>\n\nCatrelle: Stop being so dramatic! Tamriel's bards look to us to make mature decisions for the culture of bards as a whole. Act like you deserve the honor!\n\nTwains-the-Night: If you truly mean all bards, then let me be the Argonian representative to express my dismay in your needs to preserve everything in a world where all things eventually return to Nirn. In our land, nothing survives time or the marsh. We make use of everything, and if something has no use, we commit it again to the swamp.\n\nHrofgen: Exactly! I think what the scaleback means, in regular words, is that we should make use of these great instruments while we have them. Eventually they will be stolen, or burned, or have something spilled on them, you know?\n\nTwains: Scaleback?\n\nCatrelle: Order!\n\n<Continued in Volume 2.>"

msgid "<Most pages are scorched black or covered in a thick layer of ice that burns at the touch. Only a few entries are legible.>\n\nI suppose I could whine or complain that my search for an education led me here, to Morthal. Graciously described as a backwater on the best of days, there's not much that I would recommend to other travelers. The damp scent that wafts off the rivers pervades everything. And from the moment I arrived, the locals made clear they don't relish outsiders in their midst. Nobody acts hostile; they just keep their distance. Which is fine by me.\n\nHowever, three details about this little town cause me to appreciate it ever so slightly. First, if the sun is up, the sawmill operates non-stop. It produces a loud steady drone that helps my sleep during the day. My research into the Dark Practice is most efficient through the dim hours, so I welcome the ability to enjoy a full day's rest.\n\nAdditionally, Morthal is precisely the hub of necromantic power that I hoped for. It hums with death energy. My nightly hunt for the source should soon prove fruitful. Then, with some adjustments, I can begin the siphoning ritual. Even a partial extraction of the local power should provide enough potency for several years of study.\n\nLastly, I met a local who has become quite the enjoyable companion. She's the daughter of the town's jarl. Although she admits to never leaving Morthal, she exhibits a strange wisdom and curiosity about the world that I admire. Her mother originally comes from Solitude, so perhaps she is the source of this unexpected worldliness. But most of all, I've found that she's kind. We spend quite a bit of time together and I've told her about the nature of my investigations. She did not recoil in disgust as many would. Instead she promised to keep my secret and assist where possible. I confess that I look forward to spending more time with her.\n\n* * *\n… feel like I'm much closer to determining the necromantic source around the town. Last night I wandered east while testing the soil for traces of mortus energy. The new moons next week should properly amplify the ambient resonances. Tracking the locus should be easy during that period.\n\nWhile in the woods, we saw a figure standing in the distance. She watched us but did not move. Freiwen called her a ""clever woman,"" a local term for hedge mages. For the first time since my arrival, I grew nervous. Interference from some nosy old crone is the last thing I need right now.\n\nOh, yes, Freiwen joined me on this trip. She had to sneak out from her house, which I found endearing. I enjoy her presence. No one could ever accuse me of being a romantic but walking under the stars with her felt precious.\n\n* * *\n… refer to them as the Kjenstag ruins. No one that I've asked knows anything about their history. But without a doubt it contains powerful spiritual emanations. I must adjust the Lanovo siphoning ritual for the sheer volume of energy, but those calculations should be simple enough.\n\nPerhaps Freiwen would agree to be the living attractant. I planned on using a wolf or some other nearby wildlife. But a born-and-raised native to these lands would be more effective. Lanovo claimed that his attractant suffered no ill effects …."

I'm likely either dead or in the dungeon, but I was able to send word your way. I don't have solid proof that this Icereach Coven you're hunting is in Haafingar hold, but something's rotten in the capital city of Solitude. I know I'm on the right trail. Unfortunately, it seems they know it, too. I wish I had more information for you. I'm sorry.\n\nBring what I found to Queen Gerhyld. She's more levelheaded than the high king.

Locals are suspicious of strangers. Guards always seem to be watching. Even in a city the size of Solitude—even among Nords—I stick out like a sore thumb. \n—\nMade one contact at the royal stables. Young woman named Kovynn. Starry-eyed. Naive. Told her to keep watch for unusual travelers. No one else is talking. I'm going to settle into a routine. Get people used to seeing me around.\n—\nEverything passes through the Lonely Troll at some point. It's the best place in the city to talk to the locals and learn about what's going on. There's an Orc that frequents the establishment. Goes by the name of Maugh. He seems willing to talk, as long as you keep his mug filled. If anyone knows something about the Icereach Coven, I'm sure to find them in the Lonely Troll.\n—\nAny trust I built up with the locals evaporated at the mere mention of witches. Won't say a word about them, unless you count prayers to the gods. I guess they take dark magic more seriously this close to the Reach, but they'd rather shut their ears to it than court misfortune.\n—\nKorvynn came through for me. Said some rugged types arrived on mountain mares, trying a little too hard not to be noticed. They put up postings all around town. Recruiting for something. Sharp girl.\n\n* * *\n\n<A recruitment flier is stuffed in between the pages.>\n\nLaborers and Craft Workers Needed!\n\nBrave folk sought for distant and dangerous work in uncharted territory beyond the Druadach Mountains.

Nobody seems to know what all this labor's for or where it's needed.\n\n* * *\n<The journal continues.>\n\nI noticed Redguard ships making regular stops at the docks here. Considering my chilly reception, I find that curious.\n—\nCost me a good bit of gold, but the local snitch, Greyga, who I found gambling in an alley, provided a solid lead. Redguard mariners are bringing shipments up from Sentinel. Manifests say housewares. Crews looks more like mercenaries than traders. She saw one discreetly marking some of the crates. Think I'll poke around.\n—\nTried to grab what was inside, but I got caught and it slipped from my hand before I could wrest it from the crate. I managed to lose the thugs who were after me. I'm just hoping they never got a good look at me.\n—\nSupposed to meet with Lyris Titanborn before her audience with Queen Gerhyld at the Blue Palace. Tell her what I've found so she can convince High King Svargrim that there's a threat to his domain. All I've got is suspicions. Nothing solid. I've heard the high queen rules with a lighter touch. She might be the sympathetic ear that gets us in the door."

msgid "Compiled by Erisa Sylbenitte of the Coterie of Organized Scholars\n\nIn gratitude to the many families of Western Skyrim who shared their family lore with me.\n\nWe know much more about the High Kings Erling, Harald, Logrolf, Svartr, and Svargrim than about those who filled the gaps between their reigns. Yet, due to sources such as Nord verbal lore, some important and perhaps salacious stories of earlier high kings and their families pass through family lines, unrecorded in mediums such as treatises, books, and scrolls. Herein are a couple of the more, shall we say, scandalous tales of the royal families of Solitude.\n\nThe Bloody End of ""Head-Rolling"" Roleke\n\nSometime in the late first era, a young jarl named Irthvyd the Impassive, so called for his stoic reserve and calm presence, rose to prominence among the Nords. Though Irthvyd's native hold's name is lost to the ages, he helped Solitude regain order after the ruling high king, ""Head-Rolling"" Roleke, decapitated over twenty rebels in less than five minutes … by herself. (Some sources state that her then-spouse numbered among these twenty—she went through a succession of many spouses during her reign.) Shortly after, the population of Solitude rose up, having dealt with enough of this behavior from their leader, and besieged Roleke within the Blue Palace itself!\n\nIrthvyd, along with his warriors, heard of the rising disquiet due to being in the area, so he headed toward Solitude. When he reached the gate, Kyne appeared to Irthvyd, stating Roleke had died at the hands of her progeny only hours before. Sadly, these sons and daughters also died due to wounds dealt by the fierce and bloodthirsty Roleke. Thus, Solitude had no high king or blood heirs in residence any longer.\n\nIn rode Irthvyd, with the favor of Kyne, ready to help the citizens of Solitude untangle the resulting snarl. Mere hours later, he was crowned High King of Solitude, with the blessings of Kyne upon him!\n\nThanks to Irthvyd's steady rule, peace settled upon the holds after years of Roleke's bloody reign. Decades passed, and young Irthvyd became middle-aged Irthvyd, with no spouse. While the lack of heirs is not an inordinate problem among Nord royalty, it did raise questions. Irthvyd steadfastly refused both a spouse and the possibility of blood heirs. The title of high king eventually passed to Irthvyd's most senior advisor, Temylda, who battled several jarls in single combat and won. This, of course, led to my next bit of gathered verbal lore.\n\nAlldimar the Ghostmaker\n\nForty years after Temylda's reign ended, a new high king took the throne through bloodshed and violence. Alldimar, a Nord with many skirmishes against the Reachmen under his belt, succeeded at wresting the title from an untested child heir primarily through a good sense of battle tactics and a knowledge of arcane matters that most Nords would sneer at. Despite his blood-drenched ascent, as he settled into his rule, peace spread throughout the land, and none could complain about his administrative and diplomatic behaviors after he took Solitude. As it stood, many had questioned the wisdom of passing rulership to a child, whose name and provenance is lost to history. Additionally, it suits the Nord's battle-seeking nature to have such a heroic and field-tested figure as their leader.\n\nYet, all was not completely well with Alldimar. Sometimes servants caught their liege talking to someone who wasn't there. They also whispered about one of his advisors, an icy-eyed woman named Freiretta, who kept to herself when not in Alldimar's presence. None were allowed in her quarters.\n\nAs these stories spread among Solitude's people, a sense of unease grew. Had Alldimar been hit on the head one too many times in battle? And who was Freiretta really? Was something more going on here?\n\nA year and a day after he ascended to the throne, the accidents started. Each week, another person in Solitude would die in a bizarre fashion. One was pinned to the Lonely Troll by a badly aimed arrow that was carried by the wind oddly. Another simply tripped, landed on his arse, and died. Yet another got trampled by horkers fleeing some unseen threat.\n\nAnd servants whispered that they started hearing disembodied voices around the high king's quarters.\n\nOnly after Alldimar's death a year and a day after the first accident did his secret get revealed: the skulls of every single one of those ""accident"" victims nestled together on a secret shelf within the high king's quarters. To what purpose, though?\n\nWhatever the reason, High King Alldimar gained the moniker ""Ghostmaker"" due to this finding.\n\nMy sources note that priests saw to the proper rites for these displaced remains, though servants claim that they hear voices and see shapes out of the corners of their eyes within the Blue Palace to this day."

They strike without warning, leaving death and worse in their wake. I have seen the devastation left behind by these supernatural storms. The forces called forth can kill or transform the living caught within them into near-mindless shells we've come to call the harrowed, though some become a new kind of feral vampire we now refer to as harrowfiends. Of course, not everyone exposed to the storms suffers from one of these afflictions, but I have yet to determine any rhyme or reason as to who dies, who transforms, and who walks away unscathed.\n\nAs I continue my research into the phenomenon, I can say with some certainty that the harrowstorms are created via some sort of Reach magic ritual. The ritual uses various arcane components, including some sort of fetish or totem, and an alchemical mixture, in addition to a ritualistic chant to focus and unleash the magic.\n\nI still have no idea whether the resulting afflictions represent the ultimate goal of the harrowstorms or if they are just an unfortunate result of some more insidious purpose. Nor do I know for certainty who is behind the supernatural events. More research is required to determine how the storms go about killing or transforming their victims, and whether or not there may be a way to restore what was taken from them. Time will tell."

Certainly, we have no opinion on the matter of crowns or east versus west. There are more important things in this world than who rules which expanse of snow and ice. If only the other ""Great"" Houses shared this understanding, then the Dunmer would be so much better off. \n\nWhile the diplomatic purpose of this trip may have been a waste, the journey may yet prove useful. I have heard rumors that an ancient faction is once again active and operating in Skyrim. The witches of the Icereach Coven seem involved, but they are rank amateurs compared to the rumors I have chanced upon. I relish the opportunity to study the ways of this ancient faction. There is power in dark magic, after all. If these rumors are true, that power could be mine.\n\nI may extend my stay a bit and see what I can learn. Perhaps I can use the knowledge to raise my status back in Morrowind. Others in House Telvanni have studied such things, but none have been this close to the source of power. I can feel that something lies beneath this land. Something dark. Something… powerful. I will find it and make it mine."

msgid "From the Masonry of Solitude Digest\n\nI have had few opportunities to update my initial corpus on the construction and stylings of my beloved homeland, and even now my quill shakes with curiosity. To think that, within my lifetime, I would be able to put to paper a fifth addendum, and one that involves so illustrious an architectural example as Castle Dour!\nYes, loyal readers of my digests will be familiar with the Main Keep, the Svartr's Donjon, the Temple of the Divines, and the curtain walls that dominate the skyline of Solitude. Our High King Svargrim has seen fit to add another finger to this stone fist—the most ambitious one yet! Though construction only started within the past year, it already nears completion.\n\nWe call the new edifice the Tower of the Wolf, drawing its name from the noble beast that adorns Solitude's heraldry. How impressive it looks, sweeping up to the stark sky, dwarfing even Svartr's Donjon! I am happy to report that the quarry which furnished the castle's original stone was able to supply what was needed for the construction of the Tower of the Wolf. Reports of the quarry's depletion were apparently unfounded.\n\nAs excited as I am to discuss the Tower of the Wolf in greater architectural detail, I am unfortunately unable to. Access to the tower has been denied to all but those actively working on the structure. I appealed to the Blue Palace for special exception, given my area of interest, but the bureaucrats rebuffed me. I was undeterred in my appeals, and you can imagine my shock when I received a reply not from some minor courtier, but from the high king himself!\n\n""The interior spaces of the Tower of the Wolf must be maintained in secrecy, given the prying eyes of Jorunn the False King"" wrote High King Svargrim. I could not deny his most pragmatic logic, for the tower is ultimately of military value. And yet there is hope. ""The tower nears completion even as I write this missive,"" High King Svargrim continued. ""And when it is complete, the people of Solitude will understand what an accomplishment this edifice is for our people.""\n\nWe need only wait, my loyal readers!"

msgid "Exarch Ulfra presented an interesting challenge. Can my alchemy and sorcery harrow one of her kind? By design, the harrowstorms are not meant to affect our lycanthrope brothers and sisters, but in the centuries since the Gray Host last set out to conquer, the breeds of vampires and werewolves have become a diaspora, promulgated across the world. Not all of them have the sense to bow before the Ashen Lord, including the prisoners Ulfra captured today. \n\nShe could have easily ripped these lesser creatures apart for their defiance, but instead she delivered them to me for a more methodical dissection. There's a hunter's cunning hiding in that bestial skull.\n\n* * *\nThe prisoners respect a pack hierarchy. An affectation of the origin of their curse, no doubt. By holding their leader, Edjar, hostage, the others remain compliant. By offering a slim mercy to the other werewolves, Edjar assumes the role of willing test subject. They are dreadfully simple creatures, after all.\n\n* * *\nThe incredible constitution of the werewolf, even in its human shape, creates one of many obstacles I must overcome to complete my study. The netherroot seemingly has no effect on the subject, even in its concentrated form. Weakening the grip of the body on the soul will be the first step toward delivering it to the desired destination. \n\n* * *\nI should have thought of it sooner. The creature's connection to Oblivion is something I can leverage, even if it is tied to a different realm within that great expanse. That connection can help bridge the gap between Mundus and what lies beyond, and the werewolf's lifeblood can imbue the netherroot with a vigor that our undeath simply cannot duplicate.\n\n* * *\nIt's working. With each new refinement of the blood distillate, the netherroot brew grows stronger and more toxic. The werewolf shows greater signs of affliction with every injection. The only question that remains is whether or not its soul can be successfully exchanged when it inevitably succumbs to the ritual."

msgid "By High Priest Ingurt\n\nNord religion has taken a number of interesting turns over the centuries. Our earliest beliefs were thought to have originated in Atmora and revolved around the worship of animal totems. These animals—Dragon, Hawk, She-Wolf, Snake, Moth, Owl, Whale, Bear, and Fox—seem to correspond to the Eight Divines plus Lorkhan. Later, the Dragon rose to prominence and gave rise to the Dragon Cult. It was either during or soon after the move to Tamriel that the Dragon Cult became more malevolent and forced its will throughout the land. It took the Dragon War to overthrow the Dragons and their priests, but that's a tale for another time.\n\nEventually, the animal-totem gods transformed into the eight gods we worship today. We call them by their true names: Alduin, Kyne, Mara, Dibella, Stuhn, Jhunal, Orkey, and Shor. We understand that our gods are as cyclical as the world itself, so we also remember the Dead Gods (Shor and Tsun) who fought and died to bring about the current world, the Hearth Gods (Kyne, Mara, Dibella, Stuhn, and Jhunal) who watch over the present cycle, and the Twilight God (Alduin) who ushers in the next cycle. Add to these our so-called Testing Gods, who we do not worship but instead guard against to protect the hearth. These include Orkey, Mauloch, and Herma-Mora.\n\nWhen the Imperials arrived, they brought with them their southern religion and worked to unify the worship of the Eight Divines. That's how we got this wonderful Temple of the Divines that graces our fair city of Solitude. We agree with the general notion that there are eight gods, more or less, but we view them quite differently and call them by different names. Our temple has adjusted to the needs and desires of the current rulers time and again, yet we have grown used to some of the more prominent Imperial notions and practices even though we no longer find ourselves beholden to the Ruby Throne.\n\nProbably our biggest difference relates to the head of the pantheon. We Nords consider Kyne as the leader of the gods and find the Imperial fascination with Alduin (who they call Akatosh) to be both perplexing and mildly disturbing. We work diligently to keep Alduin asleep, while our southern neighbors try time and time again to get his attention! Which is why I begin every service in the temple with a prayer to praise Alduin (oh great god of time!), followed by a prayer to keep him at bay (may your slumber stretch on for a thousand generations!)."

To this day, it is regarded as one of the most difficult instruments to master.\n\nOver the centuries, it was most often used for hazing than playing—at one point senior students would tell fledgling bards that they should take up the vossa-satl, as it was easy to learn and certain notes would make any Argonian swoon in their favor. If it didn't make the right sound, it was because they weren't blowing with enough spittle.\n\nBards College staff did eventually put a stop to this, and this particular instrument was taken up with pride as the favorite of the current Adjunct Professor of Argonian Music Theory, Twains-the-Night."
