Sure, the villagers say that their friends and family members have gone missing, but my father says they probably just left to avoid the plague. Oh, right, and then there's the Llodos plague, but I'm not too worried about that, either. My father's the House Minister! He won't let anyone that's part of House Hlaalu get sick, especially not his darling daughter. (That's me!)\n\nI saw a recruiting pamphlet for the Maulborn today. They were distributing them outside the gates of town. They say they're here to help, but I think there's something creepy about them. And I certainly don't like the outfits they make all their members wear. It's like they're some kind of an army or something. Still, there were a couple of cute-looking members wandering around down by the lake. I wonder what they like to do for fun when they're not saving the world? Maybe I'll sneak down there one night and take a look.\n\nThere's a stranger in town. Finally, someone interesting to talk to! I can't wait to talk to the stranger. Hear about news from distant lands, listen to stories of thrilling adventures and forbidden romance. Maybe my father will let me invite the stranger over for dinner. That would be exciting! But it would be more exciting if we could go somewhere quiet, just the two of us. I need to think about that. I'm sure I can work out a way to make that happen.\n\nI'll tell you all about it next time, Diary!\n\n— Vim Hlaalu"

msgid "I've decided to embrace my recent acceptance into the Tribunal Temple as an apprentice historian by cataloging my own experiences on this journey. Maybe it's vain, but I like the idea of some anthropologist in the far future learning even just a bit more about the lives we live because I took the time to jot down my thoughts and feelings. I could probably fill this journal with just what's racing through my head at this moment, so I'll just say that ""elated"" doesn't begin to describe it.\n—\nThere's so much history here. Thousands of years' worth of relics and texts outlining the history of our people back before Saint Veloth lead us to holy Resdayn. It's not so neat as all that, of course, it's thousands of pieces of the puzzle all strewn and scattered, in need of a guiding hand to fit it all together. It's almost overwhelming. I'm so honored that I get to be part of piecing it all together.\n—\nI must sound like a great fool to Tythis. Always rambling on about the implications of some small fragment of kwama shell's significance to the agrarian development of our early settlements. But he smiles regardless. I like to think he still wears that smile underneath his mask.\n—\nSo much of the Temple's attention goes into the building of the holy city. It's important work, I know, but expeditions of historical sites are practically non-existent these days. The Master Historian has begun accepting relics brought to us by treasure hunters. I have reservations about encouraging laymen to plunder tombs. Can we be certain these treasures really came from unclaimed ruins? What delicate clues did these enterprising adventurers destroy in their reckless hunt for valuables? It's not my place to question the Master Historian though, he knows far far more about these matters than I do.\n—\nA find! Oh, what a find! A band of relic hunters braved some of the worst of the Ashlands and returned with a statue like nothing I've ever seen. The Master Historian's eyes widened two-fold at the sight of it. I'd never seen him react so obviously to anything, really, and he assigned its study to me! I'm honored he entrusts me with something of such obvious significance. I must have really impressed him with my report on the Dwemeri influence on Chimer garb in the latter half of the Merethic Era. I can't wait to tell Tythis.\n—\nSometimes I forget my brother is an Ordinator. The moment I mentioned the new find he was practically interrogating me. Now that I'm involved in something groundbreaking, he's suddenly interested in hearing the details. He's so protective sometimes. I think his position only makes it worse. I assured him that the Master Historian would never expose me to anything dangerous. I'm sure he'll be supervising my study closely anyway.\n—\nCare to guess who got their own private study? Why am I posing myself rhetorical questions? Please disregard that future anthropologists. It was me, by the way. The Master Historian wanted to ensure I was kept away from any distractions while I began my study of the relic. He gave me some encouraging words before leaving me to my work, but I could tell he was nervous. He's taking a great risk leaving this find to a novice. I have to prove that his faith in me was not misplaced.\n—\nI think there's some jealousy among the historians. I catch a few side-long glances when heading to my study these days and I swear I can hear them whispering just out of earshot. I can't make out what they're saying, but I can guess. I hope we're beyond that kind of pettiness by the time anyone reads this. I've managed to brush away most of the caked ash that was obscuring the details of the statue. It's a much more advanced piece of art than we see from Ashlander tribes. The tool work alone implies access to metalworking facilities. The symbols adorning the body aren't familiar to me though.\n—\nI found some old reference to a settlement called Kogoruhn that was roughly near where the statue was found, but much of the pages describing it were marked out. I asked permission from the Master Historian to see the restricted texts, but he told me to focus on the statue. He promised to bring me the relevant texts when he had the chance. For now, I think I'll start taking rubbings of the statue. I'll have to close the door tonight. The others are getting bolder in their spying and the sotto voce is becoming distracting.\n—\nI know what it is. I know what I am. The naked stone in my hands was electric. Jolting me awake and out of the hollow stupor I was cursed to live through all this time. The Temple thinks it can bury the truth, but the only ones they are blinding are themselves. Our legacy lives on. Our House will be made whole again. It's been calling to me all this time, I just couldn't hear it.\n—\nThe old man's footsteps approach. Here to deliver more of his lies and cover up the great betrayal at the heart of this false Temple. He will pay for his crimes against us. I've wasted enough time in the thrall of these deceivers. Home is calling."

She was supplying various clients throughout the Gold Coast, including her own Red Sails Pirates and the Gold Coast Trading Company.

Curse my avaricious eyes!\n\nWe were off the coast of Glenumbra when a whale of a storm blew in. As my ship and crew were tossed about like so many dice in a cup, the wamasu decided she no longer cared for our generous hospitality. The damned creature shattered her crate like so much drift wood. Then she crashed through the hold and woe be to any of my sailors who happened to be in the way. But it didn't stop there! The hateful beast ate my ship! Beams splintered and planks snapped in the wake of her unbridled fury. I meant to go down with my doomed vessel, but fate had another idea in mind.\n\nI awoke floating just off shore on a chunk of debris. The wreckage of my ship was all around me, but I didn't see another living soul. No one, that is, except for the damned wamasu. It made its way to shore and immediately set about making a nest and laying eggs. Well, I'm never going to see Fortunata's gold and the wamasu is never going to see the Gold Coast.

msgid "|acTHE CHORROL CRIER\nIssue 21\nMorning Star, 579\n\n|alGreetings to my loyal readers. Here's what happened in town since Issue 20:\n\nSeems that everyone has recovered from the New Life Festival, though Verene continues to celebrate.\n\nDarvell is at it again. He passed out several times near the Oak and Crosier this month. He claims not to have been drinking but overcome by fumes from the ground. Darvell insists that there's something underground, something only he can sense. Fumes indeed; poor Vanny!\n\nThe Quickstep Bandits struck again, stealing hay and rope from Zegol's storehouse. That should improve Zegol's ever-sunny disposition, no?\n\nPrefect Doran swears she'll do something about the clamor of the merchants around Little Oak Place. The constant bickering over display space must end. Something needs to be done to cut down on the merchants in town. Porcia should have Domitius throw out every other one.\n\n*******************************\n\n|acTHE CHORROL CRIER\nIssue 23\nSun's Height, 579\n\n|alApologies to my readers—the events of the last months have prevented me from writing the Crier. But now I resume my duties.\n\nThe upheavals in Chorrol, both personal and physical, continue. The quakes never stop while the chasm grows ever wider and its list of victims longer. I can't bear to name all those we lost during the cataclysm. Every family has suffered. A walk through town highlights the missing more than the still-present.\n\nStill no explanation for the upheaval. Folks here call it the ""Sundering."" Darvell insists that he smelled the chasm before Chorrol was torn asunder. He's acting even odder than before, if that's possible.\n\nWhen Prefect Doran was taken by a creature from the chasm, we looked to Domitius for leadership, but he refused. I have taken up the role, until someone else wants it. I sent Ethyan and Larian to the Imperial City, to see if more is known of these events. And to request aid for our ruined town.\n\n*******************************\n\n|acTHE CHORROL CRIER\nIssue 24\nHearthfire, 579\n\n|alAs most know, Ethyan and Larian returned from their journey last week. None of the news was good. They didn't make it to the city. The bridges are gone and monsters roam the banks of Lake Rumare. Our scouts heard rumors from refugees fleeing the city. No aid is coming; the city lies in ruins.\n\nThe cataclysm that split Chorrol in half also devastated the Imperial City. Some say it originated there. Larian reports the city folk called it the ""Soulburst,"" though none knew why.\n\nEmperor Varen is missing. Some say he died in the upheaval, others that he was just badly injured. Maybe it was his soul that burst? The Five Companions are all missing as well. Some say that Sai Sahan killed the emperor and stole the Amulet of Kings. Others claim it was Lyris. Only confusion reigns in the Imperial City now.\n\nAnd in Chorrol as well. Creatures of flame lurk in the chasm now, seizing any who venture near. Fumes from the fiery depths have caused several Chorrolians to pass out while crossing the bridge and topple to their deaths. At least the fumes and monsters have chased away the merchants who used to infest Little Oak Place. I suspect we'll miss them in the months to come though.\n\n*******************************\n\n|acTHE CHORROL CRIER\nIssue 25\nFirst Seed, 580\n\n|alIt's been many months since my last issue. I don't seem to have the energy for it anymore. I'll try to be better.\n\nChorrol teeters on the edge. Quakes shake the town almost every day. Our homes fall down around us. The chasm almost feels like part of the town now. It's hard to remember what Chorrol was like without it.\n\nMany have left. Those who remain either have nowhere else to go or are too stubborn to give up. We're all just hanging on, waiting for we know not what.\n\nNowhere else is any better. They say the Tharns have seized control of the Empire, though they control little more than the city and Lake Rumare's environs. Clivia Tharn is now Empress Regent; may the she-wolf choke on the title.\n\nArmed gangs roam the countryside, Imperial Army deserters gone bad. True soldiers are rarely seen, as they hide in their keeps. Rumors of war with the barbarian nations outside Cyrodiil are heard every day. They smell the Empire's weakness and look to conquer the jewel of Tamriel. The gods help us all.\n\n*******************************\n\n|acTHE CHORROL CRIER\nFinal Issue\nSun's Dusk, 580\n\n|alSorry, but I can't do this anymore. This is the last issue of the Crier, unless someone else takes it up.\n\nI keep hoping things will get better, but they only get worse. Each quake brings another piece of my house down and slides it a little closer to the chasm. I keep expecting it to fall in any day. When it does, I'll go with it. Ethyan does his best, but the house is more patches than holes now.\n\nArmies march past the town, sometimes right through it. Never the Imperial Army, always troops from the Covenant or Dominion. Food is scarce, crops stolen or trampled by the invaders. We're slowly starving here.\n\nNo place else to go. War is everywhere. Bandits pillage at will. Travelers tell of monsters roaming the countryside. The few merchants who made it here are too scared to leave. Not that they have much to sell.\n\nWho can fix this? It can't be fixed. This is the way things are now, until we die. The gods have left Cyrodiil. I wish you all luck, but you won't find it."

We just want to live our lives in peace, and as far away from the Dunmeri slavers as possible.\n\n*****\nI haven't had a chance to write, we've been constantly on the move for so long now. It feels like months but I know its only been a few weeks. We attempted to establish a town on the edge of Cyrodiil but we were chased out by a group of Imperial Scouts—apparently some large battle was about to take place. My feet are sore but we must keep walking if we wish to find a new home.\n\n*****\nWe've made our way to Valenwood, to an area called Grahtwood. The Wood Elves seem friendly here. We heard there was trouble in the north, but we've seen none of it.\n\n*****\nI can't believe this is happening! We've been given a piece of land by the Wood Elves. In return, we will give some of the fish we catch to them. Finally, a home where we can live in peace.\n\n*****\nForest-Child has taken an interest in me lately and I must say, it's most welcome.

The Wood Elves were fighting each other, but now they aren't. The High Elves sailed here in great ships and stopped the fighting. Now they are meeting in <<1>>. None of this has changed life in <<Ac:2>>.\n\n*****\nSoldiers from this new ""Dominion"" arrived recently. We thought they were just passing through, but it looks like they are setting up camp outside our town. We can't get anything out of them. Whenever anyone asks what they are doing they reply it's none of our business. But they're leaving us alone, so we continue to fish.\n\n*****\nThe soldiers put up gates and tall walls around our town this morning. It's starting to feel like Black Marsh all over again. We refused to join the Ebonheart Pact because we would have had to live side-by-side with the Dunmeri slavers that took away so many years of our lives. And now, when we thought we finally found a new home among the Wood Elves, the high and mighty Mer deem us unworthy. I thought that Slim-Jah was overreacting. She said the Dominion's arrival would mean our destruction. I'm starting to believe she is right."

msgid "It's been nearly two months since we arrived in the Port of Haven and I'm still not certain we belong here. The Wood Elves initially welcomed us—or, at least, our trade goods—but fewer and fewer of them come into the city every week. Our import trade has declined such that Linduure is talking about heading inland, perhaps to Brackenleaf or even Elden Root to drum up business. I don't like the idea of her going into the wilds alone, but she assures me the roads are safe and other traders and merchants have done the same.\n\n*****\nA ship arrived yesterday, restocking for the voyage to Khenarthi's Roost. There're rumors of a larger Dominion fleet headed to the Khajiiti island later on this month. I hope so. That one, small scout vessel bought up most of our supplies in one go! Linduure wants to restock the shop and see what happens. Maybe she'll stop talking about traveling alone into the interior.\n\n*****\nThe first few ships from the fleet arrived just this morning, and Haven is bustling with activity! General Endare's troops have been pressed into service to help the city guard maintain order. I've heard rumors of smugglers trying to find their way past the customs agents around the fort, but unless they want to brave the swamp or somehow find their way under or around the walls, they're out of luck! Our resupply came in not a moment too soon!\n\n*****\nThe excitement of Fleet Day has ebbed and Haven feels particularly empty again. Almost none of the Wood Elves who first came to see the ""great stone city"" have returned, and those few who remain aren't interested in our wares. Linduure and I have been arguing again about her proposed trip inland. I say we should stock up and wait for another Fleet Day—the ships have to return from Khenarthi's Roost sometime—but she says we can't count on that. Once the treaty is signed, she says, there won't be armadas sailing to and fro … just small traders. I'm not so certain.\n\n*****\nAnother windfall today! General Endare is taking her Jade Dragoons inland. The innkeeper says she's been asking around about some of the ancient Ayleid sites in Grahtwood. I don't know why she's going herself, but her troops have been stockpiling rations all morning. We're nearly sold out again!\n\n*****\nNow that the soldiers are gone, the Port feels even more empty—and a bit bare. We've seen sails off the coast, but just ships passing by. I can tell Linduure is itching to do something, but we've made so much profit in the last month that I can't believe she thinks the trip is worth the risk.\n\n*****\nTurns out my wife is more headstrong than I thought. She insists on investing our newfound wealth. She's purchased a pair of wagons, some guar, and she's even hired a Wood Elf jaqspur and some mercenaries as guards. It's off to Brackenleaf and Elden Root for her. I guess I shouldn't be nervous. General Endare marched her dragoons up the same road less than a week ago. Any bandits out there should be thoroughly cowed.\n\n*****\nLinduure's been gone two days now and things in Haven haven't picked up. I'm hoping we see some incoming sails soon—not just for the trade, but for the activity. The city gets hot in the summer, and most everyone, guards and merchants alike, gets lazy without any visitors. I found myself napping out by the well today for over an hour.\n\n*****\nAt last! Some commotion over at the fort. I think a ship came in early this morning. I'm going to load up the hand-cart with a few samples and head down to the pier. Perhaps the newcomers have money to spend!"

msgid "By Serinal Gane, Royal Scribe of Shornhelm\n\nHistory is written by the victors, so I have no doubt as to how King Ranser will be remembered. But my job has always been to keep King Ranser's records, and that hasn't changed—at least in my mind—with our new state of being. I'm getting ahead of myself. My pardons. Allow me to start at the beginning.\n\nAfter almost a year of conflict, Emeric and his allies had driven King Ranser's forces to the brink of defeat. We prepared to make our final stand at Markwasten Moor, caught as we were between a Breton armada and Orc troops. I am sure that history will describe how King Ranser fell that day, but history would be wrong. An entirely different fate befell the liege of Wayrest.\n\nIt is true that the bulk of King Ranser's army was annihilated at the battle on the moor. But Ranser was able to escape with a small contingent of soldiers and aides and make his way to the top of a nameless tor overlooking the shattered city of Shornhelm.\n\nIt was on this tor that King Ranser put his ultimate plan into motion to defeat King Emeric and his dastardly allies. Using an arcane ritual provided by the court magician, Reezal-Jul, the brilliant King Ranser transformed his most loyal and devoted soldiers into a force that would stand for the ages. The final step in the ritual required a blood sacrifice, however. When King Ranser's traitorous general—whose name shall never again be spoken and who shall forever be forgotten—murdered his own liege, it was royal blood that ignited the ritual and triggered our change.\n\nI must admit that my less-than-regal mind has yet to fully fathom the intricacies of King Ranser's plan. His ritual turned us all into undead soldiers, skeletal immortals who can stand at his side for eternity. But instead of immediately striking out and attacking Emeric's forces, King Ranser ordered us to strengthen our position and prepare to defend the tor.\n\n""This tor shall be my throne!"" King Ranser proclaimed. ""From here, I shall rule for eternity!""\n\nAnd now you know the true fate of King Ranser and his loyal soldiers. My time as scribe is finished, for my liege needs every sword at the ready. I will leave this record, safe in this tower until the day comes that King Ranser orders us to march from the tor and back into Shornhelm."

msgid "The biggest challenge in the construction of Marbruk was bringing the stone into Valenwood. The Wood Elves have few quarries, and the forest in these parts is so overgrown, the ground so fertile, that it's difficult to find quality deposits. In addition, Queen Ayrenn expressly commanded that we disturb as little of Valenwood to build the city as possible. \n\nInterestingly, Wood Elves from outside Valenwood and from the bigger settlements, such as Woodhearth, have objected more strenuously to Marbruk's construction than the local Wood Elves, who are mostly fascinated by the stone constructions rising up among them. If I had to guess, I'd say that the symbolic importance of Valenwood is greater for those who don't live there than for those who do. It's as if these more ""civilized"" Wood Elves fear they've already compromised their culture in some way, so they feel obligated to protest the construction. \n\nQueen Ayrenn has assured both parties of Wood Elves that Marbruk is necessary to the defense of the Wood Elf way of life, especially against the Ebonheart Pact, and so far this assurance seems to have prevented any serious interference with our work, although there has been the occasional incident of tools going missing or stone being carved into perverse shapes overnight."

msgid "After visiting Cousin Idirfa in Fort Amol, I decided to take the family to visit Icehammer's Vault. My intention was to leave my wife and child outside the tomb while I went in to collect whatever gold and relics I could carry. I'm a fairly good treasure hunter, if I do say so myself, but those moneylenders are making it difficult for me and my family. I need to collect enough treasure to pay off the moneylenders before things get ugly.\n\n***\nI survived my first foray into the vault. I had to dispatch one draugr I wasn't able to sneak past, but at least a found a small coffer that contained a few pieces of gold. Nowhere near enough to pay off my debts, but a good start nevertheless. \n\nWhen I returned to our camp, I saw that the weather had taken a turn for the worse. My poor wife was freezing and the baby wasn't doing much better. I couldn't leave them out in the elements, but it was also too treacherous to try to travel. My only choice was to take them with me back into Icehammer's Vault.\n\n***\nAt least it's relatively warm and dry within the tomb. And the hunting has been going well. A few more days and I might actually have enough to pay my debts with a little left to spare! \n\nThe draugr are becoming more and more of a problem, however. They seem to be searching the tomb for us. I know that sounds crazy. They are mindless walking corpses, after all. But it really seems like they're making a concerted effort to find us. \n\nDamn the weather! The storm raging outside is still too intense for us to chance—and I really should collect a few more items from these burial chambers. One more night, and then I'm getting my family out of here.\n\n***\nWhat a fool I was! A complete and utter fool! While I was rooting around in one of the burial chambers, a horde of draugr broke through the barricade I had set up and attacked my poor, poor wife. I can see that she died valiantly, trying to defend our child from the monsters. For all the good it did! Now both my wife and baby are dead, and I am alone in this cursed vault! \n\nI saw another exit down a deserted corridor. I'll try to avoid the draugr and escape through there."

msgid "by Gwilgoth Branchbreaker\n\nPart Three: A Treethane's Dilemma\n\nLoyalty, prized by friends and demanded of subordinates, must still be tempered with flexibility. Otherwise, loyalty is a trap, and a dangerous one.\n\nTake, for example, the story of the former Treethane of Silvenar, Thalrinel. I served her loyally for her entire, if short, stint as custodian of the city, just as she served our lordships, and even the Aldmeri Dominion loyally during her term.\n\nBut when the Hound, Lord Ulthorn, arrived, he declared a new order, and his men enforced loyalty to the Bosmer first. Naturally, I saw the immediate wisdom of the Hound's position.\n\nUnfortunately, Thalrinel did not. She resisted his welcome ascendance as the Green Lady's consort, and her misplaced loyalty was rewarded with nothing but pain. She fancied herself a representative of the Silvenar, an archaic symbol of outdated oaths, not a representative of Silvenar, a city full of mer who needed her loyalty.\n\nFortunately, I saw the wisdom in Lord Ulthorn's reasoning. And the Hound saw the benefits of my flexibility. He promised my ascendance to treethane if I would back him and help complete the inevitable union between the Green Lady and himself.\n\nWhat could I do? The fate of the city was in the balance. When she arrived, I welcomed her and gave her the drink and food set aside for her by Lord Ulthorn. I'm certain he knew what was best.\n\nAll was going well until the Silvenar arrived. The Houndsmen were prepared, and I'm certain this business of ""heroes"" and ""villains"" will be resolved in our favor. My loyalty cannot be questioned. I'm certain Lord Ulthorn will remember me in the end.\n\nIf only I could—"

Gloorig, that upstart, called my daughter <<1>> pathetic and weak! \n\nI struck him; his blood flowed for nearly an hour. <<1>> is as strong as a mammoth! Only the Code of Mauloch keeps her from surpassing me as chief.\n\nGloorig may usurp my hold if I leave. No matter.

I hesitate to sully my daughter's blood with this Elf-swill.\n\n<<3>>'s leaves are poisonous, but its petals are a powerful curative.

msgid "2E 582\n\nI've finished delivering that shipment of ingots to Orsinium. The stories are true. No matter how many times this city gets razed or sacked or burned to the ground, our brothers and sisters rebuild it better and tougher than ever before.\n\nIt's been thirty-nine years since King Emeric gave us Wrothgar and Orsinium back. I've learned that an army of Orc crafters can do a stupid amount of work in thirty-nine years. And it's none of that ornamental Breton crap, either. It's good solid stonework built to hold up the next time the Bretons and Redguards decide they'd rather just kill us all and try to raze our home to the ground.\n\nEvery time I'm back home, everything I do just feels right. If you haven't been, then I'll say it like this: it's not Daggerfall. \n\nEveryone knows where everyone stands in Orsinium. The Bretons in Daggerfall always think I'm on my way to a battlefield. If I hear ""Are you a soldier?"" one more damn time, I'm gonna show them the heavy end of my hammer. If we act like beasts, it's because half the humans in that town talk to us like we're big dumb beasts.\n\nThe other half get really quiet when I'm around. I don't honestly think they fear me. They couldn't possibly think I'm there to kill them and eat their children. They should know I'm there to do business. I'm a blacksmith and stonemason and I'm there to make some coin. Despite that, no one there is really honest about how they feel about Orcs.\n\nAs soon as I'm back in the heart of Wrothgar, walking between those solid stone walls, everything changes. It's honest there. Not like Daggerfall. There's no fawning or bowing or scraping or Breton poetry: when you talk to someone, they say what they mean. When you look at someone, and he's got a problem with you, you know it. And if I've got a problem with someone, I can punch him in the face without knowing someone's going to call the city guard on me. We settle it. You know what I mean.\n\nDo you remember the last time you were in a little Orc stronghold? Do you remember the last time you talked to some chieftain with his fat ass on a throne and all his wives scurrying around him? A chief's first wife—every time, I swear, no matter where I go—she sizes me up from her first look. She's got to figure out which Orc traveler or merchant or crafter is going to be the one to bring down her husband and tear down everything she knows. She's a big slaughterfish in a little muddy pond, circling you over and over again.\n\nYou don't get that in Orsinium. Ever. There's a whole school of slaughterfish baring their teeth at each other, so really, you don't have to worry about some scheming chieftain's wife. Everyone who hates you shows it. You know it.\n\nAnd the food. Damn! The food! No one in Daggerfall knows how to butcher an animal properly. Maybe their cooks just hate doing it. The farther you travel from Orsinium, the worse it gets: humans overcook their food, so it lacks that savory flavor you get from juice and blood. And nothing crunches properly. You know how it goes.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I make a lot of money in Daggerfall, but Orsinium is a real city. It's as honest as a stone wall, it's as brutal as a hailstorm, and no matter what they burn or bash or smash, it will never ever really die. \n\nOrsinium is home. It's always good to be back."

They all look like churches, with spires and arches and such. I bet Brother Cantrall would love it.\n\n<Nicolene has sketched one of the Dark Elf towers. It's quite good.

I kind of miss him, though.\n\n\n28 Sun's Height\n\nWe landed in Skywatch today. Captain Kaleen took me ashore! I thought the Dark Elves were crazy, but the High Elves build like they want to prove something. You can't take two steps without seeing some crazy spire thing. They're nuts.\n\n<Nicolene sketched a bunch of towers here, all in a row. They might be made of crystal.>\n\nGall and pox, the High Elves are so snooty! I could tell the motherless sods didn't want to deal with the captain, but in five minutes she had them eating from her hand. She's amazing.\n\nI wanted to see more of the city, but the sodding Elves are really picky about outsiders, so we had to stay on the docks. But we spent the whole day together! I took notes and carried her stuff.\n\n\n4 Last Seed\n\nWe got attacked! Master Kasan said it was a Dunmer slave ship. They had mages on the decks, throwing giant fireballs at us. It was terrifying!\n\nOne of the masts caught on fire, but Tumma-Shah climbed up and put it out. The captain turned us into the wind, laughing like it was all a game. They couldn't keep up. Mara, how does she do it?\n\nI was shaking so bad after. Kasan has told me horrible things about Dark Elf slavers. I think some of his family are still in Morrowind. I wonder if he misses them.\n\nAnyway, this is the best part. After we were safe, the captain saw me shaking and took me aside. She told me I was brave and did well. Then she hugged me. Hugged me!\n\nMara, I'm still tingly. It felt so good!\n\n\n8 Last Seed\n\nAs soon as we put into Daggerfall again, I'm going to take all my savings and buy some new clothes. Something nice and proper, something the captain will like.\n\nI asked Tumma-Shah if Kaleen's ever been married. She just flicked her tongue at me, but I bet not. Kaleen's too strong and independent to marry some stupid man, just like me."
