msgid "Dearest Nabor,\n\nI know that you probably hate me. You certainly hate what I've chosen to do to you. I don't begrudge you those feelings, but it's only right that I explain why I'm doing what I'm doing. You must know that I do not torment you needlessly. I hope that brings you some measure of solace.\n\nThe fact is that I need what you have. Life and vigor specifically. I cannot take it from the Pyre Watch without alerting them to our presence. I cannot take it from the bones of the Host, since they have no vigor left to give. That leaves you, Nabor. Reliable, vigorous, sturdy Nabor. \n\nNow, you may experience something akin to hunger—an inexplicable craving that comes from somewhere other than the belly. I will be honest: that hunger will only grow, and you will struggle to bear it. What I take from you must be replenished, you see. You may strip the strength from any living creatures that stray too close. It matters little to me. Just know that I will not stop taking what I require until my work is complete—until my creation walks these halls, perfected.\n\nThis creature—our child—will bring new meaning to the dark practice. No undead creature will compare to its glory. You play an instrumental role in this achievement, Nabor. When the pangs of hunger and pain become unbearable, think on that.\n\nYours,\nVoria"

All the ransacked tombs, all the overturned sarcophagi, all the killing, and sleepless nights, and empty promises paid for in blood—all of it leads to this.\n\nNone of my compatriots know the true nature of this place. They slaver over the trinkets we're bound to find, and they whisper about our mysterious employer; but to them, this is just another grave. I know better. The Redguards buried these ashes here for a reason. Something evil dwelt here already. Something impossibly powerful.

I found only one: Tzirzhalir, the nightmare behemoth. When I reach the heart of this place, I will call him by name. When we ascend from this cavernous prison, no one will forget that name. Or mine."

I never would have guessed that the superstitious Redguards would stash the Gray Hosts' remains in a Yokudan ruin! A delicious irony considering how much they detest the undead.\n\nI needn't move too quietly. These Pyre Watch guards are easily distracted, and few venture beyond the gates. Indeed, it seems I have the grave all to myself! Raising these fallen vampires shouldn't take long. An army of bone is finally within my grasp!\n\n3rd of Second Seed, 1E 1092\n\nI find myself hopelessly lost. The Pyre Watch placed powerful wards on many of the doors in this place, making a return to the entrance impossible. So, I venture deeper.\n\n5th of Second Seed, 1E 1092\n\nMy provisions run low, and I remain adrift in this maze of caverns and ash. I had hoped to raise an army of servants before I committed to my transformative ritual, but it seems I must accelerate the process. \nFunny. I hold the phylactery in my hand. I have the reagents in my possession. But now, at the critical moment of choice, I find myself hesitating. It must be the hunger. I've spent decades preparing for my ascension to lichdom. I cannot stop now even if I wanted to. Hesitation means starvation. I will begin the ritual at once.\n\n6th of Second Seed, 1E 1092\n\nSuccess. I think. Difficult to write. I feel a shaking in my heart. Always. My hands tremble at the slightest thought. Something is amiss. This will pass. It must pass.\n\n8th of Second Seed, 1E 1092\n\nAt long last, the shaking passed. But now I find myself unable to concentrate. I spend long hours gazing at the stone, imagining what it might look like painted, or pondering its composition. I conducted the ritual exactly as prescribed. My mind will clear in time. I'm sure of it.\n\n22nd Midyear, 1E 1092\n\nWhy does no one write? Why does no one visit? Here I sit in these grand halls of stone and ash conversing with myself. Myself, of all people! What have we to talk about, myself and I? The same old stories? The same stale jests? I must find a companion. I must!\n\n????\n\nI found this book. It says it's mine, but is it? I don't recognize the handwriting. I don't recall the events. Perhaps it's a prank. Yes, yet another prank to make me look like a fool. I'll show them—those voices that laugh behind the walls at all hours of the night. Or is it day? Perhaps it's both. Or Neither.\n\n????\n\nA book! A book! A book that I can write in! The journal of Ondagore? What a miserable author. Complaints! Laments! Bah! I'm sure this person had it better than I! I don't mind solitude—I don't! But a visitor would be welcome. Maybe. It depends on their manner, yes? Their deportment? Someone will come calling eventually. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.\n\n<indecipherable text fills the rest of the journal.>"

msgid "By Associate Zanon\n\nThis thesis is the result of three hundred and seventy disassemblies and reconstructions of skeevaton fabricants throughout the\n\n<I omitted the next seven plates of droning introduction. You'd think metal engraving would encourage brevity.>\n\nStandard Functionality\n\nIdentifier: Unless removed, all skeevatons possess a sensory tool more sophisticated than their basic auditory and visual equipment. Mounted on a telescoping rod, the Identifier sends out pulses of detection magic to survey objects of interest and search within specific parameters.\n\n<This was the only noteworthy device in the standard design. Unless you're fascinated by scent interpreters.>\n\nSkeevaton Modification\n\nSkeevatons are found throughout Clockwork City, even in extremely hazardous environments. Tinkerers have managed to get around the weaknesses of the fabricant's diminutive size by incorporating some offensive and defensive devices.\n\nGear Shifting: One of the most common modifications I've encountered involves a secondary set of motility gears meant to increase the skeevaton's speed in short bursts. Certainly useful when they need to traverse the inner workings of active machinery.\n\n<Simple enough, but weight will be a limiting factor.>\n\nEnergy Absorption: Skeevatons are sometimes fitted with a micro-magicka condenser allowing them to temporarily store and transport energy without a charged soul gem. The practical uses for this are theoretically limitless, but retaining a powerful magical charge provides some defensive uses as well.\n\nDischarge Energy: A fully charged micro-magicka condenser can release its volatile payload in an emergency, sending raw Destruction magic erupting in all directions. This should be done only under desperate circumstances or safe conditions as the blast can easily overload active constructs.\n\nDeploy-able Barrier: While skeevatons with reinforced chassis are more common, one of the more effective defenses I've discovered is a form of emitted barrier that the skeevaton can project over a sizable radius, allowing it to protect not only itself, but other vulnerable objects as well.\n\nShock Chassis: A few mischief makers and would-be saboteurs have outfitted skeevatons with dangerous modifications that generate a powerful destructive shock through the fabricant's exterior. This jolt is painful to living things and fry animunculi.\n\nRestoration Emitter: While most skeevatons are equipped with physical tools to conduct repairs, one ingenious model incorporated a modification that generated a restorative magical field around the skeevaton that mended distressed metal, dissipated residual heat, stabilized energy emissions, and other processes used to maintain smooth operation.\n\n<These modifications are marvelous, but there simply isn't enough room in a skeevaton to incorporate everything. I'll need to decide what's best tailored to certain roles.>\n\nTrans-corporeal Operation: While most skeevatons I have reverse engineered have operated autonomously to carry out simple or routine tasks, I encountered several that had been tinkered with to allow an individual direct control over the fabricant. These modifications ranged from cumbersome wires, resembling a puppeteer's strings, and hand-held tonal emitters to a trans-corporeal pneumeria chamber that allows a being to inhabit the fabricant itself! This modified Dwemer device ingeniously converts a being into pure Liminal energy and stores it within a hermetic chamber. When connected to a fabricant the intelligence of the occupant may operate the fabricant as an extension of their animus. Obviously, this allows for unprecedented precision of control, but it also carries immense risk. If the skeevaton were to suffer a catastrophic failure while the pneumeria chamber was occupied, the animus would be violently ejected and almost certainly kill the occupant, if they even rematerialized at all.\n\n<I wouldn't have thought to use a pneumeria chamber to contain metaphysical material, but I shouldn't be surprised. Tonal devices often blur the lines between material and immaterial. I can think of a few uses for this.>"

msgid "I found a partial account of a long-range Ayleid raid upon Mzulft that mentioned the Wrathstone at least nine times. The conflict revolved around the artifact, which is odd since by the Dwemers' own account it was not within the city and the timing is all off. Why would the Ayleids attack the Dwemer while their empire was in the midst of a slave rebellion?\n\n* * *\nMzulft was plagued by conflict in the years surrounding that account. The city repelled attacks from the Nords, Ayleids, and even neighboring Dwemer clans. Were they all after the Wrathstone?\n\n* * *\nThe great Dwemer architect, Mhuvnak, disappeared from Mzulft around this time. The prevailing theory is that he was a casualty of war, but from what I've found, there's no reason to believe Mzulft suffered any significant losses before the Nords sacked it during the reign of High King Gellir.\n\n* * *\nI have it! Kagrenzel. Mhuvnak departed for Kagrenzel after the Ayleid raid. He'd have no reason to leave the safety of the city for a small holdout in the mountains unless there was something important there. Tomorrow I make for Eastmarch.\n\n* * *\nAnother setback. The pair of Nords I hired as an escort fell, quite literally, into a death trap almost immediately. This place reminds me more of Yokudan tombs than Dwemer remnants. It seems like its entire purpose is to kill those who would search it.\n\n* * *\nAfter a very cautious search of Kagrenzel, I'm confident that the Wrathstone is not here. My current theory is that Mhuvnak came here to retrieve it. For all its devious designs, this place is best suited for catching thieves, not rebuffing an army. Mhuvnak must not have trusted the defenses to protect the artifact from his rivals.\n\n* * *\nMhuvnak was the most brilliant architect of his time. I don't believe someone as meticulous as he was to just take the Wrathstone and run off without a plan. Mzulft may have more answers.\n\n* * *\nI decided to forgo an escort this time. I don't have much luck with them and I'll need to take my time searching Mzulft for answers. Unsurprisingly, animunculi still roam the halls continuing their duties in an unbroken circuit for all time. I hear things though, echoing from deep in the ruins. Muffled clatter and animal shrieks. Something is keeping the constructs occupied, and that's a benefit to me, for now.\n\n* * *\nI'm running out of paper to contain my notes on Mzulft thus far, and I've only scratched the surface of this city. Most scholars would be content to spend their lives unraveling the secrets of this place, but I have my sights set higher than most. No more distractions. Find what I can about Mhuvnak and where he may have escaped to.\n\n* * *\nThere is an observatory of sorts in Mzulft, dominated by a device that fills the room. I've never seen anything like it. I didn't think Dwemer were known for their appreciation of the world above them, let alone the sky.\n\n* * *\nThere are surviving writings here. Not from the time of Mhuvnak, but long after. The Dwemer reclaimed Mzulft from the Nords and were thriving before their ultimate disappearance. This device, the Oculory, could observe the world with frightening acuity, when it worked. The Dwemer were using it to locate the lost Vault of Mhuvnak, but the ""Frostvault"" is buried in a mountain of ice. I've found no record of an attempt to reclaim it for their kingdom.\n\n* * *\nIf I've interpreted things correctly, I believe I know where the Frostvault may be found; however, I'm running low on funds. Quintus's estate was more debt than assets and if I'm to see this through I can't afford to be wrong.\n\n* * *\nI'm on the right path, I'm sure of it. I found evidence of Dwemer construction in the mountains to the west. It looks like the ice has retreated in the ages between when my records were written and today. I'd love to see what else the melting glacier has revealed, but the resulting crevasse has become an attractive shelter for Goblins. After everything I've been through, I will not be stopped by a band of grubby rat-eaters. I'll take the gamble and put everything on this being the site of the Frostvault."

If the number of records left in his estate are any indication, he was as delinquent a borrower there as any bank in Cyrodiil. No one came to collect after I sorted out the matter of inheritance, so they're mine now.\n\n* * *\nThere might be more about the Dwemer found in these dusty boxes than anywhere in the world. I could spend years digging through the volumes, but I'm curious about what else Quintus was up to in the months before the expedition to Volenfell.\n\n* * *\nQuintus really was hopeless without me. There's nothing in his notes on the Eye I don't already know. That was my last lead.\n\n* * *\nPoring over months' worth of Quintus's obtuse observations hasn't been a total loss. Before I forced his hand on retrieving the Eye, he was collecting information on another artifact with even more potential to shake up the historical community: The Mad Rock.\n\n* * *\nIt's Wrathstone. Quintus's translation was lazy."

msgid "My late husband's organizational habits were atrocious, but right now I appreciate his tendency to hoard things. He had several dog-eared volumes and a dozen scrolls relating to the Ayleids mixed in with his research on the Dwemer, even a few originals. I almost dismissed them due to Quintus's slovenly nature, but even he wouldn't have overlooked that much material being out of place. There's still a lot to go through, but it seems like the witless bastard actually found something.\n\n* * *\nI never thought I would be grateful for Quintus's abysmal organizational skills, but here we are. Who knows how long these volumes would have sat gathering dust while I focused my efforts on the Dwemer? He was translating correspondence between Ayleid kingdoms during the Alessian Slave Rebellion with the help of an Ayleid language treatise by the late Tjurhane Fyrre. I intend to decipher the source material myself, but from what I can gather the Ayleids were scrambling to respond to the fall of the White-Gold Tower.\n\n* * *\nMy translation of the Ayleid scrolls confirms that several of the Ayleid kingdoms at war with their rebelling slaves were concocting a plan to turn the tide back in their favor. There are numerous references to an artifact called the Wrathstone, which the Ayleids believed was their answer. They suspected that the Dwemer had it in their possession. They intended to take it from them, by force, and it seems they failed, but I need to confirm that.\n\n* * *\nI take back everything nice I said about Quintus' mess. I'll die of old age before I find what I need in his collections. If there is a method to this madness, it's lost on me, but he never appeared to have difficulty finding what he was looking for in his squalor. Much as I'd like to never see his face again, I'm going to need that treacherous mind of his.\n\n* * *\nI'll have to keep that necromancer in mind if I ever return to Volenfell. I don't usually trust the Undaunted with delicate matters, but she seemed to have a good head on her shoulders. She was more than happy to ""reunite"" me with my late husband, though it took some convincing to get her to let me keep him. The pneumeria chamber I modified is working better than I hoped. Quintus is locked up tight and I can communicate with him as needed. Unfortunately, I can't shut him up as needed.\n\n* * *\nQuintus spent a week venting before he finally realized that his obstinacy was pointless. He's agreed to help me complete his research on the Wrathstone. Enduring his witless barbs is small price to pay.\n\n* * *\nI made the right decision. Quintus was really on to something. He always did have a head for conspiracy. According to the historical record, the Ayleid attacks on the Dwemer were thwarted and they were ultimately crushed by the Alessians. End of story. But if that was the case, why were the Tharns surveying Ayleid ruins not long after the death of Tjurhane Fyrre, and how did House Tharn convince the Potentate to divert resources to building a remote coastal fort during the middle of the biggest civil war in the Empire's history? Aside from the one right now, of course.\n\n* * *\nI don't know how Quintus got his hands on some of these records, but I'd suspect a few favors from the Thieves Guild were involved. The official story of Fort Mistwatch was that it collapsed and was washed away by unseasonable flooding, but that news comes suspiciously after an object was unearthed under the fort. Details are slim, but by the description it could be the Wrathstone. Did they cover up their discovery? I need to see for myself. They may have left something behind that will put me on the trail."

msgid "By Hanu of the Zainab Tribe\n\nHuntsman of the Princes. Father of Manbeasts. The Hungry Cat. Hircine has many names, but all relate to his one known sphere; the hunt. The Daedric Prince is obsessed with the chase, the capture, the kill; whether the prey be mer, man, or beast.\n\nHircine is a favored subject of worship in Tamriel, although it is not out of line to question this popularity. None would go so far as to call him a deity of benevolence. In fact, Hircine has never seemed to actively want worship or reverence. He simply seeks out, tests, and rewards hunters he finds worthy.\n\nPerhaps that's the appeal of such an idol. There's an odd purity to his savagery. Unlike many other Daedric Princes, his boons are generally found to be more or less fair. All his followers must do is prove themselves to him. Do so, and they are promised an afterlife of endless hunts within his Hunting Grounds.\n\nThe Hunting Grounds\n\nFollowers of Hircine are promised one thing; an afterlife within the Prince's realm of Oblivion, known as the Hunting Grounds. An endless forest where endless hunts are held. A land of savagery and violence, where an eternal cycle of death and rebirth take place. \n\nHunting lodges dot the landscape, home to the souls which haunt this realm. Powerful beasts lurk within the forests, allowing Hircine's followers to indulge in spectacular hunts. A true paradise for those who have dedicated their life to the Huntsman Prince.\n\nThe Great Hunt\n\nThough a rare occurrence, Hircine does allow the living to enter his realm. This event is known as the Great Hunt, a deadly competition held for the Huntsman Prince's amusement. This contest of skill and cunning has only one goal in mind; capture the Hare and present it to Hircine. Only then will you earn his favor.\n\nMany die during this bid for Hircine's boon. It's not uncommon for competitors to turn against one another, or to be killed by one of the many natural dangers the realm presents. And the Hare itself, of course, never goes down without a fight.\n\nLycanthropy\n\nHircine's title Father of Manbeasts is a well earned one. He's believed to be the creator of lycanthropy, the ability for mer and man to transform into beastial creatures. The most well known of these lycanthropes are werewolves.\n\nThose infected with lycanthropy, whether by birth or infection, are cursed with an aggressive madness that compels them to bloodlust. Upon their death, they are sent to spend their afterlife within the Hunting Grounds. This is regardless of their allegiance to Hircine.\n\nThere's no known documentation of a soul escaping the Hunting Grounds, but there is one possibility. If a competitor of the Great Hunt would ask for a soul's freedom as their boon, Hircine will be compelled to free that individual's soul. And that is exactly what I must do if I ever wish for my father to be free of that savage realm."

To even find a werewolf transformed by Hircine would be a tremendous task. And then to capture the creature? There's absolutely no guarantee that the Silver Dawn would be capable of such a feat.\n\nEven still, should we not even try? When I think of all of the good that can be accomplished, should my research bear fruit! Is this not our very purpose as an order? To completely eradicate the lycanthrope threat?\n\nI must convince Commander Edette to agree to this research. I must.\n\n***\n\nIt seems the Divines have smiled upon me. Though it's only been a few short months since I've made inquiries, I've just received word of a werewolf named Vykosa hiding somewhere within Malabal Tor.\n\nRumor has it that she is a first turned, changed into a beast by Hircine himself. My records seem to only corroborate this, as I've found records which mention her name that date centuries back. This may be just the opportunity I've been looking for.\n\nUnfortunately, Commander Edette still stands in my way. Her word is law within this keep, and every mention of my research only seems to fill her with a stronger resolve to deny me. \n\nBut I can't give up hope, not now. Not when so much is at stake. I simply must persuade the commander, no matter the cost. And I believe I have just the thing to bring her to my side.\n\n***\n\nCommander Edette has finally agreed to the capture of Vykosa. Unsurprising, given that her own husband has now been cursed with lycanthropy; a transformation courtesy of one of the many blood samples at my disposal.\n\nPut forth the idea of curing masses, and the commander balked at the dangers. But when it's her loved one in need of such a cure? She crumbled right before my eyes. Pathetic.\n\nNow I must simply set a trap for Vykosa. No easy task, of course, but one that I'm confident a man of my intellect can pull off. Victory is almost at hand. One way or another, I will create this cure. By the Eight, I must.

While my earlier testing yielded unacceptably little, my current methods have led to some rather unfortunate setbacks. \n\nNamely, the death of eight members of the pack.\n\nFive of the subjects appeared to have a mental break under the pressure of testing, resulting in an aggressive form of insanity. I had no choice but to put them down, for the safety of myself and fellow researchers. Most unfortunate, given that their strength did seem to greatly increase.\n\nIt was under these circumstances that I lost Subject 42. A shame, as he was one of the few Nords within the pack. I had hoped to perhaps secure his wife for the next round of testing, but Mylenne refused my request. I do hope our dear second-in-command is not letting herself get sentimental.\n\nThree of the subjects simply died, most likely from the sheer physical strain. I had hoped that our vetting process would have eliminated any subjects too weak to undergo testing, but I suppose not everything can be accounted for. I'll have to compile any similarities that were known between these subjects.\n\nAnd then there was the case of Subject 46; a young Khajiit woman who was slotted for testing because of her hesitancy to perform certain tasks. A most interesting case, that one. I still have no leads as to why my testing caused the subject to become immune to Vykosa's power of compulsion.\n\nHowever, there's no mistaking these results, no matter how loath our glorious alpha was to admit it. Luckily, I was able to keep Subject 46 from being executed. After all, the possibility that she may be the key to breaking out of Vykosa's control is a promising prospect.\n\nBut that is testing for another time. Vykosa demands an army of unstoppable werewolf warriors, and so I must obey. For now, at least."

Under any other circumstances, I'd be furious, but driven to discern the root of the failure. \n\nI perfected this Soul Trap over countless iterations, each with its own challenges to overcome. This time, I only feel numb. Sitting alone in this literal pit of despair among the broken bodies of my companions, and the last vestiges of a bygone era. \n\nThe Dragon is gone and its precious soul along with it. The last of its kind, or near enough to make no difference. To the victor goes the spoils? Not this day. I've won nothing but a mountain of decaying meat and scales.\n\n—\n\nI mustn't squander this opportunity. Even without its soul, this corpse contains a wealth of potential. Dissection and preservation will take precedence. There won't be much sleep to be had in the coming days.\n\n—\n\nThe creature's undamaged organs have been transferred to receptacles more suitable for preservation. Foodstuffs and simple reagents can be replaced. My search of the Dragon's den revealed a hoard of Dwemer wealth, much contained in air-tight mechanical lockboxes. \n\nEmptying them out, I discovered a significant quantity of an unknown material: raw chunks of vibrant blue crystal that give off their own light. They'll receive closer examination once I've sealed the remaining perishable Dragon parts in the emptied containers. I take a certain gratification in the irony that these treasure chests will soon mostly contain the Dragon itself.\n\n—\n\nThe crystals are useless. To call them inert is an understatement. They are the essence of stasis. Unchanging and unalterable. I can safely put their study aside indefinitely.\n\n—\n\nMy remaining rations spoiled more quickly than anticipated. I don't know if it was the dank of the ruins, or the prevalence of fungus that lead to this outcome, but I'll be dining on Dragon meat until I find an alternative source of food. \n\nRoast Dragon is an adequate repast, though the meat is dense and thick with ligaments. If I had to describe the taste, I would say it was … fowl.\n\n—\n\nThe claims that Dragon remains retain innate magical properties are not exaggerated, though I would categorize them as more catalytic than anything. Potential applications are broad, though I will refrain from alchemical studies, given the impossibility of acquiring replacement materials.\n\n—\n\nThis creature does not give up its secrets easily. I could spend centuries unravelling them, but that's time I don't have. I have little left to eat and I fear I've lingered too long already. \n\nWithout the strength to descend the mountains, it's time I come to terms with my situation. I will die here, but I intend to do so on my terms. The question is, will those immutable crystals comply?"

I envy the long dormancy of draugr at times like this. \n~~ \nSensing my malaise, one of my ambitious attendants took it upon herself to seek a distraction for her master. She brought me a dry volume of Dwemer history to while away my time. I briefly considered watching her corpse dry into a leathery husk as a more thrilling alternative, but there was a confident smirk in her expression that convinced me to indulge her. \n~~ \nLizabet has served me well. The book she brought me provides a kernel of truth to a fanciful legend. The author claims to have paid a recent visit to the long lost ruin known as Fang Lair. I believe I'd like to see this necropolis. \n~~ \nThe bulk of my followers now scour the Dragon's Teeth Mountains for Fang Lair. Even with clues provided by the historian, it will be quite an undertaking. Even so, this renewed purpose has bolstered my patience. \n~~ \nDuring these months of search, I've collected many records on Dwemer and Dragons. Their ambitions were not dissimilar. Mastery over existence! I'm not so different, though we've all chosen different avenues to explore.

The bones of thousands are strewn throughout the crumbling halls. Some shattered, some blackened, and some fossilized in the stone itself. A record of extinction and terror, but is the centerpiece to this exhibit to be found here among them? \n~~ \nNow here's an unexpected turn. Fang Lair was not entirely uninhabited. We had a very special squatter in our midst: an ancient Lich from a time when the Dragon still lived and breathed, and one of the group responsible for ensuring it ceased to do so. He has so much to tell me, once I've made him more compliant.\n~~\nThe Lich conducted obsessive studies of the Dragon's remains during his stay here, so very kind of him to share. Adapting them to my methods will not be difficult. I'm already envisioning a wondrous display, though my conversation with the Lich and his companions has revealed a missing element. This Dragon possessed a priesthood during its lifetime and the High Priestess is nowhere to be found. I must have her."

msgid "Arkngthamz-Phng: \nCaught in the Dragon's Teeth\n\nBy Neramo\n\nPerhaps one of the most storied, yet least understood legacies of the Dwemer is the lost city of Arkngthamz-Phng. The element most engrained into its mythos, the almost singular thing it's known for, is its demise. Very little is remembered about what it was or how it came to be. Even its name has been obscured by the colorful moniker ""Fang Lair,"" a truncated adulteration of the original ""Phng"" paired with a suitably sinister descriptor for the home of its most infamous resident. You've undoubtedly heard some derivation of a legend retold over thousands of years, so it should suffice to say that the story of a Dragon taking roost in this formerly Dwarven city has sadly overshadowed the fascinating history that came before.  \n\nThankfully, through my research, some aspects of this buried history can now be brought to light. My findings suggest that in the decades following the establishment of peace between the Chimer and Dwemer, Dwarves of Clan Kragen began to seek new holdings beyond Resdayn. Following the path laid out by the exiled Clan Rourken during their exodus, the Dwarves of Kragen reached what we now consider Skyrim and first established their presence in the region with the founding of Arkngthamz.\n\nIt's unclear precisely what appealed so much to the Kragen explorers that it was worth settling among the hostile Nords, but in spite of regular attacks by the warlike Men, their city flourished. So much so that it encouraged other clans to expand their own holdings to the west. This loose alliance of clans effectively established a pocket empire of four city-states that were considered unassailable. Not that the Nords stopped trying.\n\nPerhaps it was this success, or the presence of so many nearby clans, that drove Clan Kragen to press on with their expansion west through the treacherous Dragon's Teeth Mountains, but I believe they sought to bridge their new empire with the their estranged cousins in Volenfell. Whatever the case, they broke stone for a sister city on the border of modern Hammerfell: Arkngthamz-Phng.\n\nDespite the inhospitable terrain, there is some evidence to suggest that the Dwarves aggressively carved out this burgeoning settlement, which soon supplanted its predecessor as the seat of Clan Kragen's power. Though greatly devastated, the expansive vaults of Arkngthamz-Phng's main hall are still majestic in their scale. It's easy to see how such a vast, secluded space, rich with resources and life, would be an attractive home for a Dragon seeking more well-appointed accommodations than those chiseled out by Nords in the service of the Dragon Priesthood. \n\nSadly, my first expedition met unexpected resistance, forcing me to abandon the site before more significant revelations could be unearthed; however, I have no doubts that the interest garnered by this publication will see a second, more ambitious expedition come to fruition."

msgid "By Jorvuld Davaux, Dragon Priest Historian\n\nZaan the Scalecaller was a Dragon Priest of short life and little renown. She commanded no great battles, conquered no powerful enemies. At just a glance, one would think her unremarkable, unworthy of further inspection. Certainly that has been the viewpoint of historians up to this point, given the lack of academia written on her. However, the fact that Zaan's story has been so ignored is exactly what makes her such a fascinating subject.\n\nZaan was uncommonly young when chosen by her Dragon Lord, the mighty Dovah Thurvokun. It is said that her connection to Thurvokun was particularly strong. As we know, there is much speculation on the connection between a Dragon and their chosen priest, whether it be spiritual, magical, or perhaps merely political. Whatever the case, Zaan grew a rapid and robust attachment, which her followers took as a sign of great fortune. For a decade or so, all was well.\n\nThe turmoil began when Thurvokun left his temple, for reasons unknown to all but perhaps Zaan herself. By all accounts, it was this departure that led to the Dragon Priest's steady decline into a depressive state, though it is uncertain whether this was magically or psychologically induced. This depression brought about frequent seclusion, growing into a steady isolation.\n\nHer followers slowly grew discontent, and as time went by many became mistrustful. They believed that Thurvokun had abandoned them, and saw this with the despair that we today would see the loss of the Divines. They began to accuse Scalecaller of driving him away with her weakness. When confronted with these accusations, it is said that Scalecaller made no protest. Her followers took this as admittance, and killed her in their anger. \n\nThis leads us to Zaan's greatest mystery. When accused by her followers, why did she not defend herself?\n\nMy theory, though mostly speculative, is that the Dragon Priest simply was not able. The loss of her Dragon Lord had brought upon such misery that she had lost her will, or perhaps even her ability, to speak. Again, whether this was brought upon by magical means or mere psychological trauma, I am still unsure. \n\nI believe through studying this historical occurrence we may gain further insight into the link between Dragon Priests and their Dragon Lords. We must look past the rudimentary political aspects of such a relationship, to see what lies beyond. What precisely was this spiritual connection, so highly revered? With Scalecaller's help, we can begin to answer that question."

Not beyond, not as I do.\n\nMy research with the ogres in the caverns has produced … admittedly mixed results. They were easy enough to infect. Predictable patterns and slow wits make for lovely test subjects. We saw early signs of the physical manifestations of the disease, yes, oh yes. Lovely, absolutely lovely. These disgusting creatures became beautiful under my guidance. Oh, how lucky they were, to be the first embraced by such a loving illness.\n\nBut then it turned all wrong! They turned out all wrong, all wrong! The way they've begun to act, you wouldn't even think they were sick. Nasty, stupid creatures won't even die! They just became … angry. Stronger. Downright mean! They started attacking my researchers. I'm afraid we lost quite a few just last night. Hopefully we can still remain on schedule, but I can see quite a delay already.\n\nThough it pains me to leave such research behind, I simply must conclude that these ogres are too beast like. We'll need more human subjects if we wish to continue our research. We simply have no time for our usual procedures, given how isolated this mountain is. Many have proposed the giants may prove to be useful. Dangerous, dangerous, but what is discovery without a few deaths?\n\nOn a personal note, my other ear has finally rotted off. There's still a bit more to go, but the current state shows promise. Everyday I become more beautiful, more perfect. More blessed."

msgid "Now here's a turn of good fortune! We've found the perfect site for a stronghold if ever there was one. I know I said that the last time, but this isn't some crumbling old fort with breezy barracks and moldering sheets. No, these ruins we found are a highwayman's paradise.\n\nWe're well off the beaten path here. Through some caverns and a valley not visible from the mountain pass. No chance of Nord soldiers patrolling by and noticing a poorly concealed campfire, again. In fact, we don't even need campfires for more than cooking anymore, and maybe not even that. There are lava channels all through the area that keep the caverns and ruins nice and toasty. That probably explains why it's so lush too. You'd never expect to find so much growth this high in the mountains, much less vines nearly as thick as I am wide.\n\nThe way I see it, if things are looking lean or we need to lay low, we could probably live pretty well off the land here. Chop up some vines, melt some snow, and settle in on a bed of warm grass until things blow over. Practically the lap of luxury by hideout standards.\n—\nAll right, so maybe hauling the goods back to this place is a bit more effort than I anticipated, but I haven't so much as seen the speck of another Man or Mer in the distance on the way back. There're rumors that the Reachmen use the trails out this way, but what have we got to fear from a bunch of stone-bangers in loincloths? Still, might do to set up some snares and alarms until we've got these ruins fortified.\n—\nI don't think I noticed how much the walls look like they're bleeding when we first found this place. There's this dusty red stone all over. I mean, it's not like they're actually bleeding … I just can't get the image out of my head now that I've seen it. \n—\nNearly killed one of the gang last night while we were sleeping. I was feeling restless is all, and he wouldn't stop fidgeting. The creak of his leathers was tickling my ears like a squeaky cart wheel every time I thought I might drift off. I made to smack him, but when I turned to look he was sleeping like the dead, still as can be, but the creaking was still in my ears.\n\nIt was the vines. Writhing like drunk serpents.\n—\nI had to get away for a bit. The shifting of those vines can cut right through a crowd to reach my ears now. I'm just going a bit stir crazy is all. Figure I'll poke around the pass and get a better lay of the land.\n—\nThird flock of crows to pass in less than an hour. Or maybe the same lot and just lost? Seems a bit late in the season for birds to be lingering about. Bad omen, or so I hear anyway.\n—\nI don't know where they came from. Reachmen scouring the mountains. Scores of them! It looks like they're hunting for something, but it's not like there's anything out here for the likes of them … except us. They don't seem to have found the hideaway yet, but I've got a sinking feeling that won't be the case for long.\n—\nI'd like nothing better that to tell the gang to pack it in and high tail it out of here, but I don't see us slipping past all those barbarians unnoticed. Guess we'll be waiting things out sooner than anticipated.\n—\nDamn birds! The crows have taken roost in our ruins and it's been non-stop cawing ever since. The way it carried through the caverns you'd think they were ten times their size.\n\nGods, make it stop!"

My present theory is that this place was a forge of some kind. It harnessed the power of these lava flows to smelt the tribe's ore and heat their metals. There appears to be a large basin where such items were cooled, but I've found no evidence of a convenient water source.\n\nThere are also massive stone hammers and anvils that must have been used by their smiths, but the mechanism by which they operate is not known to me and I detect no magical properties.

msgid "Fate is a strange thing. The path of one's fortune turns often and unpredictably, without any rhyme or reason to mortal minds, though the series of events that led me to this place speak to an intelligence arranging the scenes. Like so many great discoveries, this one was made by accident, leading me to believe Julianos has a mischievous streak.\n\nHampered by delays, my expedition to Craglorn did not even begin until Frost Fall. A wiser person would have put off the trek for the next year, but I'd been held up long enough and let spite rule me. Fiery determination kept me warm through the first few nights ascending the Jerall Mountains, but like any savvy highwayman, the cold chose to rob me of that determination once I'd come too far to turn and flee.\n\nWith little choice other than brave the nearest dry cave and pray that it was home to neither bear nor troll, I discovered a natural cavern extending some distance into the rock. I nearly leapt out of my skin as a chilling howl rolled through the stony interior, but it was only a stiff wind that tugged at my clothes in the darkness. Curious, I temporarily abandoned my search for the most comfortable patch of granite to bed down upon to search for the source.\n\nWhat I discovered was a secluded valley surrounded on all sides by the mountain, and that might have been the end of it, had the bear I'd blundered past not roused from its stupor. Weary as I was, the anger of the sluggish beast was more than enough incentive for me to brave the cold a little longer. Unlike the hinterlands along the mountain path, the wilderness I found myself in was still clinging to life in spite of the bitter cold. \n\nThe land might have been weathering the chill with grace, but I was still likely to die of exposure without some form of shelter, so I soldiered on in search of a quiet nook to stuff my bedroll into. I thought I might collapse on more than one occasion, which would have certainly spelled death for me in this frigid clime, but my perseverance was rewarded soon enough. At the far end of the valley stood an ancient ruin, carved right from the mountain. Without the energy to marvel or the sense to concern myself with what dangers might lie within, I heaved the massive stone doors open with the last of my strength and collapsed into a heap. My last thoughts lingered on the gust of warm air that greeted me as I slipped out of consciousness. \n\nI woke to find myself face down, not on frigid stone, but warm earth and lush grass. At first I took the dampness of my clothes for thawed frost, but it was my sweat that had the cloth clinging to my skin. The ruins, it seemed, were constructed throughout a cavern filled with active lava flows coursing through it. I attempted to justify the presence of such vibrant plant life to myself as a symptom of the tropical warmth, but that excuse didn't hold up to scrutiny. Something about this place was causing the unusual growth and these ruins were either the cause, or likely built here because of the caverns unique properties.\n\nNo longer at risk of dying from exposure, I settled in at the mouth of the cavern and studied the exterior of the ruin in great detail. They were Nedic in origin, that much was obvious to me, but less refined than other architecture I'd seen around Cyrodiil. Pre-Alessian, even. I could have spent months in Craglorn hunting for a find as significant as this, and I stumbled upon it—quite literally—barely a few days after embarking. Fate is a strange thing indeed."

How dare we show weakness as they steal our contracts and kill our agents. My words stoke the fire as my knives provide the fuel and they are none the wiser. Indolent, arrogant, fools.\n—\nThe Lady of Lace was pleased with my deception. The Morag Tong is chasing shadows, while the real threat mounts far from their notice. For my efforts, I have been invited to join the Silken Ring. Through them I will no longer merely pay lip service to Mephala, but do her bidding by my own hands. How can the promise of gold compare to reaping the blessings of the Daedra?\n—\nThe Lady has asked one last thing of me before I may receive the blessings of the Spinner. An offering of devotion. A sacrifice befitting Mephala. Some other fool might be tempted to rush out and work their knife in her name. Not I. This requires care. My introduction must be perfect.\n—\nI have never desired ties. Why chain my heart to the weapons my enemies would wield against me? There have been moments though, where I have been handed those shackles and invited to clasp the lock closed. Nyri, was one such temptation. Perhaps it is now my turn to offer the bonds.\n—\nNyri was unprepared for my advances, for good reason. I'd made my intentions clear before. I did not give her time to question my change of heart, as hers still harbored affection for me. Nyli's reason melted at my touch, and she has fallen into Mephala's web willingly.\n—\nI have whispered lies into Nyli's ear for many nights now. Seeded doubt in her mind about the Morag Tong. Convinced her that we should act without their sanction. I will lead her to the Silken Ring tonight. It will be perfect.\n—\nThe look on Nyri's face as the dagger pierced her heart was exquisite. It was as if all the emotions she'd secreted away inside burst forth in one last agonizing torrent, before she died. The Lady of Lace was so moved by my sacrifice that I've caught her eye. As it should be.\n—\nI go now, into the Cradle of Shadows, to taste Mephala's true power. The reward for my devotion will be sublime.\n—\nThis was that right move. I'm more sure of it than ever. Any doubts I had disappeared when I met the Lady of Lace. The power she offers is more than anything the fools back in Morrowind can imagine. One of many benefits gained from casting off the shackles of mortal whims to embrace a higher purpose. This is what the Morag Tong must have been before it became strangled by bureaucracy and beholden to false gods."

The creatia is a thing of chaos. The call to Sithis is in its nature. But we must remain deaf to his commands.  Those Saxhleel who call him father languish in mud huts and eat old fish from wooden bowls.
