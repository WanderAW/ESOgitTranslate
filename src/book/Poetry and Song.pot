msgid "The Book of Dawn and Dusk is a collections of sayings and aphorisms attributed variously to the Tribunals and to their saints and servants. Many of these sayings have become common cliches of everyday life in Morrowind. The following selection of slogans will illustrate many of the simplest notions of the Tribunal faithful.\n\nSpeak none but good of the Gods.\n\nWe can have no opinions about Truth.\n\nRumors flow from the House of Troubles.\n\nCount only the happy hours.\n\nNo child has a sinner's heart.\n\nLet faith be your only law.\n\nFear of the fool is the beginning of wisdom.\n\nAlmsivi in every hour.\n\nWalk always in the presence of your Lords.\n\nComfort is given, justice is taken.\n\nLearn by serving.\n\nFrom the heart, the light; from the head, the law.\n\nBlessed Almsivi, Mercy, Mastery, Mystery.\n\nForge a keen Faith in the crucible of suffering.\n\nEngrave upon thy eye the image of injustice.\n\nDeath does not diminish; the ghost gilds with glory.\n\nFaith conquers all. Let us yield to Faith.\n\nBetter to suffer a wrong than to do one.\n\nThe heavens are in their glory, applaud!\n\nFolly secures its power to harm.\n\nThough forbidden to some, not to you.\n\nOh, how rarely wisdom rules our hearts!\n\nBlessed are we who serve Almsivi.\n\nThree mouths sing Mercy, Mastery, Mystery.\n\nGather no seed in the fields of Oblivion.\n\nThe Thrice-Sealed House withstands the Storm.\n\nBy Breath and Blood protect us all!\n\nCan ghosts or justice change with time?\n\nConsider your end, mortal!\n\nAccept grace without limits.\n\nEnter the rhapsody of the God-Poet.\n\nKneel before the Teacher's chair.\n\nThree Hands, three Hearts, three Eyes.\n\nKeep no secret from your Judge's scale.\n\nForge Darkness into Light.\n\nRefuse neither brother nor ghost.\n\nBlessed Almsivi, through birth, life, ghost.\n\nFrom glowing ashes the Poet's wrath shall shine.\n\nIf Vivec is for us, who can stand against us?\n\nFate, monstrous and empty, the whirling wheel of evil.\n\nHow black my heart, roasting fiercely?"

msgid "The Cantatas of Vivec are gospels written in the form of epic songs. They trace the evolution of Vivec from a foolish mortal into an enlightened divine. Vivec sought out experiences that tested him in every way possible, particularly in the defense and protection of his Dunmer people, and through his long life, his humility, and his unconquerable spirit, he attained the Wisdom of the Seven Graces. The Cantatas relate many stories of Vivec's experiments with challenge and risk, his failures and triumphs, his blessings of insight and good fortune, and his debt to his partners, Almalexia the Lover and Sotha Sil the Teacher. The poetry is simple and dramatic, lyric and personal, composed to be sung or recited. The following is an excerpt from Lord Vivec's ""Brooding Beneath Red Mountain.""\n\nThe gaunt ghostfires loom as subtle shrouds,\n\nSmokes and shades on the biers of Red Mountain.\n\nArches and spires line the rock halls,\n\nDimly lit by the spirits of the dead.\n\nThe blood of broken hearths and houses\n\nRuns in red rivers, blossoms in fountains.\n\nGirdled round within walls of wit's glass\n\nThe shattered hosts slumber in cradles of ash.\n\nBut when shall they wake?\n\nWhat dark crucible may kindle their souls to light?\n\nHow long beneath red-reeking clouds\n\nMust flickering watchfires burn?\n\nHow many lifetimes of labor and lament\n\nWill it take to seal this restless tomb?"
