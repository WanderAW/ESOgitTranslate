msgid "On the Utility of Marbles and Needles\n\nBy Marobar Sul\n\nA Nord, a Chimer, and a Dwemer walked into a cornerclub. \n\n""What'll it be, muthseras?"" the barkeep asked. \n\n""Give me a mug of mead,"" said the Nord. \n\n""I'll have a snifter of shein—the good stuff, mind you,"" said the Chimer. \n\n""Kindly serve me an infusion of chal, a marble, and a leather-sewing needle,"" said the Dwemer. \n\n""Haw, haw,"" guffawed the Nord. ""Shor's bones! The little milk-drinker's going to play pick-up-sticks, but he can handle only one stick!""\n\n""At least I don't swear by a god who is not only imaginary, but dead,"" said the Dwemer, as the barkeep placed his items on the counter. \n\n""Hey! What?"" the Nord blustered. ""Why, I ought to…!""\n\n""He's got you there, by Azura's Star,"" said the Chimer, sipping at his shein. ""A point for you, Dwarf.""\n\n""On the other hand, at least the Nord doesn't think it's clever to worship demons from other planes,"" said the Dwemer, swirling his chal. \n\n""Boethiah and Mephala! You go too far!"" cried the Chimer, drawing a triangular dagger. \n\n""Yeah! Let's gut the runt!"" growled the Nord, pulling a hand-axe. \n\nThe Dwemer knocked the marble off the counter. It landed on the floor just where the Chimer was putting down his foot for his thrust. He slipped, lurched left, and buried his dagger to the hilt in the surprised Nord's chest. Meanwhile the Dwemer gave the big needle a precise flick of the finger; it spun down and lodged in a crack between the floor-planks, point up. As the Chimer back-pedaled from the dying Nord, he lost his balance and fell headfirst to the floor, where the needle pierced one of his golden eyes all the way into his brain. It took several minutes of flailing, but eventually the Chimer was as dead as the Nord. \n\nThe Dwemer pulled a coin-purse from the Chimer's belt and gave it to the barkeep, swallowed the Nord's mead in one prolonged chug, picked up the snifter of shein and took a sip, then nodded to the barkeep and left the cornerclub, snifter in hand. ""Off to the market,"" they heard him say. ""I must get a bone-tweezer, a guar egg, and a boot-jack."""

msgid "In the Deep Halls, Far from Men\n\nForsaken Red Mountain, Twisted Kin\n\nHail the Mind, Hail the Stone\n\nDwarven Pride, Stronger than Bone\n\nMy studies, and this text, have focused heavily on the fact that Dwemer archaeological sites west of Vvardenfell seem to be built at much greater depths than their counterparts near the Red Mountain. I believe there was a specific threshold to which Dwarven excavators would dig before the construction of vital structures began.\n\nI have referred to this threshold as the ""geocline,"" but I have found that to be redundant with the Deep Venue of a colony. Still, there is some variation in the actual depth of a Deep Venue, whereas the geocline is always the marker where I reason the city proper begins.\n\nTunnels and chambers at more shallow depths, while often grand in their architectural style, appear to have served little in the way of critical civic purpose. Above the geocline, surplus stores of food, warehouse chambers that may have been used in trading with nearby surface settlements, and barracks for topside patrols are common.\n\nThese tunnels, I have observed, can meander in a seemingly more random pattern than those planned structures beneath. I hypothesize that this may be due to the unpredictable nature of any excavation, even to a race as clever as the Dwemer. Surely unexpected deposits of stone or geological events could make the effort difficult. I think that these haphazard tunnels are often the result of the search for suitable substratum to build within.\n\nI have found in a small number of ruins referencing a geological anomaly or place known as ""Fal'Zhardum Din."" This is intriguing because the term not only appears in a few tablet fragments, but also very specifically on ornate metal frames in the deepest reaches of the Alftand, Irkgnthand, and Mzinchaleft strongholds of Skyrim. I have yet to decipher the meaning of these elaborate carvings, but consider it highly strange that they occur in the deepest part of each of these ruin.\n\nThe most reasonable translation of ""Fal'Zhardum Din"" I have managed to decipher is ""Blackest Kingdom Reaches,"" but I cannot imagine what that means.\n\nI suspect there may be some pattern I am failing to notice. This creeping doubt has haunted my career in recent years, and I have begun to doubt if I will unravel some grand secret of the Dwarves in my lifetime, though it lies just under my nose … or under my feet."

msgid "Their Architecture and Civilization\n\nBy Thelwe Ghelein, Scholar\n\n\nIn the Deep Halls, Far from Men\n\nForsaken Red Mountain, Twisted Kin\n\nHail the Mind, Hail the Stone\n\nDwarven Pride, Stronger than Bone\n\n\nThe limited written record supports the perception of the Deep Elves as culturally revering the pursuits of logic and science. This stands in stark contrast to the belief system of most other Mer cultures. When we imagine a society structured around such a central ideology, it seems reasonable that prolific scholars, especially in fields such as mathematics, metallurgy, or architecture, would be elevated to social status like that of clergy in a more mystically inclined culture. The idea is supported by a fragment of Dwemeris text recovered from a colony in Skyrim—Irkgnthand—which I believe to be associated with Clan Rourken. My translation is as follows:\n\n""Risen by order cousin-of-privilege Cuolec of Scheziline privileged duties. Clanhome building Hoagen Kultorra tradition to Hailed World shaper""\n\n""To raise granted-cousin Cuolec of <untranslatable> privilege with duties for family-home building Hoagen Kultorra<?> tradition to father Mundus shaper""\n\nSome scholars interpret this as evidence of Dwemer worship of Mundus, but I do not agree. My translation of this passage suggests that a respected Dwemer by the name of Cuolec was promoted to a civic position, probably as a tonal architect. The latter half of the fragment suggests that Cuolec's position requires him to build in a specific style.\n\nThe term Hoagen Kultorra has thus far eluded me, but I believe it may be the name of such a style. It's possible there were several styles, differing in their construction principles and typical structures.\n\nOne earmark of what I believe was the prevalent Dwemer style among Northern clans was a feature I call the Deep Venue. Deep Venues are often made up of one or more expansive natural caverns in which several other structures occur. Structures within the Venue may be carved from the stone itself or freely erected upon the cavern floor. The largest and most impressive Venues, such as those found in Bthardamz, may even feature roads wide enough for ten large men to walk shoulder-meets-shoulder along it.\n\nArcanex are typically smaller structures. Very few have been properly studied before disruption by graverobbers or greedy adventurers, but those few undisturbed sites have contained a surprising collection of magical objects, such as soul gems, alchemical concoctions, and magical texts. Some scholars take these as evidence that the Dwemer did, in fact, dabble in the magical arts. Based on what we know of their culture, as well as the fact that most arcanex are minor structures compared to other common fixtures, I would suggest that these were centers of study and nothing more. Perhaps the Dwarves established these halls as a means to study Men and Mer, who surely seemed as alien to them as the Dwemer seem to us today.\n\nGreat Animoculotories can be found in many Dwarven strongholds. These were the factories where the centurions and various other constructs were built. I have hoped to study these chambers for clues as to the means by which those mysterious automata are given life, but those same guardians make them especially difficult and dangerous areas to explore."

msgid "Their Architecture and Civilization\n\nBy Thelwe Ghelein, Scholar\n\n\nIn the Deep Halls, Far from Men\n\nForsaken Red Mountain, Twisted Kin\n\nHail the Mind, Hail the Stone\n\nDwarven Pride, Stronger than Bone\n\n\nMy life's work has been dedicated to investigating the Dwemer, their dubious history, and their mysterious banishment. My goal with this text is sharing my findings and conclusions based on eighty years spent studying their unique architectural remains.\n\nThe Migration of the Deep Elves from their ancestral Dwemereth, now Morrowind, is a generally accepted fact. Recorded history supports this, specifically mentioning the Rourken Clan's refusal to join King Dumac in the forming of the First Council and their subsequent exodus to Hammerfell. The architectural premise is also sound, as the building habits of the Dwarves adapted and changed, albeit slowly and in subtle ways, over time and land. I propose that some of these differences are stylistic as well as practical.\n\nTraditional viewpoints suggest that the Vvardenfell Dwemer were the most prolific of their kind. Based on my excavations throughout Skyrim, Morrowind, and High Rock, I am not sure that this is the case. While Vvardenfell is almost cluttered with Dwarven ruins poking through the surface of the landscape, the construction of those ruins is fundamentally different from the majority of what I've observed elsewhere.\n\nFurthermore, as we delve into Vvardenfell ruins, we notice that their internal structure is quite different. While major civic and operational chambers are found near the surface in a Vvardenfell Ruin, that is not typically the case on the mainland. Minor passageways and storehouse rooms are near the surface, but more important locations do not occur until we explore much deeper.\n\nBecause such major locations are well-hidden in Dwemer Ruins outside of Morrowind, many scholars believed they were in fact not present in ruins outside that province. This premature conclusion has led some to believe such sites to be mere outposts. My research has shown this not to be the case.\n\nA few theories may explain this difference. Perhaps clan architects simply had their own styles and preferences when it came to civic planning. This seems only somewhat likely, as Dwarven techniques were based on empirical study, and there was likely little room for creative interpretation when it came to building technique. Geological makeup of the terrain almost certainly played a role, especially in a region like Northern Skyrim, where the ground near the surface is very rocky and often frozen, as opposed to the volcanic substratum common in Vvardenfell or the ubiquitous aquifers found in Hammerfell. It's possible that Dwarven architects in the North were not able to excavate larger structures until reaching more pliable strata.\n\nThis scholar would like to suggest, however, that many structures west of Morrowind were built after 1E 420. When the Clan Rourken left Vvardenfell, it seems evident that several clans broke off to create their own settlements, choosing to live in greater isolation than their Eastern brethren. This theory is particularly fascinating, because it leads me to believe that Dwarven architects may have developed even more elaborate methods of hiding their strongholds over time.\n\nThis opens the distinct possibility that undisturbed Dwarven archaeological sites exist throughout Tamriel, even in southern areas like Cyrodiil or Black Marsh, where Dwarves are not believed to have ever had a significant presence. Though we should not get carried away on flights of fancy, one could extrapolate this logic to suggest that some Dwarven clans were living among us for much longer than previously believed, perhaps well beyond the disappearance during the War of the Red Mountain in 1E 700."

msgid "The Snow Elf and the Variation-Lens\n\nBy Marobar Sul\n\nMzulchond the Tonal Architect had spent twenty years attuning the great animus geode he'd found in Inner Duathand, trying to synchronize it with the precession of the dual equinoxes in order to captivate the Nirnpith Essence. The geode's vibratory affinities continued to elude him, however, so one day he threw down his attenuators, left his workshop, and went to the kitchens for an infusion of chal. \n\nAs he approached the kitchen portal he heard sibilant music that cut off abruptly as he stepped over the threshold. His house-assistant, a Snow Elf maiden named Lilyarel, withdrew her hands from behind the steam-grill and looked up guiltily. \n\n""I heard music, Lilyarel,"" Mzulchond said. ""What did you just put behind the calorefactor?""\n\n""It's nothing, Sir Dwarf,"" the maiden replied. ""Just something I cobbled together to pass the time.""\n\n""What? Have you been in my device-closet again? Show me what you have there.""\n\nReluctantly, the Snow Elf reached behind the steam-grill and drew out a fist-sized object of golden metal, crystal knobs glinting on its flange-hood. Mzulchond held out his hand, open, and Lilyarel carefully placed the object in it. ""Don't drop it,"" she said. ""It'll get de-tuned.""\n\n""Well, well,"" the engineer said. ""So you've built yourself a crude tonal variation-lens. Is this what was playing the music I heard?""\n\n""Yes, Sir Dwarf,"" the maiden said, gazing at the floor. ""I hope I didn't do anything wrong.""\n\n""What, with this device? There's nothing dangerous in a melodic repeater bauble, so long as it doesn't leak bthun-waves from its volumizer. Can't have that—might interfere with the static condensers.""\n\n""Oh, don't worry, I used arkoid shielding—not very much!"" she said anxiously. ""But it's not a melodic repeater, Sir, it harmonizes with my mental melodies."" \n\n""Nonsense,"" Mzulchond scoffed. ""No one knows how to synchronize a variation-lens with mental concept-cycles. It's never been done.""\n\n""I wouldn't know anything about that, Sir Dwarf,"" Lilyarel said, wringing her hands nervously. ""I just flipped the duum-emitter so it canceled the demi-ektar-waves, and it worked just fine. Can I have it back now?""\n\n""Hold on a dzum,"" the engineer said, raising a hand while he looked more closely at the gleaming device. ""Flipping the duum-emitter cancels the demi-ektars? Yes … yes, I can see how that might work. This may be just the thing I need to attune my animus geode to the Nirnpith Essence!""\n\nAs Mzulchond turned in excitement to take the variation-lens back to his workshop, the Elf maiden picked up a flipper-strut with both hands and struck him across the back of the head. The tonal architect fell dead to the ground, as Lilyarel picked up her shiny device. ""Never liked him,"" she hissed to herself. ""Always smelled like Dwemer oil.""\n\nThen she opened the brazen louvers of a vent-tube, crawled in, and began lowering herself down through the inwards of the Dwarven city. ""Guess I'm going down to join the Undermer, and not coming back."" And with that, she turned on her variation-lens, which immediately began harmonizing with her mental melodies."

msgid "The Ransom of Zarek, Part 2\n\n""Now thou wert just showing off,"" frowned Jalemmil. ""Surely that would have been a good time to escape.""\n\n""Thou might think so,"" agreed Zarek. ""But thou had to see the topography—a few large trees, and then nothing but shrubs. Ulin would have noticed my absence and caught up with me in no time, and I would have had a hard time explaining Mathais's absence. However, the brief forage around the area allowed me to observe some of the trees close up, and I could formulate my final plan.\n\n""When I got back to camp with a few twigs, I told Ulin that Mathais was slow coming along, dragging a large dead tree behind him. Ulin scoffed at his brother's strength, saying it would take him time to pull up a live tree by the roots and drop it on the bonfire. I expressed reasonable doubt.\n\n""'I'll show thee,' he said, ripping up a ten-foot-tall specimen effortlessly.\n\n""'But that's scarcely a sapling,' I objected. 'I thought thou couldst rip up a tree.' His eyes followed mine to a magnificent, heavy-looking one at the edge of the clearing. Ulin grabbed it and began to shake it with a tremendous force to loosen its roots from the dirt. With that, he loosened the hive from the uppermost branches, dropping it down onto his head.\n\n""That was when I made my escape, mother,"" said Zarek in conclusion, showing a little schoolboy pride. ""While Mathais and Koorg were at the base of the cliff, and Ulin was flailing about, engulfed by a swarm.""\n\nJalemmil embraced her son once again.\n\nPublisher's Note:\n\nI was reluctant to publish Marobar Sul's ""Ancient Scrolls of the Dwemer,"" but when the University of Gwylim Press asked me to edit this edition, I decided to use this as an opportunity to set the record straight once and for all.\n\nScholars do not agree on the exact date of Marobar Sul's work, but it is generally agreed that they were written by the playwright ""Gor Felim,"" famous for popular comedies and romances during the Second Era after the fall of the Reman Empire. The current theory holds that Felim heard a few genuine Dwemer tales and adapted them to the stage in order to make money, along with rewritten versions of many of his own plays.\n\nGor Felim created the persona of ""Marobar Sul"" who could translate the Dwemer language in order to add some sort of validity to the work and make it even more valuable to the gullible. Note that while ""Marobar Sul"" and his works became the subject of heated controversy, there are no reliable records of anyone actually meeting ""Marobar Sul,"" nor was there anyone of that name employed by the Mages Guild, the School of Julianos, or any other intellectual institution.\n\nIn any case, the Dwemer in most of the tales of ""Marobar Sul"" bear little resemblance to the fearsome, unfathomable race that frightened even the Dunmer, Nords, and Redguards into submission and built ruins that even now have yet to be understood."

msgid "(This book is a historical account of the development of Dwemer law and custom from its roots in High Elven culture.)\n\nIn short, so far as I am able to trace the order of development in the customs of the Bosmeri tribes, I believe it to have been in all ways comparable to the growth of Altmeri law. The earlier liability for slaves and animals was mainly confined to surrender. As in the Sumerset Isles, this later became compensation.\n\nWhat does this matter for a study of our laws today? So far as concerns the influence of the Altmeri law upon our own, especially the Altmeri law of master and servant, the evidence of this is to be found in every judgment which has been recorded for the last five hundred years. It has been stated already that we still repeat the reasoning of the Altmeri magistrates, empty as it is, to the present day. I will quickly show how Altmeri custom can be followed into the courts of the Dwemer.\n\nIn the laws of Karndar Watch (P.D. 1180) it is said, ""If one who is owned by another slays one who owns himself, the first owner must pay the associates of the slain three fine instruments and the body of the one who his owned."" There are many other similar citations. The same principle is extended even to the case of a centurion by which a man is killed. ""If at the common workbench, one is slain by an Animunculi, the associates of the slain may disassemble the Animunculi and take its parts within thirty days.""\n\nConsider what Dhark has mentioned concerning the rude beasts of the Tenmar forests. ""If a marsh cat was killed by an Argonian, his family were in disgrace till they retaliated by killing the Argonian or another like it. Furthermore, if a marsh cat was killed by a fall from a tree, his relatives would take their revenge by toppling the tree, shattering its branches, and casting them to every part of the forest."""

msgid "Azura and the Box\n\nBy Marobar Sul\n\nNchylbar had enjoyed an adventurous youth, but had grown to be a very wise, very old Dwemer who spent his life searching for truth and dispelling superstitions. He invented much and created many theorems and logic structures that bore his name. But much of the world still puzzled him, and nothing was a greater enigma to him than the nature of the Aedra and Daedra. Over the course of his research, he came to the conclusion that many of the gods were entirely fabricated by man and mer.\n\nNothing, however, was a greater question to Nchylbar than the limits of divine power. Were the Greater Beings the masters of the entire world, or did the humbler creatures have the strength to forge their own destinies? As Nchylbar found himself nearing the end of his life, he felt he must understand this last basic truth.\n\nAmong the sage's acquaintances was a holy Chimer priest named Athynic. When the priest was visiting Bthalag-Zturamz, Nchylbar told him what he intended to do to find the nature of divine power. Athynic was terrified, and pleaded with his friend not to break this great mystery, but Nchylbar was resolute. Finally, the priest agreed to assist out of love for his friend, though he feared the results of this blasphemy.\n\nAthynic summoned Azura. After the usual rituals by which the priest declared his faith in her powers and Azura agreed to do no harm to him, Nchylbar and a dozen of his students entered the summoning chamber, carrying with them a large box.\n\n""As we see you in our land, Azura, you are the Goddess of the Dusk and Dawn and all the mysteries therein,"" said Nchylbar, trying to appear as kindly and obsequious as he could be. ""It is said that your knowledge is absolute.""\n\n""So it is,"" smiled the Daedra.\n\n""You would know, for example, what is in this wooden box,"" said Nchylbar.\n\nAzura turned to Athynic, her brow furrowed. The priest was quick to explain, ""Goddess, this Dwemer is a very wise and respected man. Believe me, please, the intention is not to mock your greatness, but to demonstrate it to this scientist and to the rest of his skeptical race. I have tried to explain your power to him, but his philosophy is such that he must see it demonstrated.""\n\n""If I am to demonstrate my might in a way to bring the Dwemer race to understanding, it might have been a more impressive feat you would have me do,"" growled Azura, who turned to look Nchylbar in the eyes. ""There is a red-petaled flower in the box.""\n\nNchylbar did not smile or frown. He simply opened the box and revealed to all that it was empty.\n\nWhen the students turned to look to Azura, she was gone. Only Athynic had seen the Goddess' expression before she vanished, and he could not speak, for he was trembling so. A curse had fallen, he knew that truly, but even crueler was the knowledge of divine power that had been demonstrated. Nchylbar also looked pale, uncertain on his feet, but his face shone with not fear, but bliss: the smile of a Dwemer finding evidence for a truth only suspected.\n\nTwo of his students supported him, and two more supported the priest as they left the chamber.\n\n""I have studied much over the years, performed countless experiments, taught myself a thousand languages, and yet the skill that has taught me the final truth is one that I learned when I was but a poor, young man, struggling to earn enough gold so I could eat,"" whispered the sage.\n\nAs he was escorted up the stairs to his bed, a red flower petal fell from the sleeve of his voluminous robe. Nchylbar died that night, a portrait of peace that comes from contented knowledge."

msgid "The Dowry\n\nBy Marobar Sul\n\nYnaleigh was the wealthiest landowner in Gunal, and over the years, he had saved a tremendous dowry for the man who would marry his daughter, Genefra. When she reached the age of consent, he locked the gold away for safe-keeping and announced his intention to have her marry. She was a comely lass, a scholar, a great athlete, but dour and brooding in aspect. This personality defect did not bother her potential suitors any more than her positive traits impressed them. Every man knew the tremendous wealth that would be his as the husband of Genefra and son-in-law of Ynaleigh. That alone was enough for hundreds to come to Gunal to pay court.\n\n""The man who will marry my daughter,"" said Ynaleigh to the assembled, ""must not be doing so purely out of avarice. He must demonstrate his own wealth to my satisfaction.""\n\nThis simple pronouncement removed a vast majority of the suitors, since they knew they could not impress the landowner with their meager fortunes. A few dozen did come forward within a few days, clad in fine killarc cloth of spun silver, accompanied by exotic servants, traveling in magnificent carriages. All who came who met with Ynaleigh's approval, but none arrived in a more resplendent fashion than Welyn Naerillic. The young man, whom no one had ever heard of, arrived in a shining ebon coach drawn by a team of Dragons, his clothing of rarest manufacture. He was accompanied by an army of the most fantastical servants any of Gunal had ever seen. His valets had eyes on all sides of their heads, and his maidservants seemed cast in gemstones.\n\nSuch was not enough for Ynaleigh.\n\n""The man who marries my daughter must prove himself an intelligent fellow, for I would not have an ignoramus as a son-in-law and business partner,"" he declared.\n\nThis eliminated a large part of the wealthy suitors. Through their lives of luxury, they had never needed to think very much, if at all. Still, some came forward over the next few days, demonstrating their wit and learning, quoting the great sages of the past and offering their philosophies of metaphysics and alchemy. Welyn Naerillic also came and asked Ynaleigh to dine at the villa he had rented outside of Gunal. There, the landowner saw scores of scribes working on translations of Aldmeri tracts and enjoyed the young man's somewhat irreverent but intriguing intelligence.\n\nNevertheless, though he was much impressed with Welyn Naerillic, Ynaleigh had another challenge.\n\n""I love my daughter very much,"" said Ynaleigh, ""and I hope that the man who marries her will make her happy as well. Should any of you make her smile, she and the great dowry are yours.""\n\nThe suitors lined up for days, singing her songs, proclaiming their devotion, describing her beauty in the most poetic of terms. Genefra merely glared at all with hatred and melancholia. Ynaleigh stood by her side and began to despair. His daughter's suitors were failing to a man. Finally Welyn Naerillic came to the chamber.\n\n""I will make your daughter smile,"" he said. ""I dare say, I'll make her laugh, but only after you've agreed to marry us. If she is not delighted within one hour of our engagement, the wedding can be called off.""\n\nYnaleigh turned to his daughter. She was not smiling, but her eyes had sparked with some morbid curiosity in this young man. As no other suitor had even registered that for her, he agreed.\n\n""The dowry is naturally not to be paid 'til after you've wed,"" said Ynaleigh. ""Being engaged is not enough.""\n\n""Might I see the dowry still?"" asked Welyn.\n\nKnowing how fabled the treasure was and understanding that this would likely be the closest the young man would come to possessing it, Ynaleigh agreed. He had grown quite found of Welyn. On his orders, Welyn, Ynaleigh, glum Genefra, and the castellan delved deeply into the stronghold of Gunal. The first vault had to be opened by touching a series of runic symbols. Should one of the marks be activated incorrectly, a volley of poisoned arrows would have struck the thief. Ynaleigh was particularly proud of the next level of security: a lock composed of blades with eighteen tumblers that required three keys to be turned simultaneously. The blades were designed to eviscerate any who merely picked one of the locks. Finally, they reached the storeroom.\n\nIt was entirely empty.\n\n""By Lorkhan, we've been burgled!"" cried Ynaleigh. ""But how? Who could have done this?""\n\n""A humble but, if I may say so, rather talented burglar,"" said Welyn. ""A man who has loved your daughter from afar for many years, but did not possess the glamor or the learning to impress. That is, until the gold from her dowry afforded me the opportunity.""\n\n""You?"" bellowed Ynaleigh, scarcely able to believe it. Then something even more unbelievable happened.\n\nGenefra began to laugh. She had never even dreamed of meeting anyone like this thief. She threw herself into his arms before her father's outraged eyes. After a moment, Ynaleigh began to laugh as well.\n\nGenefra and Welyn were married in a month's time. Though he was in fact quite poor and had little scholarship, Ynaleigh was amazed how much his wealth increased with such a son-in-law and business partner.\n\nHe made certain never to ask from whence the excess gold came."

msgid "Chimarvamidium\n\nBy Marobar Sul\n\nAfter many battles, it was clear who would win the war. The Chimer had great skills in magic and swordplay, but against the armored battalions of the Dwemer clad in the finest shielding wrought by Jnaggo, there was little hope of their ever winning. In the interests of keeping some measure of peace in the Land, Sthovin the Warlord agreed to a truce with Karenithil Barif the Beast. In exchange for the Disputed Lands, Sthovin gave Barif a mighty golem that would protect the Chimer's territory from the excursions of the Northern Barbarians.\n\nBarif was delighted with his gift and brought it back to his camp, where all his warriors gaped in awe at it. Sparkling gold in hue, it resembled a Dwemer cavalier with a proud aspect. To test its strength, they placed the golem in the center of an arena and flung magical bolts of lightning at it. Its agility was such that few of the bolts struck it. It had the wherewithal to pivot on its hips to avoid the brunt of the attacks without losing its balance, feet firmly planted on the ground. A volley of fireballs followed, which the golem ably dodged, bending its knees and its legs to spin around the blasts. The few times it was struck, it made certain to be hit in the chest and waist, the strongest parts of its body.\n\nThe troops cheered at the sight of such an agile and powerful creation. With it leading the defense, the Barbarians of Skyrim would never again successfully raid their villages. They named it Chimarvamidium, the Hope of the Chimer.\n\nBarif had the golem brought to his chambers with all his housethanes. There they tested Chimarvamidium further, its strength, its speed, its resiliency. They could find no flaw with its design.\n\n""Imagine when the naked barbarians first meet this on one of their raids,"" laughed one of the housethanes.\n\n""It is only unfortunate that it resembles a Dwemer instead of one of our own,"" mused Karenithil Barif. ""It is revolting to think that they will have a greater respect for our other enemies than us.""\n\n""I think we should never accepted the peace terms that we did,"" said another, one of the most aggressive of the housethanes. ""Is it too late to surprise the warlord Sthovin with an attack?""\n\n""It is never too late to attack,"" said Barif, ""but what of his great armored warriors?""\n\n""I understand,"" said Barif's spymaster, ""that his soldiers always wake at dawn. If we strike an hour before, we can catch them defenseless before they've had a chance to bathe, let alone don their armor.""\n\n""If we capture their armorer Jnaggo, then we too would know the secrets of blacksmith,"" said Barif. ""Let it be done. We will attack tomorrow, an hour before dawn.""\n\nSo it was settled. The Chimer army marched at night and swarmed into the Dwemer camp. They were relying on Chimarvamidium to lead the first wave, but it malfunctioned and began attacking the Chimer's own troops. Added to that, the Dwemer were fully armored, well-rested, and eager for battle. The surprise was turned, and most of the high-ranking Chimer, including Karenithil Barif the Beast, were captured.\n\nThough they were too proud to ask, Sthovin explained to them that he had been warned of their attack by a Calling from one of his men.\n\n""What man of yours is in our camp?"" sneered Barif.\n\nChimarvamidium, standing erect by the side of the captured, removed its head. Within its metal body was Jnaggo, the armorer.\n\n""A Dwemer child of eight can create a golem,"" he explained, ""but only a truly great warrior and armorer can pretend to be one."""

msgid "The Importance of Where\n\nBy Marobar Sul\n\nThe chieftain of Othrobar gathered his wise men together and said, ""Every morning a tenfold of my flock are found butchered. What is the cause?""\n\nFangbith the Warleader said, ""A monster may be coming down from the Mountain and devouring your flock.""\n\nGhorick the Healer said, ""A strange new disease perhaps is to blame.""\n\nBeran the Priest said, ""We must sacrifice to the Goddess for her to save us.""\n\nThe wise men made sacrifices, and while they waited for their answers from the Goddess, Fangbith went to Mentor Joltereg and said, ""You taught me well how to forge the Cudgel of Zolia, and how to wield it in combat, but I must know now when it is wise to use my skill. Do I wait for the Goddess to reply or the medicine to work, or do I hunt the monster that I know is in the mountain?""\n\n""When is not important,"" said Joltereg. ""Where is all that is important.""\n\nSo Fangbith took his Zolic cudgel in hand and walked far through the dark forest until he came to the base of the Great Mountain. There he met two monsters. One, bloodied with the flesh of the chieftain of Othrobar's flock, fought him while its mate fled. Fangbith remembered what his master had taught him, that ""where"" was all that was important.\n\nHe struck the monster on each of its five vital points: head, groin, throat, back, and chest. With five blows to the five points, the monster was slain. It was too heavy to carry with him, but still triumphant, Fangbith returned to Othrobar.\n\n""I say I have slain the monster that ate your flock,"" he cried.\n\n""What proof have you that you have slain a monster?"" asked the chieftain.\n\n""I say I have saved the flock with my medicine,"" said Ghorick the Healer.\n\n""I say the Goddess has saved the flock by my sacrifices,"" said Beran the Priest.\n\nTwo mornings went by and the flocks were safe, but on the morning of the third day, another tenfold of the chieftain's flock was found butchered. Ghorick the Healer went to his study to find a new medicine. Beran the Priest prepared more sacrifices. Fangbith took his Zolic cudgel in hand again, and he walked far through the dark forest until he came to the base of the Great Mountain. There he met the other monster, bloodied with the flesh of the chieftain of Othrobar's flock. They did battle, and again Fangbith remembered what his master had taught him, that ""where"" was all that was important.\n\nHe struck the monster five times on the head and it fled. Chasing it along the mountain, he struck it five times in the groin and it fled. Running through the forest, Fangbith overtook the monster and struck it five times in the throat and it fled. Entering into the fields of Othrobar, Fangbith overtook the monster and struck it five times in the back and it fled. At the foot of the stronghold, the chieftain and his wise men emerged to the sound of the monster wailing. There they beheld the monster that had slain the chieftain's flock. Fangbith struck the monster five times in the chest and it was slain.\n\nA great feast was held in Fangbith's honor, and the flock of Othrobar was never again slain. Joltereg embraced his student and said, ""You have at last learned the importance of where you strike your blows."""

msgid "The Seed\n\nThe hamlet village of Lorikh was a quiet, peaceful Dwemer community nestled in the grey and tan dunes and boulders of the Dejasyte. No vegetation of any kind grew in Lorikh, though there were blackened vestiges of long-dead trees scattered throughout the town. Arriving by caravan, Kamdida looked at her new home with despair. She was used to the forestland of the north, where her father's family had hailed from. Here there was no shade, little water, and a great open sky. The land looked dead.\n\nHer mother's family took Kamdida and her younger brother Nevith in, and they were very kind to the orphans, but she felt lonely in the alien village. It was not until she met an old Argonian woman who worked at the water factory that Kamdida found a friend. Her name was Sigerthe, and she said that her family had lived in Lorikh centuries before the Dwemer arrived, when it was a great and beauteous forest.\n\n""Why did the trees die?"" asked Kamdida.\n\n""When there were Argonians only in this land, we never cut trees, for we had no need for fuel or wooden structures such as you possess. When the Dwemer came, we allowed them to use the plants as they needed them, provided they never touched the Hist, which were sacred to us and to the land. For many years, we lived peaceably. No one wanted for anything.""\n\n""What happened?""\n\n""Some of your scientists discovered that by distilling a certain tree sap, molding it, and drying it, they could create a resilient kind of armor called resin,"" said Sigerthe. ""Most of the trees that grew here had very thin ichor in their branches, but not the Hist. Many of them fairly glistened with sap, which made the Dwemer merchants greedy. They hired a woodsman named Juhnin to start clearing the sacred arbors for profit.""\n\nThe old Argonian woman looked to the dusty ground and sighed. ""Of course, the Argonians cried out against it. It was our home, and the Hist, once gone, would never return. The merchants reconsidered, but Juhnin took it on his own to break our spirit. He proved one terrible, bloody day that his prodigious skill with the axe could be used against people as well as trees. Any Argonian who stood in his way was hewn asunder. The Dwemer people of Lorikh closed their doors and their ears to the cries of murder.""\n\n""Horrible,"" gasped Kamdida.\n\n""It is difficult to explain,"" said Sigerthe, ""but the deaths of our living ones was not nearly as horrible to us as the death of our trees. You must understand that to my people, the Hist are where we come from and where we are going. Destroying our bodies is nothing. Destroying our trees annihilates us utterly. When Juhnin turned his axe on the Hist, he killed the land. The water disappeared, the animals died, and all the other life that the trees nourished crumbled and dried to dust.""\n\n""Then why are you still here?"" asked Kamdida. ""Why didn't you leave?""\n\n""We are trapped. I am one of the last of a dying people. Few of us are strong enough to live away from our ancestral groves, and sometimes, even now, there is a perfume in the air of Lorikh that gives us life. It will not be long until we are all gone.""\n\nKamdida felt tears welling up in her eyes. ""Then I will be alone in this horrible place with no trees and no friends.""\n\n""We Argonians have an expression,"" said Sigerthe with a sad smile, taking Kamdida's hand. ""The best soil for a seed is found in your heart.""\n\nKamdida looked into the palm of her hand and saw that Sigerthe had given her a small black pellet. It was a seed. ""It looks dead.""\n\n""It can only grow in one place in all Lorikh,"" said the old Argonian. ""Outside an old cottage in the hills outside town. I cannot go there, for the owner would kill me on sight. Like all my people, I am too frail to defend myself now, but you can go there and plant the seed.""\n\n""What will happen?"" asked Kamdida. ""Will the Hist return?""\n\n""No, but some part of their power will.""\n\nThat night, Kamdida stole from her house and into the hills. She knew the cottage Sigerthe had mentioned. As she approached it, the door opened and an old but powerfully built man appeared with a mighty axe slung over his shoulder.\n\n""What are you doing here, child?"" he demanded. ""In the dark, I almost took you to be a lizard-man.""\n\n""I've lost my way in the dark. I'm trying to get back to Lorikh.""\n\n""Be on your way then.""\n\n""Do you have a candle I might have?"" she asked piteously. ""I've been walking in circles, and I'm afraid I'll only return back here without light.""\n\nThe old man grumbled and walked into his house. Quickly, Kamdida dug a hole in the dry dirt and buried the seed as deeply as she could. He returned with a lit candle.\n\n""See to it you don't come back here,"" he growled, ""or I'll chop you in half.""\n\nHe returned to his house. The next morning, when he awoke and opened the door, he found that his cottage was entirely sealed within an enormous tree. He picked up his axe and delivered blow and after blow to the wood, but he could never break through. He tried side chops, but the wood healed itself. He tried an upper chop, but the wood sealed.\n\nMuch time went by before someone discovered old Juhnin's emaciated body lying in front of his open door, still holding his blunted, broken axe. What he'd been chopping with it was a mystery, but the rumor spread that Hist sap was found on the blade.\n\nShortly thereafter, small flowers began pushing up through the town's dry dirt. The Hist did not return, but at twilight the shadows of great trees would fill the streets."
