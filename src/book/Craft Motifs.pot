msgid "By Centurion Ancrus Vesnentia of the Shields of Senchal, Thirteenth Legion\n\nSouthern Elsweyr resisted our arrival when Emperor Aquilarious gave the order. Considering the brutality that plagued the countryside for nearly two decades beforehand, it only makes sense. The Thirteenth Legion prepared for such circumstances, however, and I believe that preparedness won us the trust of the Khajiit over time. We came to restore order to Southern Elsweyr, but we stayed to protect its people. Over time, the Khajiit began to call us the Shields of Senchal. \n\nSWORDS\n\nAll recruits start with a sword to learn the fundamentals of the blade. A sword must, above all else, be dependable. Given the variety of enemies in Southern Elsweyr, a good blade must cut them down with brutal, reliable efficiency. Save for the carvings along the hilt, we tend to be fairly straightforward with our blades. Simple or no, our blades possess considerable weight in order to cleave through enemies, whether they be as sturdy as the Mountain Bristleback or frail as an inept scavenger."

msgid "By Fadai, Arcane Quartermaster, Order of the New Moon\n\nSome believe that the Order of the New Moon grows too quickly. The fear and confusion felt upon witnessing the rage of Dragons has led many into our ranks. This one says the newcomers should be embraced! Lord Laatvulon offers his protection to all wise enough to accept it. Of course, production of the required priestly garments will need to increase. Fadai gladly offers guidance on crafting vestments and how best to incorporate the aeonstones into their designs.\n\nGLOVES\n\nManipulating aeonstone can be delicate work. Thus, our gloves expose the fingers while still offering protection. Spikes of aeonstone along the forearms allow the wearer to harness their absorption power while casting magic."

Spikes of aeonstone along the forearms allow the wearer to harness their absorption power while casting magic.\n\nHELMETS\n\nWhen Fadai was first presented with the spiked design of our priestly hoods, this one was skeptical. But Fadai has seen first-hand the terror that they evoke in our foes. Embedding the aeonstone directly into the helm allows direct access to their magical gifts.\n\nLEG GREAVES\n\nThe duties of priests of the New Moon call for violence more often than typical religious followers. Our greaves are flexible enough so that they don't hinder the wearer, but provide the hardy protection needed to defend lord Laatvulon's mission.\n\nMACES\n\nA series of sharp blades resembling a Dragon's majestic wings ring the head of our maces. We intend these to be as instructive as they are decorative. The blades bite and tear like lord Laatvulon's jaw, so that the victim remembers exactly who the wielder represents.\n\nSHIELDS\n\nWith the clever use of aeonstone and dense steel, our shields describe our Order's mission for those foolish enough to oppose us. The prophecied Dark Aeon, wings spread wide, ascends into the night sky to become our New Moon .\n\nSHOULDER ARMOR\n\nWe've designed our pauldrons as tiered steel plates wrapped with dark leather bands. The splayed layers evoke the scales of our Dragon lord and the edges are sharpened to points for extra defense. Aeonstone spikes jut from the tops to give the wearer access to their abilities.\n\nSTAVES\n\nIf any might be confused as to who the Order considers supreme, we have placed a Dragon's terrible image onto the head of our staves. We craft these from dark ironwood for a satisfying heft. Aeonstones are embedded in the crest so that casters may amplify their spellcraft with them.\n\nSWORDS\n\nSome who claim to worship Dragons will craft their blades to curve into claws. The Order knows that we are destined to ascent higher. Our swords are forged straight, with the image of our lord on the guard. When held aloft, they point directly to where the New Moon will form in the night sky."

Adorn your staves with symbols of their wings, flames, and claws to remind you of this.\n\nSWORDS\n\nThe curved blades of the Akaviri are deceptively strong for their lightness. We do not possess the materials to recreate them, but we can borrow some of their traits to improve our own formidable scimitars."

Sidura has tested these daggers herself and finds them to be her favorite of all daggers!\n\nGLOVES\n\nUse flexible gloves for nimble fighting or choose metal gauntlets to help stop blows from landing! We restored the hand armor we found with an eye toward ensuring you could continue to grasp your weapon while dealing with Dragon shouts. Sidura thinks the old Dragonguard would approve.\n\nHELMETS\n\nElements of the Dragonguard symbol embellish the headgear, along with horsehair crests. At least, Sidura thinks they are horsehair. Yet, wouldn't horsehair have disintegrated by now? Perhaps the crests aren't horsehair. A mystery!\n\nLEG GREAVES\n\nThe Dragonguard knew that you had to be nimble while fighting Dragons, so their leg armor takes that into account. You might not like tucking and rolling to avoid a Dragon's attack, but you won't die because your greaves prevent it! Sidura approves!\n\nMACES\n\nSidura recommends you handle the maces with care. The flanges on the two-handed versions are large, but even the one-handed flanges can bite. This one appreciates their ability to penetrate Dragon scale and hide, yet does not appreciate the cut she nurses currently due to these sharp flanges.\n\nSHIELDS\n\nAh, the shields! They show off the Dragonguard symbol exquisitely well! Duck behind one to protect yourself from Dragon breath! And you can smash in someone's face with them. Or a Dragon's snout. They do call them snouts, yes? Forgive me. Sidura is new to Dragon fighting.\n\nSHOULDERS\n\nSidura once took a shoulder slice, so she knows well the value of protecting your shoulders. These pieces match the rest of the armor, though this one added some more embellishment. The arm cops and pauldrons even feature a fabric accent. Sweet, yes?\n\nSTAVES\n\nSidura is not a staff fighter, but this staff tempts her. It looks impressive. This one loves the red gems they used. Draws the eye, yes? Just do not sleep with this staff next to you if you have a mane. The ornate head on this staff tangles badly with longer hair.\n\nSWORDS\n\nLooking at the sword made Sidura wonder: Why the serrations near the guard? What does this say about the Dragonguard fighting style? Is there a part of a Dragon you can entrap? Then Sidura realized: Dragonguard warriors must have had to fight people with weapons, too! So versatile!"

Like Alkosh himself, these weapons strike with perfect force—leaving flesh intact while pulverizing the bone and sinew beneath. \n\nSHIELDS\n\nA Sunspire adept knows the value of quickness, but sometimes even the swiftest paws are not enough. In those times, we might reach for one of our flawless shields. Smith-adepts affix multiple plates to a central aegis, then lace it with prayer cords to create a sturdy, but visually pleasing work of art!\n\nSHOULDERS\n\nAll Sunspire shoulder armor, from the simplest epaulets to the strongest pauldrons, honor Alkosh with prayerful motifs and woven prayer cords. Our arms may not bear the sublime weight of a Dragon's wings, but we must protect them nonetheless!\n\nSTAVES\n\nAh, old age! It is a curse, it's true. In the days before Alkosh's return, I often leaned on cedarwood walking sticks and the like. Now, though? Now I steady myself on one of our mighty staves—proud weapons that bear the phases of Jone and Jode emblazoned on precious metal disks. Great power swirls within their headpieces. With Alkosh's blessing, we shall use that power to lead the Khajiit to enlightenment!\n\nSWORDS\n\nOur Sunspire swords are like the mighty claws of Alkosh himself—beautiful, intimidating, and razor-sharp. While these blades honor our beloved First Cat above all other deities, the blessed crescents of Jone and Jode appear on the crossguard, the pommel, and the blade itself. Truly, there is no holier weapon in all of Elsweyr."

Given the weapon's heft and size, the usual Khajiiti martial skills of quick strikes and deft dodges are unable to be fully utilized. And so the Anequine mace is solid and heavy, good for bashing in the skulls of enemies with strong, precise strikes."

Khajiit who commission such shields will often request specific phases that represent important events in their lives; their birth, the death of a loved one, even the night of their first kill. When you receive such a shield, remember that there is a story carved into its gemstones.\n\nSHOULDER ARMOR\n\nYes, the Khajiiti are a practical people, but Nala-do can justifiably claim that we have a certain sense of style as well. This can be most easily seen in the design of Anequine shoulder armor. Though these pieces are sturdy and lightweight, as all other pieces of Anequine armor are, this one is proud to note how beautifully carved they are as well.\n\nSTAVES\n\nOnly a fool underestimates the Khajiit who wields an Anequine staff. In the paws of a mage, these elegant staves produce powerful spells and evocations. In a claw-dancer's paws, it can be used to strike quick and lethal blows. Whomever the user, you can expect this beautifully balanced and sturdy staff to help its wielder outlast many difficult battles.\n\nSWORDS\n\nThere are few sights more awe-inspiring than a claw-dancer under the Moons, their curved blade twirling through the air like ripples of moonlight. And there is no finer blade than those found on an Anequine sword, perfectly balanced and deadly sharp. Even in the hands of the most novice of warriors, this weapon can cleave through armor and flesh alike."

Other artistic touches include the scales from scale armor as well as stylized feathers.\n\nBOOTS\n\nFollowers of Meridia favor metals even in the lightest armor, as their boots show. With the familiar touches of energy symbolism, these boots are not so much made for stealth as they are designed to withstand blows from necromancers and other typical enemies of Meridia. \n\nBOWS\n\nThe quiver and bow of the Meridian style emulate those seen on Meridian statues in Tamriel. Feathered wings, though soft-seeming in the realm of ideas, come to deadly points on the bow, making movement from ranged to melee combat more fluid.\n\nCHEST PIECES\n\nThe imagery of energy dominates the artistically wrought metalwork of the chest armor of Meridia's adherents, which also utilizes scale armor. Tassets both protect cultists and allow them to use their bodies to unbalance opponents.\n\nDAGGERS\n\nThe daggers Meridian cultists use are especially valuable for catching the blades of their foes, tangling them temporarily and potentially even disarming them.\n\nGLOVES\n\nThe gloves worn by those revering Meridia enable them to block both blade and arrow, ensuring that they can move into and out of close-range combat with minimized risk—a preferred tactic. As the light ebbs and flows each day, so too do cultists of Meridia in combat.\n\nHELMETS\n\nAs evidenced by the metal rays emanating from the headgear worn by Meridian cultists, those fighting in her name are not afraid to threaten to eviscerate their foes with their heads.\n\nLEG GREAVES\n\nMastery of motion is a cornerstone in the fighting techniques of those revering Meridia, thus the primary material used in leg armor is supple leather. Metal augments the protective nature of this armor to some degree, but only mildly so.\n\nMACES\n\nDue to necromancers and their minions being a common enemy of Meridia, the maces of Meridian cultists are crafted primarily to splinter the bones of skeletons and sweep away less limber undead. Of course, these weapons also deal the ultimate punishment to those practicing necromancy, too.\n\nSHIELDS\n\nWings, rays of energy, and the flow of light decorate the shields of those following Meridia. Multiple sharp edges on these shields also allow Meridian cultists to make particularly gory shield bashes.\n\nSHOULDER ARMOR\n\nMetal provides a perfect medium for artistic touches such as flowing lines that represent the energy of Meridia. Even the lightest armored adherent of Meridia can use the metal shoulder armor to enhance the impact of full-body moves to overwhelm a foe.\n\nSTAVES\n\nMeridia's true form—that of light and vibration—are represented best by the use of crystals in her followers' weapons, such as the three present in staves. As noted in an otherwise incoherent Meridian cultist's journal: ""Light and vibration affect crystals, so carrying crystals into battle allows Meridia to bless our moves directly.""\n\nSWORDS\n\nThe design of Meridian swords allows them to better parry their foes' attacks. Cultists often use this tactic when first wading into close combat with foes. When fighting against skeletons and the like, the swords can even snap bones with a simple quick twist."

The similarity of designs and motifs found during our expeditions across Black Marsh suggest that the Argonians once may have had a more unified civilization, or perhaps simply traded more widely.\n\nMACES\n\nWar bludgeons we recovered from a sunken foundry were impressive. Made largely of bronze, these weapons must have been wielded by warriors of great stature. Though it is the striking ends that are the most interesting features. Usually styled after Argonian heads, the designs were angular—almost geometric—and familiar, as was the metal it was cast from."

Knee- and ankle-length skirts and pants were often layered with other frilled skirts and dangling drapery. Warriors favored a top layer of rigid leather or woven reeds reinforced by bronze and bone."

Most had prominent ornamentation above the face and employed feather plumes, jewels, and great brass icons as decoration. Impractical as it may seem, these headdresses were even worn into battle over leather hoods."

The similarity of designs and motifs found during our expeditions across Black Marsh suggest that the Argonians once may have had a more unified civilization, or perhaps simply traded more widely.\n\nGLOVES\n\nMuch like their descendants, elder Argonians found gloves impractical. They either used a fingerless mitt that hooked upon the thumb, or hand wraps like those favored by pit fighters. Cloth or leather bracers were commonly worn for decoration and protection, some of the latter mounting rigid metal splints for war. Frilled bands around upper arms were also nearly universal adornments."

The prevalence of volcanic glass in so many weapons was quite surprising, given that there isn't any known volcanic activity within Black Marsh itself. That suggests the Argonians may have regularly ventured into what we now call Morrowind."

This might have been to keep their frills and spines uncovered for communication. Armor was almost entirely constructed from bronze splints and mostly covered the shoulders and abdomen, suggesting that their own scales were expected to protect the exposed flanks and back."

Perhaps they regarded the arrow as an extension of the Hist's will, like some fatal decree, though it might have been just the most readily available source of wood."

Rubber-soled sandals were uniform among all walks of life, though fringed leg wraps, anklets, and shin guards were frequent accompaniments for those of high status."

Warriors would employ sturdier reptile hide belts over these sashes as an anchor for arms and armor. Emblems, worn at what would be our navel, often bore Sithis iconography."

These war axes consist of one or two large shards of volcanic glass mounted in a brassy alloy and adorned with feathers, dyed yarns, and gold. This degree of metalwork is almost nonexistent in contemporary Black Marsh."

msgid "By Concordia Mercius\n\nI am proud to present, on behalf of Cyrodilic Collections, my findings on pre-Duskfall Argonian raiment and adornment. The similarity of designs and motifs found during our expeditions across Black Marsh suggest that the Argonians once may have had a more unified civilization, or perhaps simply traded more widely.\n\nAXES\n\nThe only elder axes we have recovered were clearly weapons of war, leading me to believe that mere tools might not have been created with the same care and grade of material. These war axes consist of one or two large shards of volcanic glass mounted in a brassy alloy and adorned with feathers, dyed yarns, and gold. This degree of metalwork is almost nonexistent in contemporary Black Marsh.\n\nBELTS\n\nBelts were almost entirely decorative, consisting of expertly woven cloth sashes sometimes adorned with gold chains, rings, or colorful cord. Warriors would employ sturdier reptile hide belts over these sashes as an anchor for arms and armor. Emblems, worn at what would be our navel, often bore Sithis iconography.\n\nBOOTS\n\nElder Argonians used more footwear than many modern tribes, though they still favored open designs that allowed them to keep their feet immersed. Rubber-soled sandals were uniform among all walks of life, though fringed leg wraps, anklets, and shin guards were frequent accompaniments for those of high status.\n\nBOWS\n\nWe still know little about the elder Argonians' relationship with the Hist, but I believe that the bows we've recovered were made from Hist wood. Perhaps they regarded the arrow as an extension of the Hist's will, like some fatal decree, though it might have been just the most readily available source of wood.  \n\nCHEST PIECES\n\nElder Argonians preferred light sashes and wraps over tunics. This might have been to keep their frills and spines uncovered for communication. Armor was almost entirely constructed from bronze splints and mostly covered the shoulders and abdomen, suggesting that their own scales were expected to protect the exposed flanks and back.\n\nDAGGERS\n\nRegardless of length, elder Argonian blades were made from a series of volcanic glass shards set in a beaten bronze channel. The prevalence of volcanic glass in so many weapons was quite surprising, given that there isn't any known volcanic activity within Black Marsh itself. That suggests the Argonians may have regularly ventured into what we now call Morrowind.\n\nGLOVES\n\nMuch like their descendants, elder Argonians found gloves impractical. They either used a fingerless mitt that hooked upon the thumb, or hand wraps like those favored by pit fighters. Cloth or leather bracers were commonly worn for decoration and protection, some of the latter mounting rigid metal splints for war. Frilled bands around upper arms were also nearly universal adornments.\n\nHELMETS\n\nA simple circlet or headband acted as the base upon which many styles of headwear could be built. Most had prominent ornamentation above the face and employed feather plumes, jewels, and great brass icons as decoration. Impractical as it may seem, these headdresses were even worn into battle over leather hoods.\n\nLEG GREAVES\n\nWhere a simple loincloth is one of the more widely preferred pieces of legwear among tribal Argonians now, their ancestors swaddled themselves in elaborate layers. Knee- and ankle-length skirts and pants were often layered with other frilled skirts and dangling drapery. Warriors favored a top layer of rigid leather or woven reeds reinforced by bronze and bone.\n\nMACES\n\nWar bludgeons we recovered from a sunken foundry were impressive. Made largely of bronze, these weapons must have been wielded by warriors of great stature. Though it is the striking ends that are the most interesting features. Usually styled after Argonian heads, the designs were angular—almost geometric—and familiar, as was the metal it was cast from. \n\nSHIELDS\n\nMaybe it was the way the glass teeth along the rim reminded me of a cog, or the orange tinge of the shield's face, or the boxy scrollwork, but the answer to the nagging familiarity I felt with elder Argonian metalwork struck me like one of their maces: Dwarven influence. Black Marsh may not always have been as insular a province as it is these days.\n\nSHOULDERS\n\nUsually a combination of leather and bronze, shoulder guards consisted of nothing more than a simple curved pad and a strap to loop through the pit of the arm. Rather than being shaped to fit over the shoulder, many simply projected upward—some as high as the wearer's jaw, making them something of a neck-guard as well. \n\nSTAVES\n\nStaves were primarily instruments of the priesthood of Sithis. Many of these bronze rods were capped with icons and symbols of the Great Serpent to whom the priests made their sacrifices, but some bore razor-sharp, glass teeth intended to spill blood in many of their ceremonies. All evidence points toward Sithis playing a more central role in ancient Argonian worship than in modern day, at least among most tribes.\n\nSWORDS\n\nWe didn't understand why volcanic glass was preferred for blades when the ancient Argonians already possessed the capacity for metalwork. In testing one of the glass swords, we quickly learned that the brutal sharpness was frightening for as long as the glass remained intact. It's also easy to replace in the field and lighter than metal sharpening equipment."

msgid "By Bolu, Reel-Ka of the Dead-Water Tribe\n\nMy quill will write the truth words. Dead-Water warriors defend the tribe in both life and death. Many travelers find this tradition morbid. They speak of defiling our fallen kin. It is not so. To craft a weapon from the skin and bones of our warriors, this is honoring.\n\nAXES\n\nA proper axe requires a leg bone. This, the Dead-Water know. It is the only bone long and thick enough to support the axe head. Male bones are best for this because of their thickness. Female bones are too flexible, better suited for blades. By wielding this axe with strength, we honor a fallen warrior.\n\nBELTS\n\nDead-Water Tribe is not renowned for beautiful creations. This is known. Still, our leatherworkers decorate the belts of our warriors. They carve intricate buckles from amber and stone. I nod in admittance. This is not necessary, but still, it is nice.\n\nBOOTS\n\nThe mightiest Dead-Water warriors line their boots with sharp spikes. Useful in close combat. With every kick, we hope to pierce the hide of our foes. My egg-mother was able to behead her enemies with one swift kick. This is why I carry her bones in my weapons. I hope to carry her fighting spirit.\n\nBOWS\n\nDead-Water quivers are made from the hardened hide of our fallen. Our bows are lined with their fangs, and our arrowheads created from their bones. After battle, we will salvage what arrows we can. Many will keep broken arrowheads in remembrance.\n\nCHEST PIECES\n\nThe Dead-Water bound our warrior hearts in the skin of our fallen. Atop this, we wear hardened scales from lurking beasts: haj mota, wamasu, hackwing. Our hunters have slayed, our leatherworkers have skinned. And now our warriors proudly wear.\n\nDAGGERS\n\nDead-Water daggers are made from bones of the arm or shin. When finally the blade wears, they are used for eating. I regularly eat with a dagger made from the shin of my egg-sire's egg-sire. He has lasted through many seasons. I do not share this with travelers I meet. They do not understand such things.\n\nGLOVES\n\nI flex my hands. Gloves must be supple. I look upon the metal hands of outsiders with questioning. A Dead-Water warrior must strike quickly. And, should all else fail, we will use our claws to rip and tear. To cover our fingers would be to take away such weapons.\n\nHELMETS\n\nI bow my head, displaying a helmet covered in long horns. It strikes fear into the heart of my foes. Dead-Water warriors must always be prepared for battle. So we place horns upon our helmets. This way, we continually display the spine of aggression. A display that all of Murkmire knows to fear.\n\nLEG GREAVES\n\nTo the front, hardened scale. Behind, supple leather. Dead-Water leg greaves allow for quick movement during battle. Useful in a swamp where the land itself will swallow you whole. This also enables quiet movement. Useful for sneaking towards our enemies. Again, I eye the metal of travelers with distrust. \n\nMACES\n\nDead-Water maces have rounded, curved edges. This was not always so. In my egg-mother's time, skulls were used. They proved far too brittle. Now we place sharp bones atop the heads. Still we honor our ancestors, but now the maces are more durable for battle.\n\nSHIELDS\n\nDead-Water warriors protect in life and death. Their spirits have returned to the Hist. Flesh and bone remain to aid us in battle. I bow my head in respect. We show this most clearly with our shields. The skin of our fallen are stretched across the wood. Their bones decorate the sides.\n\nSHOULDERS\n\nOur shoulders proudly display spikes of bone. Should the wamasu try to crush us? Should our foes crash against us? The Dead-Water will drop their shoulders, bringing them up for a mighty blow. With skill, a bone will crack or sinew will tear. I will confess, such spikes also add awe to the look of our armor.  \n\nSTAVES\n\nDead-Water staff is as dangerous as our blades. Its amber gem is soaked in the sap of the Hist. From this, its power is absorbed. Only the bones of our fallen mages will create such weapons. By this, they lend their magical essence to another. Or so it is believed.\n\nSWORDS\n\nDead-Water swords are only held by our most cunning of warriors. Its jagged back can easily cut its wielder, should they not be careful. I bow in reverence. My blade is a most prized possession. Crafted from the leg bone of my egg-mother. Even still she fights by my side."

Only equipment that is well and properly made will be accepted into the Welkynar Armory. \n\nAXES\n\nWelkynar axe heads are adorned with stylized golden gryphons, because what else would be on them? The blades themselves are of dark carbon steel, mounted on a long haft of studded ash wood ending in a hooked metal ferrule. \n\nBELTS\n\nThe Welkynar's plumed war girdle supports gilded metal tassets and is cinched in the front by a buckle in the shape of a stylized gryphon's head. As an aerial order, we must avoid accruing undue weight wherever possible, so metallic materials must be both durable and, above all, light. \n\nBOOTS\n\nThough gilded sandals are sufficient protection to accompany light armor, for heavier load-outs we must have the traditional Golden Gryphon-Talon Sabatons. Copies of the cobbler pattern for these distinctive martial boots may be checked out of the Armory in Cloudrest. \n\nBOWS\n\nThe bows wielded by the Knights of the Welkynar Order are among the most beautiful arms ever created by High Elves, bar none. Each beaked limb ends in an exquisite sweep of carved golden feathers—artful, and yet these are deadly weapons that shoot lethally barbed arrows. It's an irony that reflects the core aesthetics of the order. \n\nCHEST PIECES\n\nAs an aerial order that has to think about flight weight, most of our equipment looks heavier than it is. Welkynar cuirasses are a case in point: though they appear to be forged of weighty metal, most of those elements are actually lighter materials such as flexible scale maille or gilded cuir bouilli—boiled leather, if you can believe it! Wing banners attach to the shoulder blades. \n\nDAGGERS\n\nA Welkynar's dagger is made of dark carbon steel and is doubly edged, but it's really a punching dagger so it's the needle-sharp point that counts.  The crossguard evokes gryphon wings, forged thicker and more solid than they appear to enable the dagger to be used as a parrying weapon. \n\nGLOVES\n\nA Welkynar's substantial but intricate gauntlets may be the knight's proudest belongings, since they are among the first items of gear issued to a squire-in-training. If you give any thought to the practical issues of training spirited gryphon mounts, with their powerful, snapping beaks, you'll understand the need for sturdy gauntlets and vambraces! \n\nHELMETS\n\nOur helmets have been rightly described as ""magnificent confections of plumes and gilt,"" with avian motifs such as cheek pieces that resemble gryphon wings, and a forepeak like a gryphon's pointed bill. They were designed by Mornyalemar the Battle-Hardy generations ago, and we see no reason to change them now. \n\nLEG GREAVES\n\nOur resplendent metal poleyns, adorned with gilded wing symbols, certainly draw attention from the rest of our leg armor, cuisses that are functional though less spectacular than our knee bosses. Welkynar greaves consist of light overlapping plates backed by flexible flaxen fabric. \n\nMACES\n\nWhen a Welkynar's mace strikes, with its heavy business end forged in the shape of four beaked gryphon heads, it's as if the entire Aerie of the Order smites its opponent at once! Though the gilded gryphon heads look delicate, they're actually crafted of carbon steel surrounding a solid lead core. \n\nSHIELDS\n\nThe Welkynar's shield, with its overlapping plumage rendered in carbon steel, brass, and copper, represents the inescapable wings of Elven justice and Altmeri martial prowess. Let evildoers who threaten Summerset beware! This land is under Welkynar protection. \n\nSHOULDER ARMOR\n\nWelkynars never tire of avian symbology, so of course our flaring pauldrons evoke the wings of great raptors. Their edges are even feathered with genuine gryphon plumage! (Don't even think of substituting raven feathers.)\n\nSTAVES\n\nA Welkynar's spell staff is topped (of course) with stylized gryphon wings, in this case pointed and parallel like those of a knight's flying mount when put into a power dive, a shape that also evokes the focus of a spellcaster's will. The long ash-wood haft ends in sharp ferrule.      \n\nSWORDS\n\nThe swords of the Knights of the Order of the Welkynar are as straight as our commitment to justice and as long as our heritage of heroism. Inscribed with runes of efficacy and balance, let our enemies beware when these noble weapons are drawn in defense of the Altmer!"

Does Gulibeg the Quick Fox? …At this point, Uraccanach thinks he can let you answer it yourself. \n\nMACES\n\nThe Huntsman's mace is a bone-breaker, its heavy metal head fittingly studded with bone, horn, and antlers. Though it can deliver the coup de grace when needed, it's usually employed to shatter a Prey's leg before it is beheaded with an axe. Wielding the mace calls for strength, for which we pray to Hrokkibeg the Mighty Bear!\n\nSHIELDS\n\nThe Huntsman's kite-shaped shield is large and of thick boiled hide, nearly as strong as metal but much lighter. It bears the antlered visage of Uricanbeg the Great Stag, and is surmounted and bordered with actual stag antlers, lashed to the shield with strips of hart leather. Beat your weapon against it to drum like the Great Stag's hooves! \n\nSHOULDER ARMOR\n\nThough Huntsmen in general favor relatively light armor choices, there is no harm in a good pair of pauldrons—I tell you this as a Witchman from five generations of Witchmen! Pauldrons, they are all right. And they give us one more place to wear horns and spikes, so that is all to the good. \n\nSTAVES\n\nOur spellcasters' staves are topped with the skull-and-antlers totem of Uricanbeg, Lord Hircine's aspect of the Great Stag. Rows of focusing claws line both the staff's lower head and the base of its haft, for as Destruction magic is cast from the front end, so Restoration is cast from the hind.     \n\nSWORDS\n\nSometimes the Prey requires a coup de grace of a thrust to the heart rather than a beheading, and for that task the Huntsman uses the sword. Though the Huntsman's blade is forged of the finest available steel, crossguard and haft are of claws and leather-wrapped bone, more serviceable than ornamental."
