msgid "Mysteries of the Sublime Brazier\nby Augusta Purusius, Associate Historian, Imperial Academy of Records and Histories\n\nIn the brilliant dawn of St. Alessia's rule, Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, bestowed upon her many gifts: wisdom, temperance, vitality, and eventually the Amulet of Kings. The Amulet's role in maintaining Akatosh's compact with men and mer is well-known. Less well-known is the nature of its counterpart, The Sublime Brazier.\n\nThe Brazier is an expertly wrought cauldron, carved to resemble a roost of Dragons. Legends say that the bottom of the cauldron reaches down into the very heart of Nirn, and that the hewn Dragons whisper to each other in a long-dead tongue when no one is near. As to its purpose—the Brazier serves as Akatosh's first light. When kindled, it brings life to the Dragonfires in the city above.\n\nThe Brazier's location is a closely guarded secret. Some say that Alessia's heirs can hear it calling to them through Aethereal ""songs."" This belief has guided many misguided souls into the sewers. The prideful and insane who believe themselves to be Dragonborn descend into the underground, straight into the waiting jaws of the many creatures that lurk there.  But then, this may be the true purpose of the Brazier—to test the strength and guile of any person who would be Emperor. The Imperial Sewers do not suffer fools. If you do not hear the songs, do not seek the Brazier."

msgid "My name is Glyndallagan, and this is my confession.\n\nI should begin at the beginning—as if there were such a thing. I came to the city as a mage of modest means. Nothing but holes in my pockets, and a rattling cart full of knickknacks. I suppose you could consider me a con-man. My game was simple: lure affluent, small-minded people to my cart and make a wager. ""I bet you—"" I said, ""I bet you I can turn whatever you have in your pocket into an apple."" Of course it wasn't always apples. It could be a thimble, or a button, or an old shoe. Inevitably, they would bite and take up the bet. I would cast a simple translocative spell, whisking their item into my cart, and replacing it with whatever garbage I had managed to gather up the day before. Such a transfer is child's-play when compared to an actual transmutation. Thus, my gain was two-fold: I acquired whatever item they happened to be carrying around, as well as the balance of the wager. This earned me a decent living for a while. Until I ran into the Rattle-Man.\n\nHe was tall, certainly—and very, very thin. And when he walked, his coin-purse made an unnerving clatter. A rattling of what sounded like bone on bone. I didn't have to flag him down, or lay out my pitch. He simply reached into his pocket and produced a handful of random objects. Teeth, bone chips, glowing shards …. His silence was unsettling, and the items were so random and macabre I could barely keep my composure. But I was greedy then. Greedy, and foolish. \n\nHe eventually spoke in a low, rasping voice, ""Shall we make a wager?""\n\n""Of course!"" I said. ""Eight drakes for eight trinkets!""\n\n""Make it fifty drakes if you succeed. And if you fail …."" he replied.\n\nA fifty drake wager! It took me a moment to process this. I had never even considered the results of a failure. ""Well, if I fail, I suppose I'll owe you fifty drakes."" This seemed to rub him the wrong way. He put the items in his pocket and turned to leave.\n\nEven now, I will wake from a dead sleep, gasping over the horror of this moment. Reliving it in my mind, over and over. If I had just let him walk away. If I had been distracted by another mark, or taken my lunch early, all of this might have been avoided. But as I said, I was greedy and foolish. I shouted over his shoulder, ""What would you have instead, sir?""\n\nHe turned on his heel and smiled. At least I think it was a smile. I don't remember his face, you see? No one ever remembers his face. He spoke in a whisper, ""I only want a vow that you'll return the items to me when the trick is done.""\n\nHe knew my game. No corner-cob hustler would weave a transmutation spell for five drakes. He knew I just took the items into my cart via a translocation cantrip. So why worry? I would simply reach into my cart and hand him the items after the spell was cast. There was a fear in the pit of my stomach, but I took his clammy, pale hand in mine and shook on it. ""You have my vow,"" I said. And with those four words, my fate was sealed.\n\nI cast the translocation spell as normal. There was a brilliant flash of light, and a puff of colorful smoke. All according to plan. And just as I expected, his handful of terrifying trinkets had been ""transformed"" into a handful of buttons, bent silverware, and scraps of shoe leather.\n\n""Excellent."" he rasped. ""Now, if I could have my items back, we can conclude our wager.""\n\nI was elated. Fifty drakes! Fifty drakes for a small-time hustle. I was practically dancing when I opened the cart. But something was wrong. All my items were gone. Everything. I searched everywhere—my pockets, inside the cart, the street beneath. Nothing. ""It appears that you have failed,"" he said. \n\nAnd thus began my endless service to the Rattle-Man. I will search for his missing items for the rest of my days.\n\nMy life is a curse. My nights are filled with bad dreams, my days with waking terrors. My bones strain and creak. My hair grows thinner and paler by the day. All for a handful of bone scraps and teeth.\n\nSo, I make this compact with you, dear reader. Bring me your frightful trinkets—your bone scraps and bloody claws. Bring them to my trophy vaults, and I will grant you riches beyond imagining. Do not trouble yourself with thoughts of where these riches came from. I have had to become very … resourceful. Scruples are a luxury that the cursed cannot afford. No, only the trinkets matter. \n\nPerhaps one day I will find all of the Rattle-Man's trinkets. And on that day, I will kill myself and leave this accursed world behind."

msgid "Honored members of the Elder Council,\n\nIt is with great pride that I report we have finally found the city's legendary Centrata! As you know, the city's underground is a complex nest of sewer drains and crumbling Ayleid ruins. We've always assumed that there was a grand design in their construction, but lacked the requisite resources to prove it. Now, with help from Chancellor Tharn and the wise Mannimarco, we've been able to delve deeper than we ever thought possible.\n\nOur survey indicates that all channels and passages eventually lead to the Centrata, a massive underground chamber that houses the White-Gold Tower's foundation. I can tell you, it is quite a sight to behold. The Tower rests on a stone monopile, supported by six massive vaults. The significance of this discovery cannot be overstated. It confirms countless architectural theories about the six districts' connections to the Tower and the age of the city's infrastructure. It might also grant us valuable insights into the nature of the White-Gold Tower and its power over Nirn.\n\nI would like to conduct a more thorough investigation, but our esteemed benefactor Mannimarco has declared the area off-limits. I do not mean to sound ungrateful. Without his help we never would have found the Centrata. But we still have a great deal to learn about how the chamber was constructed. I hope that the Elder Council might intercede on our behalf.\n\nBest regards, \n\nMycaelis Julus, Imperial Architect, Council for Civic Planning"

msgid "By Pelagius Habor, Council Daedrologist-in-Residence\n\nDaedrology is a science born of catastrophe. Our greatest discoveries are always written down on charred parchment by an unsteady hand—and so it is with me. The Planemeld has dramatically enhanced our understanding of the Daedra, but at great cost. I can only hope that my work will survive this latest disaster.\n\nI believe that I am the first to write about Molag Bal's elite vanguard, the Xivkyn. The term ""Xivkyn"" is, of course, heavily Cyrodilicized—a crude portmanteau referencing their resemblance to both Xivilai and Dremora. And in fact, they are a hybrid race ""bred"" by Molag Bal to be his personal guard. They refer to themselves by many names; Stolavryk, Khimrykif, or Vyrsago depending on the hour. While they detest all mortal races, they reserve a particular hatred for their confederates, the Dremora. Xivkyn appear to place great emphasis on loyalty, making the Dremora's defection from Mehrunes Dagon an unforgivable sin.\n\nOf all the Daedra, Xivkyn are the most like Molag Bal. They share his unquenchable thirst for mortal souls and his obsession with the acquisition of soul gems. This drive to ""collect"" strikes me as a kind of madness, akin to those suffering from advanced vampirism. While I've never witnessed a physical confrontation between Xivkyn, they routinely scheme against one another in an attempt to gain more soul gems. These plots are commonplace and rarely result in censure from higher ranking Daedra. \n\nDespite the intrigues, the Xivkyn maintain a rigid code of military efficiency. Their fierce loyalty to Molag Bal combined with their physical and arcane might make them the most terrifying arrival since the Daedric Titan. While I'm sure there's much more to learn, I'm ready for this particular study to end."

msgid "On the Nature of Tel Var Stones, Vol. IV\nby Herminius Sophus\nThe Conclusive Nature of Tel Var Stones:\n\nThe first thing to be gleaned from this weighty work, is a keen grasp of the connection between the Tel Var Stones themselves and the many unique applications of Magic. Physically, they appear to be unblemished stones of undeniable magical radiance—but when examined by an an educated mind, it is clear that they are somehow imbued with more magical power than any other such objects that have yet been studied. One could speculate that the Ayleids could not produce such power themselves, so perhaps they mined these stones without substantial modification from a long emptied quarry of magical concentrate. Or perhaps they tapped into a nexus of interwoven magical threads from beyond Nirn. Or perhaps they created this material from the works, or even corpuses, of long deceased scholars. All of these hypotheses are just that, and should not be considered fact without further evidence. The methods described within Volume 2 are but one way of discovering the effluvia of Magic mixt with the Stone. There may still be others. Dwemer contraptions designed to investigate such magical phenomena are known to have once existed. An instrument of such technological sophistication might yield more data concerning the origin of these Tel Var Stones, and ultimately how these Stones may be useful for further academic experimentation."

msgid "On the Nature of Tel Var Stones, Vol. III \nby Herminius Sophus\nAn Observation of Tel Var Stones and the Schools of Magic:\n\nI am certain that all true alchemists will agree that the quality of the prepared Tel Var paste yielded from the rendering process outlined in Volume II of this treatise is of the highest caliber ever studied. Even the most benighted novice must conclude that the Ayleidoon conglomerate rendered by this experiment contains a unique and powerful form of raw magicka. With this assertion firmly established as fact, we shall proceed to the specific properties of the Tel Var slurry.\n\nThe most apparent (and seemingly unsettling to the less educated) property is the enduring warmth of the paste and the steady blush of brilliantly pure light from each granular crystal. This, of course, suggests strong connections to both illusion and restoration. When the now sullied water has been filtered from the thick suspension, the nature of its power can also be made manifest by placing a piece of Orichalcum upon its surface. The mineral will appear to levitate—a clear indication of alteration potential. If examined closely, one should take note that the water has become a solution of a great number of minute white crystals. These particulates often clump together in clots that vibrate in the same manner as conjuring stones. If the slurry itself is combined with any other alchemical property, it may cause localized slowness and weakness to all manner of elemental impairments; an undeniable display of destructive power. Finally, if the Tel Var vapor removed from the alembic in the preceding recipe is examined separately with a single, taut blast of any Destruction spell, the vapor itself seems to reflect this simple affront; a clear property of mysticism. This leads us to the undeniable conclusion that all elements of Magical practice reside within these stones."

The Chief Councilor makes a motion that General Nipia send an armed escort and forcibly ensure that Advisor Tharn attends the next council meeting. General Nipia strongly advises against such a course of action. The matter is held to a vote and the motion is denied.\n\nAfter the vote, Councilor Abor says she's feeling ill, possibly from ingesting spoiled mudcrab in this morning's brunch at the Temple of the Divines.

He requests that the council provide funds for his lieutenants to conduct a thorough internal investigation. No councilor volunteers to make a motion.\n\nGeneral Nipia wants to speak about the matter in greater detail, but his statement is interrupted by a series of significant groundquakes. Captain Norbanus of the Imperial City Guard enters the council chamber to report that a ""Dark Anchor"" has descended just outside the city and that several Daedra have been spotted in the Nobles District.\n\nDue to this report, Councilor Faleria makes a motion that the council meeting be adjourned so the situation can be assessed. The motion is held to a vote and affirmed, but Chief Councilor Lovidicus vetoes the motion.\n \nChief Councilor Lovidicus says the council meeting cannot be adjourned until a vote has been held on High Magistrate Muspidus's request to add Metheglin Perfume to the water supply in the sewers to help alleviate the city-wide stench believed to have been caused by the extra week of feasting during Rain's Hand this year. Councilor Itinia makes a motion to add the perfume. The motion is held to a vote and affirmed. \n\nCouncilor Faleria again makes a motion to adjourn the meeting.

Add filtered water and distill it in an alembic of expert and scholarly make, separating the vapor for separate study. Pour the powdery soup into a calcinator of inferior quality, and only such, as the natural vugginess of the ramekin made from simple materials will prevent the entire mixture from turning to ash. Stir and clear it with an iron ladle, gathering together the whitish curds that swim at the top like rendered fat. When the color of the water is clear no longer (and, in fact, emits a rather odd glow) strew upon it auripigmentum powder equivalent to the initial quantity of the Tel Var Stone powder, plus about as much realgar as will lie upon a half Dwemer coin piece of eighteen or twenty pebble weight. After the auripigmentum and realgar have wed, stir in a capsule of crimson nirnroot powder as well. The powder will flash and glow. When the glow subsides, take out the now iridescent curds with a ladle having a lip or notch in the brim for regimented measurement, and release precisely half of the mixture into a master alchemist retort. Extract a few small drops of the remaining liquid and allow it to trickle out of the dropper into a separate phial of purified water. Please note: if these driblets are round and without tails, then there is not enough Tel Var within—likely due to insufficient heat. If this indeed the case, the recipe is lost, and the magicka held in stasis has been released without study. \n\n(Note that if your assistant is of simple and superstitious mind, this failure may evoke a gentle weeping, as they may believe that some of the essence of Creation has been lost. This is, of course, not the case. You should give your assistant a stern rebuke, as any tolerance of this belief will only foster further ignorance.)"

Such speculation is rubbish, clearly unfounded, and should not color anyone's experimentation on these stones.\n\nAs to the recipe itself, it is imperative that all steps are heeded without deviation.

You're new to the work, so I'll spare you a tongue-lashing. The truth is you'll see a lot of ""ghosts"" here in the Memorial District. The good news is they aren't spooks. They're just plain old grave-robbers. These damned Khajiit cover themselves in flour then scamper around all night looking for trinkets. It would be funny if it weren't such a pain in the arse cleaning up after them.\n\n""What are they looking for"" you ask? Well, you were just a twinkle in your old mum's eye at the time, but this place used to be a market. A damn fine one at that—the best in Cyrodiil. Used to be full of people haggling over spices, and bolts of silk, and fine jewelry. Wish you could have seen it. Anyway, when Varen showed up with his Colovian troops, Leovic's legion made their last stand here. I was still a pup at the time, you see? Spent the better part of a week tucked away in a sewer pipe waiting for it to stop. It was a week solid of sleeping on wet cobblestones and drinking bloody sewer water—hearing nothing but shouting, and clanging steel, and explosions that damn near rattled the teeth out of my head. By the time it was all over, the whole district was gone. And I mean, gone. Wasn't a single thing standing taller than my knee, and I was just nine or ten. Then there were the bodies. Hundreds of them. Thousands maybe. I hope I never have to smell something like that again. Smelled like that dog you dug out from under Elliana's carriage, except you couldn't get away from it. It was everywhere.\n\nSoon as Varen tossed old Leovic in the gutter, he set his men to work gathering up all the bodies and throwing them in mass graves. By the time he was done, there wasn't room for a market anymore. So he converted the whole district into a graveyard. The Memorial District.\n\nBut enough with the history lesson—back to the Khajiit. They've got this fool notion that there are still jewels and such scattered throughout the district. I'll tell you right now, if there were still valuables here, I would have found them. And if I found them, I sure as spit wouldn't still be here turning a spade.\n\nTomorrow, I want you to go to old-man Varus' house. Buy a good, strong bow. Next time you see a ""ghost"" put an arrow in its arse, and see if it sticks. Bet you ten drakes it shrieks like a housecat that got its tail stuck in a door.\n\n— Groundskeeper Gavros"

msgid "Another of my cellmates dead. Typical. There are few mortals with the strength of body, of character, to survive here. But I will add young Vayron to the throne (when the masters have finished with his flesh), to serve me when my own body grows weary.\n \nThough I wish I could do what the masters can. They spend their nights returning the deceased to a semblance of animation, harvesting their skin to create living flesh weapons for the war raging above. Perhaps, one day, they will allow my flesh to serve.\n\nIt's foolish of the generals and the Empress Regent and whatever else remains of the Imperial hierarchy to continue the fight. They should accept Daedric rule; as I have. The Daedra waste nothing, and under them, everyone has a role. Even if that role is serving at the front of a war chariot. As an ornament."

msgid "We are doomed. The Gray Vipers, the Imperial City, the very Empire—all of us. The Daedra cannot be stopped. All that they do they do from impulse. And it is hideous.\n \nYears from today, if anyone remains to find this parchment, they may glean irony in a Gray Viper lamenting his fate after a lifetime of debauchery and criminality. But what I've done as a Viper was in the name of survival. Flourishing as it was before the Daedra invasion, this scholar-in-training found Imperial City didn't provide for everyone. The Gray Vipers allowed me to provide for myself.\n \nThese Daedra, however … they kill us, maim us, infect us with demonic disease, and are enlivened by it. It's an art to them, a creative outlet, to cause agony. And when they run out of mortal bodies to disfigure they venture above to get more. It will be my turn soon, and I would deny whatever grotesque fate they craft for me.\n\nSo I've started a collection. Just scraps of rope and cloth, here and there, pillaged from the bodies we pass when we're marched out of these cells to be paraded and whipped for the Lord Warden's pleasure. By week's end, I'll have enough for a way out of this place."
