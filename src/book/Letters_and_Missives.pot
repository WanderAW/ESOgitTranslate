msgid "Father,\n\nYou won't understand my reasons for leaving, but you deserve at least to hear them. Maybe you'll reread them eventually and they'll make sense.\n\nI am not a mage. My talents in magic, by your own contemptuous admission, are weak. My skills lie elsewhere, and I plan to put them to use. I will never be the prodigal mage you hoped for, but you have never heard me sneak in or out of the house, nor do you likely know that I overheard your comments to your wizard friends over dinner. I know you think little of me, and wish I had been born otherwise, but I have not, and I'll spare you the further burden of my company.\n\nI will send money home, a portion of that I make. Whether you find it proof that I am doing well for myself or simply find it useful to put food on your table matters not to me. Consider it slow repayment for the years you have dealt with the burden of an underachieving son.\n\nI love you dearly, Father, but I cannot abide your company. Live well.\n\nYour son,\n\nTamien"

Well, foreign mud.\n\nThe soldiers I'm with are a motley band. We Altmer are disciplined and respect the chain of command. But the Renrijra and the Oathbreakers are another story.\n\nThe Renrijra are Khajiiti privateers. They're very relaxed. No drilling, no inspections … but if you make one mad, she fights like one fierce bastard. They're good to spend some downtime with, as we did up the coast while we were waiting for the Bosmer. Don't worry, I didn't try any moon-sugar.\n\nEverybody always says the Oathbreakers are Bosmer barbarians. (Except for Captain Pamolwen. Privileges of rank, I guess.) They eat vegetables, carve wood, all of that. You'd think without primitive traditions, they'd be happy, but they're a grim bunch. They and the Khajiit avoid each other.\n\nI tried their meat alcohol, since we weren't allowed to bring any wine of our own. The ""rotmeth"" was nasty at first, but you get used to it.\n\nHow will we hold together when we actually land? These Argonians are civilians, but there'll be a lot of them. Shadowfen seems alien and dangerous. Some of the animals, you'd think came from Morrowind. Those who live with such creatures must be pretty tough.

msgid "This month's Tribunal Temple Profile shines a bright light on our own high priest in the service of Lord Vivec—Archcanon Tarvus! Yours truly, Seventy-sixth Adjuvant Drumara, sat down to interview the busy cleric in his well-appointed office in the Hall of Wisdom, in the canton directly across from Vivec's Palace in Vivec City.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: Thank you for agreeing to talk with me, Archcanon. The faithful who regularly read our weekly missives have been asking to learn more about the Dunmer who keeps the Temple and the city running smoothly.\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: Lord Vivec and the Tribunal keep the wheels turning. I am merely their servant.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: Modest, as always! How did you find your way to a life of religious service?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: I grew up in House Indoril, so while a role in the Temple wasn't guaranteed, it was certainly strongly encouraged. I found that the words of the Warrior-Poet moved me, and I quickly gravitated toward serving Lord Vivec. Here's a secret few people know—I almost dedicated myself to the Buoyant Armigers. The call to adventure appealed to my younger self, and I even fancied myself something of a poet. Lord Vivec, however, had other plans for me.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: So it's true that Lord Vivec himself recruited you into his priesthood?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: Let's not make the story more significant than the reality. I was a young acolyte, training for a life of service in the Temple. When the time came to choose a path, Lord Vivec talked to me and suggested I would do better in the priesthood than as a swashbuckling Armiger or a militaristic Ordinator. I meditated on my choice and discovered, deep in my heart, that I agreed with him.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: And then you demonstrated a real talent for both spiritual and administrative labors, rising to become the youngest canon ever to attain the rank of archcanon?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: Young? I suppose so. But that was so long ago. I worked hard, constantly demonstrating my devotion to Vivec, the Three, and the people of Morrowind. That Lord Vivec saw fit to reward me with this honor and this responsibility, well, you'd have to ask him why I of all the canons was ultimately selected to replace my predecessor. I am just grateful for the opportunity to help my Lord and serve my Temple.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: Your sermons on the dangers of outlanders in Vvardenfell can be quite stirring. Do you think our land really faces a threat from those who come with different cultures and beliefs?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: For a minor priest and functionary, you tend to ask leading questions. My views on outlanders, however, are quite well known and completely consistent. No one other than the Dark Elves can claim such a unique relationship as we have with our Living Gods. That gives us a perspective and outlook on life that is, in fact, superior to every other culture in Tamriel. We are stronger when we are pure, when our culture isn't polluted by the thoughts and ideas of the lesser peoples. But other than that, I have nothing against the occasional outlander visiting our fair and beautiful island of Vvardenfell. ""To challenge the strange allows us to know our strength,"" as the Warrior-Poet has written.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: One of your closest aides, Canon Llevule Andrano, has been quoted as saying that you ""carry the burden of Lord Vivec and the entire palace atop your shoulders."" Do you agree with his assessment?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: Is it a burden to serve the Warrior-Poet? Is it an obligation to make sure the business of the palace and the Temple and the city progresses smoothly and without stumble? I do what I do for my love of the Tribunal and its people. That is not a burden, Adjuvant Drumara, that is a rare and singular privilege! I do my best to instill that same attitude in all of the priests that serve under my administration. You would do well to remember that, as I am quite certain you fit into that category.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: Of course, Archcanon Tarvus. I simply asked so that I could quote you accurately. May I ask one more question before we conclude this interview?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: If you must.\n\nAdjuvant Drumara: How is the work on Vivec City coming along?\n\nArchcanon Tarvus: Construction on Lord Vivec's metropolis proceeds just as the Warrior-Poet has commanded. The cantons take shape like islands in the bay. The ziggurats rise as though to touch Baar Dau itself. It is already a masterpiece, and it is not yet nearly half done! Vivec City is already the envy of every other nation in Tamriel. Imagine the accolades we shall receive as it nears completion! Now, if we're done here, I have the business of Lord Vivec to get back to."

As the Dusk Lady often says, insight requires sacrifice.\n\nI took care to write down all the details of my visions. I pray this note will lead you to the other oracles. And to me.\n\nIn my first vision, I saw wide stone halls, hewn by Elven hands and lit by blue stones. Storm-beasts prowl these halls. There were witches also—wide-eyed and cackling. My research suggests this may be the ruin of Rubble Butte, in Bangkorai.\n\nIn my second vision, I felt a blast of cold air and heard the rattling of chains. A prison, patrolled by necromancers and their abominations. They toil in profane silence, excavating something. I believe this might be Faldar's Tooth, in the Rift.\n\nFinally, I saw a Daedric temple, adrift in a sea of lava and ash. I fear this prison waits for me. The abbey's books call it Mephala's Nest. You'll find it in Stonefalls.\n\nSeek out these dark places, retrieve the Void Keys hidden within, and use the Daedric Essence you collected to free us from Oblivion. We're counting on you.

Though accurate as to the function of said unit, in the local vernacular the title has been shortened to simply ""Thalmor,"" which inaccurately conflates our diplomatic corps with the Dominion military. Furthermore, inasmuch as the Fists, in pursuit of their enforcement duties, may occasionally exert more force than some might think necessary, this taints the Thalmor with a perception that our agents are heavy-handed thugs. Needless to say, this doesn't help when negotiating for aid from the local indigenes. \n\nIn future, I think we would be wise to return to referring to our enforcement units as ""Justiciars,"" even if it does make our Khajiiti citizens disinclined to join because it sounds so stuffy. \n\nYours in Diplomacy, \n\nCanonreeve Falduil"

Please read this privately, and I beg you to exercise discretion in discussing its contents with your advisors. \n\nOf utmost importance are matters related to security here in Alcaire, and unfortunately, though I have strong concerns, I do not have the convenience of a simple or even a consistent element to which I might ascribe Alcaire's troubles of late. \n\nAt the time of my last communication, there were only a few reports of these Vaermina cultists, the Supernal Dreamers. Our shared hopes of this being a short-lived problem were not realized. It seems the cultists have grown even bolder—raiding outlying farms and even recruiting citizens to join their mad ranks. The Knights of the Flame have orders to arrest cult members on sight, but we await further instruction from you on how to deal with a threat that has now spread to other regions of Stormhaven.\n\nThe Knights of the Flame continue to prove invaluable allies and staunch defenders of the realm. They have been instrumental in helping me address the cultist problem and in reacting to an attempt made on the duchess' life by an Alik'r assassin. The leader of the Knights of the Flame, one Sir Hughes, suggested that the order assume responsibility for security here at the castle, and I was relieved to agree. It has been a weight lifted off my shoulders. \n\nLastly, and most personally, I wish to express my most sincere gratitude for the arrangement of my marriage to Princess Lakana. Though I feared our union of political necessity would be formal and awkward, nothing could be further from the truth. Her warmth and kindness have created an intimacy between us that I never dreamt possible.  \n\nWe both owe you our gratitude and our undying loyalty.\n\nYours truly, \n\nNathaniel\n\nP.S.: The tricks these Redguard women employ in the bedchamber…!

I know how much you miss drinking out on the front lines, and believe me, the first few rounds are on me when you get back, but you can't possibly miss listening to some drunken idiot argue about politics.\n\nSo this Breton, he starts getting really loud, and he rants about all the reasons we're at war with the Aldmeri Dominion. He talks about economic factors, he talks about resources, he talks about crafting, the guy goes on for what seems like forever, and that's when he stops to take a drink. Which was long enough for me to say two words: ""You're wrong.""\n\nBecause this guy doesn't know a bloody thing about what it's like fighting the Dominion. Out on the battlefield, they don't care about economics or resources or religion. You're out there for one reason: to kill them before they kill you.\n\nEveryone else here knows the truth. For all their lofty Elven pretense, the Aldmeri Dominion only really cares about one thing: conquest. Though they do have standards—they only want to conquer the non-Elves. Like us.\n\nSo I told that drunken fool the same thing you told us. Without soldiers like us standing between them and the Imperial throne, the Elves will push and push and push until they hold everything from the shores of High Rock to the heart of Cyrodiil.\n\nAny Altmer who looks at a Breton, he's going to see a human. Any Altmer who looks at a Redguard like me … well, there's no way around it, he pretty much knows I'm a Redguard. And there's no mistaking an Orc. Ain't none of us Elves.\n\nLife is getting a little more relaxed in the city now, since everyone has pretty much accepted we're at war, and there's still the occasional High Elf in the streets who can go about his business without a fight. It's still sane enough that they can walk around in public. Inside the city walls, I've seen a handful of High Elves walking into the Mages Guild, selling their wares, and even ordering those fruity wines they like so much, and as long as the city watch is keeping the peace, we'll be peaceful.\n\nBut when we're in the field, we don't hesitate. Everyone—except that one loudmouthed Breton I put in his place—everyone knows we're holding the line against the Altmer. And when we come back to town in one piece, we're going to be heroes, and we'll be shouting and drinking in that tavern. \n\nSo make sure you come back in one piece.\n\nStay safe,\n\nDuqaq af-Wazif"

I really need to thank you for what you've done to my ship and crew.\n\nPleasant dreams.\n\n— Captain Lerisa"

msgid "Dearest Vigrod,\n\nWe were all thrilled to hear of your latest promotion! Your father still says you should have stayed on the farm, of course, but he's secretly proud to have a son in the Companions. Don't tell him I said so, though.\n\nThat sweet little Gurilda stopped by the house yesterday. She brought over some venison and a jug of Four-Eye Grog from her pa. She knows Dad has a sweet spot for the grog. And since he hurt his back and can't hunt, the venison is very welcome.\n\nThat girl's going to make someone a good hearth-wife someday soon. Could be you, if you came out of your shell a bit and actually talked to her. Pretty face, good hips, a fine farm to inherit, quite a catch all told. But no more about that.\n\nNow don't you worry about us, we'll be fine. Pa can't work the farm like he used to, but we're talking about hiring a hand or two to help out. With all the refugees streaming past here day and night, help is easy to find.\n\nPlease try not to get stabbed or slashed any more. You weren't the handsomest of lads to start with. A few scars build character but too many will ruin what looks you have. \n\nAll my love,\n\nMother"
