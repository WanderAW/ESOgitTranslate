msgid "By Querbolus Primus\n\nWhen first I was taken by the Change I was terrified, and furious, and most of all terrified of my fury. I hid my transformed self in a woodshed where I tore the bark from the lumber, bewailed my fate, and cursed the rest of the world. \n\nFor a season thereafter I sought a means to control my affliction, purchasing ill-smelling nostrums from alchemists, mystic talismans from arcanists, and blessings from priests of gods, demigods, even daemons. To no avail. Despite all my would-be benefactors' assurances, the Change still came upon me when it would—and seemed, indeed, stronger every time. \n\nFinally it was too strong: I killed, and killed again. Unworthy to abide among decent people, I fled, putting civilization behind me. I plunged into the forests, forded rivers and climbed mountains, until I was far from any innocents I might injure. There, with naught but brute beasts for companions, I gave in to the urge to hunt, and to slay, and to feed. \n\nBut I found to my sorrow that, though the beasts had neither minds nor souls, still they had hearts. They felt fear, pain, loss, sadness, and to slaughter them out of hand was no less a sin than to slaughter Man or Mer. \n\nThereafter I lived upon nuts, fruits, buds, roots, and animals freshly dead. And this I could easily do for, when the Change was upon me, my senses were so acute that I could always detect food of all sorts. \n\nMore than that: with my hunger assuaged, I found that when in beast-form I could see things, hear things, smell things I was never aware of when in my ""natural"" body. I could sense every living creature in the mountain hollow where I'd made my home, hear every sound they made blend with the songs of the flowing streams and the music of the wind in the trees, until all combined into a glorious and never-ending choral symphony. I would stand in a glade, enraptured, intoxicated, sometimes for days at a time. \n\nWhen I returned to my ordinary mortal form, I would try to write of what I had experienced as a Beast of Mundus, but human words could never capture it. It could only be shared by others who could sense what I sensed, who might learn how to tame the lusts of the Change as I had. And I knew then that I had a sacred mission to share what I had found, to find others who had been stricken by this curse and bring them to my hollow, where I could teach them the truth, that their curse was, in fact, their glory. This change we fear so much at first is not an affliction, but a gift. \n\nThis sacred mission has been my purpose ever since, a purpose I hope someday to see passed on to future generations. Here, right here, in my little vale of Querbol's Hollow."

msgid "By Lady Cinnabar of Taneth\n\nIt's not uncommon for scholars to note the clear similarities between the gods Xarxes, Arkay, and Tu'whacca. (For a particularly uninspired summary of the obvious, see ""Psychopomps of Tamriel"" by that old bloviator Phrastus of Elinhir.) Nearly every culture on the continent worships these deities in one form or another—indeed, the Wood Elves of Valenwood revere them both! I wish, in this brief disquisition, to pose several questions about the origins of these gods, and then speculate upon the answers to those questions.\n\nWe begin with Xarxes, as his worship, at least as recorded in written history, predates that of both Arkay and Tu'whacca. An Elven deity who records the life-stories of all the races of Aldmeri, Xarxes appears in multiple creation or origin stories, many of which are inconsistent with each other. While some of these origins may be ""false,"" their multiplicity may also merely be a reflection of Xarxes' many-fold nature. \n\nIn the two most common origin myths, Xarxes appears either as Auri-El's scribe, recording events at his side since the beginning of time, or as a Merethic Aldmeri priest of Auri-El who was elevated to divinity by the higher deity. The latter story is consistent with the High Elves' conceit that they are directly descended from the Aedra, and can, in certain miraculous circumstances, apotheosize and re-ascend to godly status. \n\nFor the Altmer, Xarxes records not just the life stories of individual Elves, but all the connections of lineage and heritance that bind them together and link them to their ancestors. As nothing is more important to an Altmer than his or her ancestry, it is easy to understand Xarxes' paramount role in defining and maintaining status and stability in Summerset society.\n\nArkay, of course, is one of the Eight Divines that were presented to the newly-freed citizens of Cyrodiil by St. Alessia at the founding of the First Empire. Though official dogma of the Church of the Eight holds that Alessia was merely revealing to her subjects gods who had been watching over them all along, scholarly research of documentary fragments that survive from early in the First Era hint at a different story. Khosey's ""Tamrilean Tractates,"" are well known, but I have also had the privilege of studying Sandralath's ""Nedic Oblations"" and the anonymous ""Death-Song for King Darodiil"" in their original manuscripts. Comparisons of the latter two against each other illuminated several previously obscure passages in both, and the resulting clarification was the impetus for this paper. \n\nTo come to the point, I believe I may well finally have enough evidence to confirm Sedulus' speculative ""Theory of Arkayn Convergence."" Most of my readers will doubtless be familiar with Sedulus' proposal that the Arkay of the Eight Divines is, in origin, a fusion of aspects of the Elven deity Xarxes with those of the primal Atmoran death-god Orkey. My new translation of the Death-Song and its (formerly ill-understood) ""plea for soul-guidance"" passages make it clear that the psychopomp being addressed possesses attributes of both the Elven and Atmoran deities. And, once the proper vowel-shift is applied, what is the name of this god? \n\n""To-Arcka.""\n\nWhich brings us, inevitably, to the Yokudan deity Tu'whacca. How long he was worshiped in that name by the human tribes of Yokuda is now unknowable, as all our race's records were lost in the cataclysm that sank the archipelago. But as even old Phrastus had the wits to note, it cannot be a coincidence that Tu'whacca performs the same functions for the Redguards that Arkay and Xarxes do for Tamrielic Men and Mer. Are these gods really separate and distinct deities, or are they all aspects of the same deity, worshiped under different names in different cultures? \n\nYou must seek the answer elsewhere, for that is where scholarship ends and theology begins."

I was beside myself, quivering, and he believed I was afraid.\n\nHe was mistaken. It was rage that overtook me, not fear, and as I stepped off the last stair, their swords still to my back, I spun around and released that rage.\n\nVolraine died almost instantly, engulfed in a cloud of flame, his scream muted by the roar of my destruction spell. As the next guard leapt over Volraine's burning remains, I turned his sword away with a bolt of lightning to the throat, and the weapon slid neatly into the chest of a third guard. It stunned me how warm the blood was. Suddenly my hands were covered in it, and I marveled at the balmy fluid. It was like wearing the finest velvet gloves in the land, and it amused me to no end. For the first time since my capture, I laughed. I roared.\n\nEventually, they sent another contingent of guards to search for the first.

Provided you complete the required reading prior to each session, you will acquire a clear understanding of these mythogenic forces that will serve as a sufficient base for deeper study in a number of disciplines, from historical inquiry to theoretical aetheroplanar manipulation.\n\nYour cultural and personal preconceptions will be challenged. Common myths will be dispelled, from crude misinterpretations of the Aedra as powerful creator-beings of ""good"" looking down upon and tinkering with Nirn to the supposition of Aedra and Daedra as locked in perpetual extra-Mundic war. The explorations presented in this course have, in the past, offended certain dogmatic students (especially in regards to the Divines), but I urge you to approach these topics as a scholar and not as a priest.\n\nUnderstanding the Aedra beyond creation mythology and the convention of the Divines will allow you to grow as a scholar. The very approach this series demands will instruct you in the proper methodology of scholarly pursuits: we will study rare and obscure texts, unravel complex symbolic structures, and approach each topic from a critical standpoint.\n\nThe five primary lecture topics are as follows:\n\nLecture One: Survey of Origination Myths\n\nLecture Two: Anuic-Padomaic Interplay\n\nLecture Three: Aedra v. Daedra\n\nLecture Four: Aedric Energies and Influence\n\nLecture Five: Beyond Mere Divines\n\nOutside reading and sedulous note-taking are necessary for full understanding of the lectures. All required outside texts referenced can be found in the fine library on the grounds. Do not wait to the last possible moment to prepare for a lecture; only a few copies of certain ancient and obscure texts will be available.\n\nNaturally, you will be inclined to explore some of the subjects presented further. Your newfound knowledge of Aedric beings, their involvement in creation, a broader understanding of their relationship to the Eight Divines, and exposure to current debates will propel you to additional studies. For additional reading, I recommend works by Brother Hetchfeld, Brother Mikhael Karkuxor, and Aicantar of Shimmerene (beyond those we will reference through the series). Be ever vigilant in your studies, however, and avoid clearly biased or poorly-researched works, such as those scribbled by Cinnabar of Taneth. Always seek refutations and take no one scholar's words for absolute truth."

It was here that she discovered the Gray Menhir.\n\nThe stone loomed over Ranev, dwarfing her and casting a long shadow over the land and water. Ranev was greatly impressed by the size of the standing stone, for she was known for her strength and great height. To her amazement, she watched as words were carved into the stone, struck with great precision by unknown, invisible hands to create a tablet of sorts. The tablet exhorted her with the following words: \n\n""Heed the Stars, O pilgrim, and undertake their quest. Seek their six virtues, hewn into stone. Bear each command with a noble heart and return with the utmost speed. For only the swift and the just shall receive celestial favor.""\n\nReading these words, Ranev's chest swelled with great purpose. She resolved to take up the stone's challenge and seek the virtues of the Stars. She meditated in front of the Gray Menhir and sang a warrior's hymn before setting out to complete her pilgrimage.\n\nRanev traveled swiftly, visiting each of the six holy sites in turn. At each site, the warrior had to overcome dangerous creatures, foul beasts, and other challenges to find the prayer markers and receive the six virtues. She returned to the Gray Menhir within the allotted time, victorious, with the virtues of the Stars singing inside her. She pledged to embody the virtues until the end of her days. From that point on, Ranev the Coal-Eyed Wanderer became known as Ranev the Favored of the Stars.\n\nAnd her adventures were just beginning."

msgid "by Faustillus Junius\nSubcurator of Ancient Theology and Paleonumerology\nImperial Library\n\nThe position Shezarr enjoys in Cyrodilic worship if often misconstrued. He, and a thousand other deities, have sizeable cults in the Imperial City. Shezarr is especially venerated in the Colovian West, though he is called Shor there, as the West Kings are resolutely, and religiously, Nordic.\n\nThe haziness of Shezarr's relationship to the Divines (he is often called their ""Missing Sibling"") begins with St. Alessia, the so-called ""Slave Queen of Cyrodiil,"" the founder figure of the original Cyrodilic Empire. In the earliest Cyro-Nordic stories of the Heartland, Shezarr fought against the Ayleids (the ""Heartland High Elves"") on mankind's behalf. Then, for some unknown reason, he vanishes from the stage (presumably to help other humans elsewhere), and, without his leadership, the Ayleids conquer the humans and enslave them.\n\nThis slavery lasts for generations. The isolated humans eventually begin to venerate the pantheon of their masters, or at least assimilate so much of High Elven religious practices into their native traditions that the two become indistinguishable.\n\nIn 1E 242, under the leadership of Alessia, her demigod lover, Morihaus-Breath-of-Kyne, and the infamous Pelinal Whitestrake, the Cyrodilic humans revolt. When Skyrim lends its armies to the Slave-Queen of the South, the revolution succeeds. The Ayleid Hegemonies are quickly overthrown. Shortly thereafter, White-Gold Tower is captured by Alessia's forces, and she promptly declares herself the first Empress of Cyrodiil. Part of the package meant that she had to become the High Priestess of Akatosh, as well.\n\nAkatosh was an Aldmeri god, and Alessia's subjects were as-yet unwilling to renounce their worship of the Elven pantheon. She found herself in a very sensitive political situation. She needed to keep the Nords as her allies, but they were (at that time) fiercely opposed to any adoration of Elven deities. On the other hand, she could not force her subjects to revert back to the Nordic pantheon, for fear of another revolution. Therefore, concessions were made and Empress Alessia instituted a new religion: the Eight Divines, an elegant, well-researched synthesis of both pantheons, Nordic and Aldmeri.\n\nShezarr, as a result, had to change. He could no longer be the bloodthirsty anti-Aldmer warlord of old. He could not disappear altogether either, or the Nords would have withdrawn their support of her rule. In the end, he had become ""the spirit behind all human undertaking."" Even though this was merely a thinly-disguised, watered-down version of Shor, it was good enough for the Nords."

I plan to document the noteworthy incidents of my travels so I have them for the book I'm going to write when I retire from adventuring.\n\nDay 7\nI had to defend myself from a bandit attack on the road today. I guess they didn't expect me to be more proficient with a blade than they were, but fortunately my training paid off. I dispatched one, and the other two fled, wounded. I did not relish the act, and while I realize that it was either him or me, I hope I do not have cause to do so again in the future. Now it's time to get past this unpleasant incident and focus on building my legend!\n\nDay 15\nI helped rescue a family's cow from a burning barn today! I got a little singed, but they gave me a jug of fresh milk, a block of cheese, and told me to stop by whenever I passed through this area. My renown is growing, and I look forward to more adventures in the days to come. \n\nDay 22\nI've already encountered some strange things in my travels but without question the most disturbing so far was watching that man take his own life just outside the town of Goldfolly. He was sobbing and incoherent, and there was nothing I could do as he brought the knife across his wrists. At first I was reluctant to go through his belongings, but my rumbling stomach overrode my misgivings. It looked like he was just setting off on a trip, as his provisions were fully packed and unused. I briefly considered bringing the body back to town, but they would just as likely condemn me for dragging a corpse into their midst as thank me for returning him. I couldn't just leave him to rot though, so I left a letter under the door of the Inn and watched from a nearby hill as he was buried the next day. \n\nOn a related note, I believe I've acquired my first magical item from this unfortunate fellow. I'm not sure what this amulet is supposed to do exactly, but the way it glows tells me that it must hold some type of power. I believe it will help me in my future endeavors. Soon enough, I'll be in full enchanted armor with a blazing sword!\n\nDay 24\nHaving trouble sleeping. I believe this wooded area must be haunted as I keep hearing voices. I'm sure my spirits will improve when I emerge from this shrouded forest. \n\nDay 26\nI haven't slept in days. The voices have gotten louder and more persistent every day, even after I left the woods. I am haunted by the death I caused and the death I did not prevent. I have tried to bury the amulet in the forest, but I cannot bring myself to leave it. \n\nDay 30\nI am a monster and I don't deserve to live."

If you ever again confuse the Hlaalu and Dres merchant nobles with whom we trade, I will disown you three and ten times, and once again to make the deed final and eternal.\n\n(the fact that a primer of this sort is required at all indicates lapses in Temple indoctrination curricula—must delegate a canon to investigate and propose reforms)\n\nHouse Redoran: ""A Redoran is a warrior whose duty is first to the Tribunal, second to House Redoran, and third to family and clan.""\n\n-	Saint Nerevar the Captain is the patron saint of House Redoran. \n\n(re-check Temple texts about death of Nerevar—can't be too careful on that)\n\nHouse Indoril: ""Justice knows no sleep: Indoril shall order, the Temple shall judge.""\n\n-	Saint Olms the Just is the patron saint of House Indoril. \n\nHouse Hlaalu: ""To trade fairly and freely is to honor the Three.""\n\n-	Saint Veloth the Pilgrim is the patron saint of House Hlaalu. \n\nHouse Dres: ""To spread culture and truth to the benighted: this is our commitment and burden.""\n\n-	Saint Llothis the Pious is the patron saint of House Dres. \n\n(must point this out to Vivec; it will tickle his sense of irony)\n\nHouse Telvanni: ""The forceful expression of will gives true honor to the Ancestors.""\n\n-	Saint Vorys the Immolant is the patron saint of House Telvanni. \n\nYou will likely not note the lack of an ascribed motto to the sixth house, the shadow house, house Dagoth.

If you ever mention this house in polite company, I will disown you. \n\nYou will note that twice, now, I have threatened to disown you. This is because my hands are not so black as Mephala's or Lord Vivec's.

So one day Boethiah, Prince of Plots, precocious youth, tricked Trinimac to go into his mouth. Boethiah talked like Trinimac for awhile then, and gathered enough people to listen to him. Boethiah showed them the lies of the et'Ada, the Aedra, and told them Trinimac was the biggest liar of all, saying all this with Trinimac's voice! Boethiah told the mass before him the Tri-Angled Truth. He showed them, with Mephala, the rules of Psijic Endeavor. He taught them how to build Houses, and what items they needed to bury in the Corners. He demonstrated the right way to wear their skin. He performed the way to walk to achieve an Exodus. Then Boethiah relieved himself of Trinimac right there on the ground before them to prove all the things he said were the truth. It was easy then for his new people to become the Changed Ones."

msgid "2nd of Rain's Hand\nThe Eight have spoken to me! Me, of all the Mer in the Summerset Isles. They chose me. My mother always said I was destined for greatness. A crow appeared to me in a dream. Asked me to spread the word that the end is coming. The end is coming and we must prepare if we wish to bask in the light of Auri-El.\n\n- - -\n8th of Rain's Hand\nI've begun my mission. Already a small group of followers have gathered around me. Including my own brother, Quaronaldil! We must spread the word before our time runs out. I've sent Quaronaldil to start in Alinor, another in Cloudrest. I'll make the journey to Auridon. Focus on the people of Skywatch. I need to start making the necessary arrangements.\n\n- - -\n20th of Rain's Hand\nI've finally arrived in Skywatch and begun spreading the word. Many appear doubtful, but a few have seen the truth. We're working hard to save the souls of our brethren. I've been praying to the Divines to send me another sign. Something I can use to add fire to the words I preach and show the truth behind them. \n\n- - -\n15th of Second Seed\nIt's finally happened. The crow appeared again. The Divines have given me the date when it will happen. It will be the 10th of Sun's Height. I have a mere two months to get the people of Tamriel to see the light. I must get the word to the others throughout the Isles before time runs out.\n\n- - -\n30th of Second Seed\nAnother dream! This time the crow bore a message. The Divines have declared that if I can sacrifice an Altmer of noble blood, it will prevent the end from arriving. I have one such Altmer within my flock. If I cannot persuade him to be a willing sacrifice, we may need to take more desperate measures. Either way, it must be done to secure the lives of all living things.\n\n- - -\n5th of Mid Year\nI've summoned all of our followers for the ceremony. It will take place in the town of Ezduiin. Many of the faithful tend the fires there. The noble will die. And so many will live.\n\n- - -\n10th of Mid Year\nSomeone has warned the nobleman. He sent along his apologies. He will not attend. I must take more direct action. I've sent my most loyal of followers to Skywatch. Their blades will save us all.\n\n- - -\n14th of Mid Year\nThe ceremony was a success! My flock has fulfilled its purpose. But I fear I now know who has betrayed me. My own brother, Quaronaldil, has not been seen with the flock for many days. I fear the worst. \n\n- - -\n19th of Mid Year\nThe Skywatch Guard assaults Ezduiin! Quaronaldil, no doubt, is responsible. They have us trapped in the undercroft of Ezduiin. I refuse to allow my followers to die at the hands of infidel guards.\n\n- - -\n21st of Mid Year\nThe Crow came to me again in a dream. It told me to use the Mallari-Mora. I must secure the innocence of the faithful. The blades of the non-believers will not drink of my flock. Although our mortal lives here will be at an end, the crow has promised our souls will be delivered to Auri-El himself."

When blessed darkness falls and the moons fill the sky, the time to celebrate is nigh!\n\nHave you prepared your plunder skulls? Filled them with ghoulish riches to inspire both horror and greed among the uninitiated? And have you distributed them to the most powerful and fearsome villains across the land? Good, good. Then all is in readiness for the celebration to come!\n\nWith every plunder skull earned during the time of the festival, the power and vitality of the witch covens grow. So what if villains fall and the adventuring masses acquire the prizes we sequestered in our macabre, skull-shaped baskets? The chaos sowed as they strive to find and collect them all adds an undeniable sweetness to the power we attain. \n\nRemember, O faithful, that the deadliest foes of the world drop plunder skulls upon defeat. Adventurers simply have to slay such a foe to acquire its plunder skull. And they may acquire as many as they are able during the allotted time, as long as they continue to triumph over these foes.\n\nEvery plunder skull contains a useful and creepy treasure, provided you prepared your plunder skulls correctly. Remember, you can fill them with Alchemy Materials, Provisioning Recipes, Fishing Bait, Furniture … anything, as long as it inspires greed and makes those not of the covens uneasy.\n\nSome of you have asked about the more rare and powerful Dremora plunder skulls. Know this, O faithful: If you must ask, you are not skilled or proficient enough to create such a vessel. These vessels contain a specific set of Dremora Motif chapters, and have been distributed to the superior defenders of such extreme locations as the Dragonstar and Maelstrom Arenas, the Dark Anchors and Abyssal Geysers, Delves and Dungeons, and Trials. They can also be acquired by defeating the most deadly of champions wandering the wilderness of Tamriel, as well as the lords of deadly subterranean domains. \n\nNow go, O faithful, and celebrate!

msgid "By Morian Zenas\n\nThe Seekers pretend that they cannot talk, but they can. For I have heard them. They can both understand speech, and utter it, though they do so with a hissing lisp. I shall tell you how I know. \n\nAs is so often the case since I came to Apocrypha, I was cowering behind a stack of books, hiding from the baleful attentions of a towering gill-man whose notice I had inadvertently caught. I listened to hear if I was still gibbering, but I couldn't hear it, which usually means I'm not. Then I heard something else. \n\nJust beyond my concealing tower of tomes was one of those endless halls lined with numberless urns, halls that I have assiduously avoided ever since I learned that each urn houses, in a broth of noisome fluid, a living concept-organ excised from its corpus. I do not like those urns. \n\nFrom the entrance to this hall of urns came the all-too-familiar squelching sound of a Seeker's footfalls. But then it stopped, and in its place I heard, for the first time, the sticky sound of a speaking Seeker.\n\n—I know a thing, the Seeker lisped, as a frisson of horror danced down my spine. \n\n—Is it a thing worth knowing? came the hollow, sourceless voice of the organ in the hithermost urn. \n\n—You shall judge, Floater. I have learned why we have seen no mortal intruders, save for the demented wizard, in many turns of the Great Pages. \n\n—You know nothing, said the organ. \n\n—I know Old Antecedent has entered into an agreement with the mortals, a compact, as they say. Is that nothing? asked the Seeker.\n\n—Next to nothing. The Golden Eye is always entering into pacts with mortals. Thus my woeful condition. \n\n—Avoid self-pity, or I shall mock you. You do not like it when I mock you. Listen attentively.\n\n—I listen.\n\n—In truth, the Scryer enters into many pacts with mortals—but never before has he made a pact with every mortal on Nirn. \n\n—Bah. Unlikely. \n\n—I state it! It is a thing that is known. \n\n—How? \n\n—I heard a discussion between Scrivener Uu-Thorax and the Eleventh Preceptor. They came into the Crepuscule, where I was quietly….\n\n—Seeking?\n\n—Yes. In fact. Now, listen: the Scrivener told the Preceptor that the Inevitable Knower had agreed to a pact, to cease all direct interposition in Mundial affairs. \n\n—Impossible. I scoff. Mock me as you will. \n\n—So thought I, and likewise the Preceptor expressed skepticism, but then the Scrivener spoke a Word of Asseveration. Books scattered everywhere, ichor fountained from my ear-holes, and I knew what he said was a Known Thing. \n\n—But why? To meddle with mortals and wrest from them their knowledge is the Ur-Daedra's favorite pastime. \n\n—He seems to have been paid a great price, something he dearly desired, but I could not clearly hear what, due to the injury to my ear-holes. \n\n—It is knowledge, of course. Some great secret. It is ever so. \n\n—So I deem it as well. And it seems this compact binds in both directions, which is why the mortals come here no more, added the Seeker.\n\n—Except for the mad mage. How came he here, and upon what ill errand? asked the urn-organ.\n\n—I know not. But if we catch him, we will pull out his … what is that sound?\n\nI heard it too, and so I ran. For I knew that sound. It was gibbering."

Arrows rend Kynareth's holy gales, and all the Divines sadly shake their heads as their Commands are stifled by the drums of war. Oh faithful, the heretics surrounding us on all sides seek to propagate their blasphemies and lies, to trample on the legacy of Reman and spit upon the Divines themselves, endeavoring to bury them forever or obscure them behind a veil of lies.\n\nWe true servants of the Divines know these profane foes, these misguided alliances, cannot and shall not prevail. Akatosh, invincible and eternal, will not forsake us if only we show our devotion, if only we stand up when so many have been beaten down before us, if only we cry out against the flood of pretenders and their cruel masters. We are called now, brothers and sisters, to silence the dissenters and Daedric thralls that surround us. We are roused by Akatosh's mighty roar and must not stand by as the Golden Hill shakes in resonating rage.\n\nThough we wear only simple robes, Stendarr defends us. He envelops us in light, in unbreakable Aedric glory. He turns aside the blades of the heretics and proclaims our eternal victory. Though we wield only our words, Julianos sharpens them to a razor edge. He forges our very minds into weapons, fills us with holy words to awaken the faithful. Though we may feel weak and afraid, Akatosh's mighty voice commands us forward, and we know that we will be conquering heroes, that we will set the Empire right by his command. \n\nTo restore our beloved Empire, we must not falter or be shaken; we must not cower before the armies that ravage our home. Now is the time to honor our pact, consecrated by His mighty blood. We are not abandoned; no, we have been granted a sacred moment in which to prove our unwavering devotion, to stand against the tides of evil that erode our shores. Take up your implements of war. The Divines are your shield, your shining armor, your immaculate blade. They will carry us forth to drive the enemy out and restore rightful peace and order to Tamriel.\n\nDo not hesitate, for you must surely hear this call, echoing loud and true within your spirit.

msgid "By Bereditte Jastal\n\nDeath. It is something we all face. Or do we?\n \nJust ask the nearest Nord what he thinks of the end of life, and you'll likely be treated to a horrific story of blood, bone and viscera, of courageous deeds and heartbreaking sorrow. Carnage notwithstanding, there may be even more to death than the average Nord warrior realizes. New evidence suggests a life beyond the battlefield, where a valiant Nord may live forever, downing mead and engaging in contests of strength and skill. But in order to fully understand the possibility of a Nord's eternal life after death, one must first reexamine the legends surrounding that most wondrous of warrior's retreats—Sovngarde.\n \nAccording to the ancient writings and oral traditions of the Nords, going back as far as the Late Merethic Era, there exists a place so magnificent, so honored, that the entrance lies hidden from view. Sovngarde, it is called, built by the god Shor to honor those Nords who have proven their mettle in war. Within this ""Hall of Valor"" time as we know it has no meaning. The concepts of life and death are left on the doorstep, and those within exist in a sort of self-contained euphoria, free of pain, suffering and the worst malady a Nord could suffer—boredom.\n \nBut just how well hidden the entrance to Sovngarde is has been a matter of much scholarly debate, and there are those who believe Shor's great hall is just a myth, for there are no actual accounts from Nords who have experienced the wonders of Sovngarde then returned to tell the tale. Not that this has stopped anyone from looking. Some Nords spend a lifetime searching for the mysterious hidden entrance to Sovngarde. Most return home sad and broken, their hearts heavy with failure. They'll never know the pleasure of a mead flagon that never empties, or a wrestling tournament without end.\n \nWhat, some may ask, does the entrance to Sovngarde have to do with death? Everything, according to a series of ancient parchments recently discovered in the attic of a deceased Nord's home in Cyrodiil. What at first seemed to be a series of love letters was later found to be a correspondence between one Felga Four-Fingers, a medium of some note, and the ghost of a Nord warrior named Rolf the Large. According to the parchments, Rolf had spent his entire life searching for the entrance to Sovngarde, without success. He was returning home to his village in Skyrim when he was waylaid by a band of giants. Rolf fought bravely, but was quickly killed, and the giants proceeded to play catch with his head. Amazingly, all of this was seen by Rolf in ghostly form as he drifted away from the scene, soaring upwards into the heavens, where he finally arrived … in the magnificent hall of Sovngarde!\n \nRolf could not believe his good fortune, and his foolishness for not having realized the truth so many years before. For death was the entrance to Sovngarde. So he was told by Shor himself, who greeted Rolf the Large as a brother, and personally handed him a leg of roast mutton and the hand of a comely wench. Sovngarde, Shor told him, can be entered by any Nord who dies valiantly in honorable combat.\n \nIt is time for Nords to learn the truth. Eternal life can be theirs, without the need to spend an entire mortal life in vain pursuit of something completely unattainable. In the end, all valiant Nords can enter Sovngarde. Dismemberment, decapitation or evisceration seems a small price to pay for the chance to spend an eternity in Shor's wondrous hall."

The Silo Theorem!\n\nSome of the grains in the Silo so far are fascinating to say the least. All wrong, of course, but it'll be well worth the collecting when I can return to Elden Root and sort through the chaff. More grist for the mill and I'll be able to refine the grains, grinding them into the flour of knowledge. I will bake the Loaf of Truth fully—no half-baked theories for me!\n\nWhere was I?\n\nAh, yes … the Falinesti Faithful's Collective, Grainy Truths and Non-Truths Include:\n\nThe Daedric Interference Conjecture: Falinesti was spirited away by a Daedric Prince or collection of forces (Clavicus Vile leads the voting almost two-to-one over Sheogorath).\n\nThe Magicka Transposition Formulation: A magical attack or accident transported the Walking City to the bottom of the sea (the Swimming City?).\n\nThe Lunar Backlash Premise: The Walking City is actually from one of the two moons (which one is hotly debated) and it is now walking back to (or on) one of the moons.\n\nThe Chicken Nonconformity Detonation: A surprisingly popular theory, I could not find out any agreed-upon details. Will investigate  further in the library at Elden Root.\n\nWayward Metropolist Doctrine: The Walking City got lost on its last trip.\n\nThe Celestial Purloinance Postulation: Stolen by the thief-god Rajhin for some unknown reason.\n\nThe Temporal Reversal Supposition: The Walking City has begun traveling backward in time.\n\nThe Temporal Leap Corollary: Falinesti has sprung forward in time and will be there for us to find it at some future date.\n\nThe Accelerated Invisibility Theory: Falinesti is still here, but moving so quickly between the sites we can't perceive it.\n\nThe Shared Urbanity Theorem: All cities are Falinesti, as it was and as it always will be.\n\n…Where's that ink gotten to?"

msgid "by Norgic Darkcloak\n\nThey call me insane! That's because they're short-sighted and afraid to grasp true power when it is offered freely. In the depths of the earth, beneath the simple structures of our village, I discovered a place of power and knowledge. It's a place where spirits whisper, waiting for someone to hear them.\n\nI heard their call. I listened to their holy words over and over and over again. ""You are what you eat,"" they whispered to me. ""You are what you eat, you are what you eat, you are what you eat."" \n\nThey never stopped. They never gave me a moment to clear my head. It was enough to drive me ins—\n\nNo, not that word. Never that word. I am not a madman!\n\nAfter they prepared me and opened my mind, the spirits taught me a ritual. A recipe, if you like. It's a way to take the power and strength of my enemies and make them my own. But why settle for the mortal power of Nords when there are so many better choices available?\n\nDaedra flesh was my first thought, but capturing and killing such a creature proved more difficult than I imagined. First, there aren't many Daedra wandering around the village, just waiting to jump into my soup pot. \n\nSo I looked around, and then I saw it. A solitary creature was roaming the plains beyond the village. A giant! What better meal could grant power and glory? What would be better than the succulent flesh of a giant?\n\nThe spirits tell me that the flesh is most potent when consumed raw, right off the bone. There are words to say and ceremonial gestures to make, preparing me for the transfer of power. When this power infuses me, nothing can stop me! Not even death. As long as my head remains attached to my body, I shall return!\n\nHere is what the spirits taught me. Here is the secret to becoming what you eat. Here is the chant:\n\nTYO UAR EWHA TYO UEA TYO UAR EWHA TYO UEA TYO UAR EWHA TYO UEA"

He ate little, his efforts concentrated upon renewing the ancient connection between the Hist and its people.\n\nOne morning, his wife insisted he eat a full meal. ""No matter how much you wish it, you cannot feast upon the Hist itself,"" she gently chided.\n\nJaraleet blinked as her words pierced his thinking. ""Hist sap!"" he cried, touching his forehead to hers with affection.\n\nThough no alchemist, Jaraleet concocted formula after formula. He distilled various ichors, combining each one in varying amounts with Hist sap, tasting them all, making adjustments. He felt the Hist urge him on, demanding he break through its silence.\n\nFinally, Jaraleet drank his master decoction. He savored the thick, sweet syrup coating his tongue. Standing quietly beneath the Hist's outstretched boughs, his eyes glittered with comprehension.\n\n""I am your child and servant,"" he whispered. And the Hist showed him all things."

msgid "By Cirantille \n\nStride through any Khajiiti settlement, whether a ramshackle northern encampment or an austere southern town, and you will notice the Two-Moons Temple—always the most expansive structure. Built to last and utilizing the finest local materials, this place of worship is central to Khajiiti society. Although the Cat-Man deems the Divines as preeminent (and their sanctuary offers prayers to bastardizations of our own Eight), they believe the Lunar Lattice—or the movement of Masser and Secunda—influences all matters of luck, destiny, and happenstance, a belief Venustinius Perquitienus has termed a ""hybrid heresy.""\n\nKhajiiti dogma reveres the moons as divine, furnishing life into the bodies of the Cat-Man by ingestion of moon-sugar, a sacred ingredient that can also be refined into a hallucinatory contraband. Although used for both culinary and ritualistic purposes, it can be easily distilled to form skooma, a wretched and illegal narcotic. Such wanton delirium seems to be kept in check by a hierarchy of Moon-Bishops who regulate these ingestions, which play a small part in Khajiiti ceremonies. The clergy mainly concerns itself with conducting services, rounding up fallen followers, and ruling on theological matters. If an impasse is reached, the issue is resolved by the Mane himself.\n\nThe absolute rulers of the Lunar Lattice, Manes are the most powerful of the Khajiit outside the clan-chiefs and king of Elsweyr. They may be a key official to bribe, corrupt, or remove should forthcoming hostilities occur to our southern border. Of further interest is the succession ritual for the Mane; when one expires, a sacred ritual determines his successor. A Moon Herald is appointed to shepherd the potential aspirants on what Khajiiti text describes as an epic and dangerous quest to the surface of the Two Moons themselves, with the sole returning candidate declared the new Mane. \n\nThe assumption that the lay Cat travels astrally to our moons is preposterous; Venustinius Perquitienus has termed it ""nauseous balderdash,"" and rightly so."

Every child and every elder stand with him, yet he stands alone.\n\nHer hunter's gaze meets his. She sees herself beside him, too. She blushes, and so does he. ""My Silvenar,"" she says at last. ""My Green Lady,"" he responds in turn. She lowers her claw and turns to the quarry.\n\n""In stalking these woods, in keeping them free of terrors, I lose myself to the Green."" She helps the quarry to its feet.\n\n""But I will always bring her back,"" says the Silvenar. ""You have nothing to fear from us, child of the forest. So long as there is the Green, we walk where you walk.""\n\nThe Silvenar vanishes among vines. The Green Lady leaps for the boughs. She watches the Bosmer trudge out of the stream and continue through the forest.\n\nBut she smiles, for the Bosmer is no longer afraid."

msgid "by Cirantille\n\nThe Wood Elf priests of Jephre, or ""Y'ffre,"" are known as spinners. They refer to Jephre as ""the Storyteller"" and believe he taught them how to live and behave through stories and metaphors.\n\nAs his priests, spinners emulate Y'ffre by preserving Bosmeri history, culture, and even laws through stories and metaphors. Elder spinners often speak entirely in metaphors, which makes them difficult to understand, even by other Bosmer. Some believe the spinners go insane as they age and this strange way of speech is merely a symptom of that madness.\n\nDo not be deceived! Spinners have magical powers, or at least keen insights. They tell stories not only of the past, but of the future, and their oft-confusing tales speak of upcoming events with remarkable, though often baffling, accuracy.\n\nOne more note: despite the popular belief that spinners only move when carried, the priests of Y'ffre can walk on their own. While they seldom travel far from their homes, some do so when the need arises. It is likely that other Wood Elves, fearing the loss of their spinners, spread the rumor that they cannot travel on their own to discourage such risky expeditions."

msgid "…not into the world, nor out of it, but between worlds they linger, held to the hearth and tomb by blood and loyalty. And if they come unbidden, from love of kin or faith to duty, it is not unholy. It is but the answering of the ancestors, the awakening of those who never sleep, the summoning to service of those bound through Hearth and House to the protection of the clan.\n\nBut if sorcerers bring them forth, then such a summons is blasphemy, an abomination before the Tribes and Temple, and a sin so great that ages of burning cannot cleanse the fault. Abide not the sorcerer among you, for he comes to steal the bones of your fathers and dust of your tombs. He seeks to bind by power what is yours by right, to drag forth the warm spirits from their world between and bind them to their service like slaves and beasts.\n\nWho can know the shame of the dead, the ceaseless weeping of the necromancer's thrall? Cruel enough is the ancestor's service given in love to Hearth and Kin. But ghost or guardian, bonewalker or bonelord, summoned by profane ritual and bound by force to the corpse miner's will, how may such a spirit ever find rest? How may it ever find its way back to its blood and clan?\n\nOnly a righteous Dunmer, bound by blood to hearth and kin, bound by oath and service to the Temple, can call upon the spirits of the Dunmeri dead. Those foreign sorcerers of other races that invade our shores, shall they be permitted to rob our tombs, to bind our kin-spirits into sorcerous slavery, to steal the lives of our dead as well as our land of the living? No, I say, no, and no, three times more. Such necromancers must die, and their profane magics must die with them.\n\nAnd shall we tolerate the hidden hosts of the undead, the arrogant princes of necromancers, the ancient vampire demons who creep from their lairs in the West, seeking refuge in profane Daedric shrines, abandoned Dunmeri strongholds, and corrupted subterranean labyrinths of the detested Dwemer race? For ages the Great Houses and the Temple have kept our land clean of the vampire's taint, but now these undead lords and their vile cattle have returned. These vampires must die, and their corrupt cattle with them, and their blood taint must be forever erased by fire and stake."

msgid "By Priestess Adie Rodeau\n\nWelcome, young ones! As the subject of my annual children's sermon, I have chosen ""The Martyrdom of Saint Pelin."" Now I know you have probably heard this story already, but in this time of trouble I think it is good to revisit the tales of our ancestors so we may draw strength and lessons from them.  \n\nNow Saint Pelin lived back in the early part of the First Era, when the world was stranger than today. At that time Tamriel was largely untamed and our ancestors had to be strong and brave, for the woods and hills were home to things like bull-men, and centaurs, and fire serpents. \n\nSaint Pelin wasn't a saint at first, of course: he was a humble man, a beadle at the Chapel of Stendarr at the Bangkorai Garrison, where he tended to the spiritual needs of the soldiers guarding the walls. He had other tasks as well, such as bringing the sentries water when the sun was high. One day as he carried around his bucket dipper he noticed there were more guards than usual. He stopped at the main gate and asked his friend, Sergeant Clancie, why that was. ""It is because the Gray Host is coming,"" said Clancie, ""which is a terrible army of vampires from Verkarth, and I'm more than a little worried about it.""\n\n""Oh, my!"" said Pelin. ""Is there anything I can do to help you and the other soldiers?""\n\n""Pray for us, Pelin,"" said Clancie. ""For a great trial is upon us.""\n\nSergeant Clancie's words made Pelin anxious, so when he was done with his chores he climbed a tall tower and looked south. And there he saw the Gray Host coming out of the desert, a whole army of bat-men, wolves, and even worse things!\n\nSo Pelin went back to the chapel to pray, and as he heard the sounds of battle, he prayed to Stendarr, to Akatosh, to Julianos, to Kynareth, and to all their saints for help. \n\nBut then folk began to come into the chapel, setting up cots and tables and bringing in wounded soldiers for aid and surgery. ""Come and help us, Beadle,"" called the Doctor. ""It's your strong arms we need now, not your prayers.""\n\nSo Pelin came and looked at the wounded soldiers, and found them wondrous pale. ""What has happened to them, Doctor?"" he asked. ""These soldiers are as white as the sheets on my bed.""\n\n""It is the bat-men, Beadle,"" the Doctor said. ""When they bite our soldiers, they drain the blood from them in great draughts, leaving them pale and empty.""\n\n""Horror!"" cried Pelin. ""You're right, Doctor, this is time for more than prayers. For Stendarr says, 'He who fights hardest prays loudest.' I know nothing of fighting or of doctoring, but I will go to the battle and trust Stendarr to show me what to do.""\n\nSo Pelin ran to the fighting at the top of the great gate, where he found his friend, Sergeant Clancie, fighting a bat-man. The vampire beat at the sergeant with its wings and tried to grip him so as to bite, but Pelin grasped the bat-man by the legs so Clancie was able to kill it with his sword. \n\n""This is no place for you!"" the sergeant cried. ""The bat-men are at the gate, and soon they will burst it open and take the garrison!""\n\nPelin looked down and saw that what the sergeant said was true: a great press of bat-men was ramming against the gates, and the doors were bulging inward. Pelin cried, ""Is there nothing we can do?""\n\n""The stone wall here has been loosened by flying stones,"" said the sergeant. ""I had hoped to gather enough soldiers to push it down upon the bat-men—see, reinforcements are coming!—but the Gray Host will be through the gates before they can get here.""\n\n""Then I must delay them,"" said Pelin. And he flung himself from the battlements and upon the horde of vampires. \n\nThe wings of the bat-men broke Pelin's fall, and he landed among them hale and alive. ""Vampires!"" cried Pelin. ""Push not upon the gate, for what you want is here: a strong, healthy body full of fresh, warm blood. Take! Drink!""\n\nAnd the Gray Host turned as one and fell upon Pelin, fastening upon his veins. Then Pelin felt himself collapsing like a wine-sack at the harvest-festival, and knew that before the sergeant could gather enough soldiers he would be drained dry. So he prayed a mighty prayer, saying, ""O Stendarr, God of Justice, fill me with an ocean of blood that I might beguile these daemons away from the gate but a few minutes more!""\n\nAnd then Pelin felt himself filled anew with blood, flowing from him in a very fountain, and the divine geyser of gore drew every bat-man within sight into a great feeding mound before the gate. \n\nMeanwhile Sergeant Clancie and his friends pushed against the wall above, until all of a sudden the great stones went crashing down. The bat-men were nearly all slain, and by the time the ones who weren't had gathered their wits, they saw that the pursuing legions of Empress Hestra were almost upon them. And that was the end of the Gray Host.\n\nSo that is how a beadle from Bangkorai Garrison became a saint. Now I ask you, children—does not our time resemble that of Saint Pelin? Is there not once again an army at our gates? Yes, indeed. And that's why our leaders ask each and every one of us to do as much as we can to help defend our homeland. Some of us may even have to give our lives. \n\nSo when the time comes, tell yourself that you, too, have the strength to do what's needed. For I think, if we have to, we can all be as strong as a humble man like Pelin. Don't you?"
