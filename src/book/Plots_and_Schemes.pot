The most-recent location the Lion Guards ran from is Firebrand Watch. Rumor has it  the Red Rooks made a fortune when they plundered the abandoned fortifications there. Hurry to Firebrand Watch and gather whatever hasn't been carted off. The Lion Guard's loss must be our gain."

I have a new cause to champion and new allies to support.\n\nIf I regret one thing in all this, it's that I will now be forced to oppose my dear friend, Adusa-daro. We have known each other for so very long. I find it almost impossible to imagine that she will now oppose me. I have a vague hope of introducing her to the beautiful Lleraya, of converting her to our way of thinking. But I fear that my efforts will fail. She has well and truly fallen under Verandis' spell and I don't believe that anything I say will change that. I fear that, in the end, the proud and powerful Adusa-daro must die.\n\nShould I record the events that led to my epiphany? No, time is short and I have too much to do right now. Later, surely, there will be time enough to fill these pages with the wisdom I have acquired. Suffice it to say that Lleraya is not a monster. I am quite fascinated by the woman and eagerly wait to spend more time in her enchanting company. For now, let me just write that her words and deeds moved me. That her vision has become my vision. That her goals have become my goals.\n\nAnd it all starts here, in the quiet hamlet of Moira's Hope. The townsfolk are either well on their way to becoming bloodfiends loyal to our cause or they are dead and dying. Soon, we can spread the gift of Lleraya's blessing to all of Rivenspire—and then the chaos will be glorious!"

I don't know how we spread the word so quickly, but people seem to be coming from all over the region for the promised cure.\n\nI now have the opportunity to observe the afflicted through all stages of the Llodos plague. It begins with a mild fever and random bodily aches and pains. Oddly, afflicted suffering this stage of the plague have a terrible hunger that cannot seem to be satisfied. This stage of the plague lasts anywhere from three to seven days.\n\nThe second stage of the plague is marked by a high fever, overall weakness, and the appearance of open sores upon the body. Pain grips the afflicted, making most normal activities impossible to perform. During this stage of the plague, the afflicted's appetite disappears, and it is a struggle to make them eat and drink sufficient amounts of food and water to maintain their body weight. This stage of the plague can range from seven to fourteen days. If the afflicted doesn't throw off the plague during this period, chances of survival drop to almost zero.\n\nThe third stage of the plague marks the beginning of the end for the afflicted. The open sores now cover most of the afflicted's body, which burns with such heat that the afflicted becomes delirious and subject to hallucinations. The afflicted refuses to eat or drink, and any kind of movement results in agony. This stage of the plague is relatively short, lasting from one day in extreme cases to as long as five days for those unfortunate enough to hang on.\n\nThe final stage of the Llodos plague is perhaps the most fascinating. Of course, many of the afflicted simply die when the plague has run its course. And the death is extremely painful and heartbreaking to watch. But an increasing number of afflicted don't find a natural end. These unfortunates transform into seemingly undead creatures that the common folk call ""plague husks."" These creatures appear to be mindless engines of violence, intent on destroying all life they encounter.\n\nCan you imagine an army of such creatures?

By injecting the substance into a corpse's blood and letting it fester, the plague's potency increases tenfold! It must be the dead blood. We need more bodies. Luckily, Narsis can provide an abundant supply."

It will be a while yet before he will walk from this cavern on his own power, but the vessel, at least, is complete.\n\nAnd may whatever god they believe in help those who stand in its path."

It was steady and warm, like the breathing of some great beast.\n\nDoubtless it is the ingress to some hidden passage, but its means of access are impeccably obscured.\n\n27 Mid Year\n\nSuccess!

But we have survived the hammer blows. And we have been reborn! We are the Maulborn, and we have banded together with an altruistic spirit and a vision for a better Morrowind to provide the aid and assistance that the Tribunal is either unable or unwilling to give at this time.\n\nWith powerful benefactors from the most prominent Dunmer Houses and the support of nobles and commoners alike, the Maulborn strive to shelter the displaced, comfort the sick, care for the wounded, and feed the hungry. It is not only the popular thing to do, it is the right thing to do. To this end, the Maulborn have embarked on a massive recruitment campaign to fill our ranks with the able bodies we need to perform our charitable and compassionate work. Our goal is to create an army the likes of which Morrowind has never seen, an army of generosity to offset the hammer strikes that torment our land. \n\nTo this end, we are proud to announce the opening of our first facility to aid the afflicted. The victims of the Llodos plague need care and succor, and the Maulborn shall provide it. Moreover, the afflicted need not only a treatment for the plague—they need a cure! And through the work of our alchemists and nostrums, the Maulborn are prepared to provide a cure to all of the afflicted who want it. Come to our facility at Quarantine Serk, where you and your loved ones will find the care and the help you so desperately require. And, if fortune smiles upon us, you will also receive a cure for the Llodos plague.\n\nPeople of Morrowind, listen to the sound of a new kind of hammer. It strikes to create instead of destroy. To rise up instead of tear down. To help instead of hinder. This is the promise and the commitment of the Maulborn. Join us, and you shall be fulfilled! Seek us out, and you shall find the help you need. \n\nOn this, you have our word."

How easy it would be to sever their cord! To send them tumbling into the darkness beyond!\n\nBut imprecision is the greatest enemy. So I wait. I watch. And I learn.\n\nEntry 277\n<<4>> says the Crosstrees are vulnerable. Direct confrontation is out of the question. Better to sever those threads who stray from the rest, fraying the cord until it snaps.\n\nThis one is ready."

He could be manipulated. He could be forged into the weapon I needed to enact King Ranser's revenge.\n\nIt was easy enough to convince Count Verandis to aid my cause. And a simple forget-me draught was enough to wipe the memories from him. Getting his blood vassal to imbibe the potion was child's play. And when Verandis fed, the alchemical concoction passed from the vassal to him. It was just my good fortune that the Baron's wife was as ill as she was. They were all so worried about her and desperate for a miracle that they accepted what I offered them without question.\n\nBut enough of the past! It is the future I am more interested in right now. My living necromancy experiment worked! I was able to take the living flesh of others and create a totally different living creature. Even now, it grows more powerful in the ruins of Crestshade, awaiting my orders to head out and ravage the countryside. It isn't bogged down by the intelligence or demeanor of those who gave their living flesh to its creation—it is a new and unique entity ready to obey my every command! Imagine what I can do with an army of such creatures!\n\nSoon, all of Rivenspire will be under our control. Then I will convince the Baron to send his undead army and my creations south. This time, the outcome will be much different from Ranser's War. This time, the High King will fall. I have foreseen it. The power of the Ayleid relic told me so."
