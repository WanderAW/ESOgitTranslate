I am Rangidil, a prince of the True Temple,\nAnd I've fought in many a battle, and many a warrior\nHas tried to stop my blade and has failed.\nVery few can anticipate which blow I'm planning,\nAnd fewer, knowing that, know how to arrest the design,\nOr have the strength to absorb all of my strikes.\nThere is no greater master of shield blocking in all\nOf Morrowind\nThan here in the castle Abernanit.\n\nMy foe, dark lord Dagoth Thras, before you slay me,\nI beg you, tell me how you know how to block.""\nWickedly proud, Dagoth Thras heard Rangidil's plea,\nAnd decided that before he gutted the Temple champion,\nHe would deign to give him some knowledge for the afterlife,\nHow his instinct and reflexes worked, and as he started\nTo explain, he realized that he did not how he did it,\nAnd watched, puzzled, as Rangidil delivered what the tales\nOf Morrowind\nCalled ""The death blow of Abernanit."""
