We're tracking one of the vile creatures along the coast to the west of Alinor, near the vicinity of Welenkin Cove.\n\n* * *\nWe ran into a phenomenon that seemed to be not entirely natural in origin. A geyser sprang up, but instead of just spouting water, it also unleashed the terrible sea creatures that have been reported near Shimmerene and other parts of the island, the yaghra. Worse, there were also undead monstrosities among the unleashed horde.\n\n* * *\nWe need to confirm my findings, but I have come to the conclusion that the yaghra and the undead have been set upon us by some sort of Sea Sload magic."

They are presented here in terms comprehensible even by those of lesser intellectual attainment.\n\nONE:  Foraging is Mandatory, but Looting is Forbidden\n\nWhile it is true that regions brought under the protection of the Aldmeri Dominion are required to pay indemnity-in-kind to support Dominion forces, this indemnity is to be collected with a strict adherence to the Rule of Fifths: one-fifth of all tangible goods and currency in a Dominion-protected region belong to the Dominion. Personal looting is forbidden. \n\nTWO: Pay for What You Take\n\nPersonal goods acquired by troops in an occupied region are to be paid for at the appropriate market rate. For this purpose all troops are supplied with a liberal quantity of Dominion Scrip, paper currency which the locals in an occupied region will be able to redeem after hostilities cease. \n\nNOTE: Troops are not to accept Dominion Scrip as payment for goods or services. \n\nTHREE: Do Not Fraternize with the Locals\n\nThe locals in occupied regions often display vulgar behavior, subscribe to improper belief systems, and foment inappropriate ideas. Sometimes they even suffer a false sense of grievance against the Dominion which may manifest itself in dangerous misbehavior. Be a ""Safe Soldier,"" and fraternize only with those certified entertainers who have been admitted into the Recreation Compound. \n\nFOUR: Maintain Uniform Standards of Appearance\n\nDo not fall prey to the temptation to adopt local attire, no matter how comfortable or festive. Maintain that superior reserve that reflects true Aldmeri Propriety.\n\nFIVE: Tolerate No Disrespect\n\nThe forces of the Dominion Military are the physical incarnation of the Glory of the Aldmeri Peoples, and as such must be respected by members of the tertiary races. Failure to show proper deference to Dominion personnel or the Eagle Banner is to be immediately punished at the appropriate level of severity (as delineated in Article 317, Deference and Decorum). \n\nIf you have questions about any of the above, consult your superior officer, or apply to your unit ceremoniarch for the course in Advanced Aldmeri Propriety.\n\nIn the Queen's Name, \n\nLegate Calevarnel"

Damaging or destroying a Hist tree without a command-level order is expressly forbidden. In most mud-ridden, bug-infested, scale-skin settlements, the Hist tree is the only valuable resource worth taking … and it is very valuable.\n\nEach raiding party must include a contingent of sappers. Not wall-penetration specialists, but tree-sappers. Their weapons include tubes, pipes, drills, and portable distilleries. It is their job to recover as much ""Hist sap"" from these trees as possible.

Spot the meek and lowly Argonian with a simpering guise and a lilting tone of appeasement? He may not be as he seems, friend! After recent incursions close to Black Marsh, and the death of Captain Turpilinus Baibius under circumstances most vexing, we have reason to believe Shadowscales are active in this region. But what of this clandestine group and its dark purpose? \n\nShadowscales are reptilian kith born under the sign of the Shadow. Plucked at birth and offered to the detestable Dark Brotherhood, these hatchlings are a boon to their cause and are expertly trained in the arts of furtiveness and subtle bloodshed. When fully formed, they are embraced by these Sithis cultists and accept warrants for assassinations, just as their higher race kin have infamously done. Now that Shadowscales are incorporated into Argonian society, their targets benefit only the lizard-folk. How such targets are determined is still unclear.\n \nIt is believed the Shadowscales follow the identical five tenets of the hated Brotherhood (your Lore Master has the necessary texts to further your education on these matters). Through capture and torture of suspected members, we know that an order is never disobeyed or refused if given by a superior. A fellow Shadowscale is never a target of these cutthroats, and Shadowscales deserting the Brotherhood are hunted and slain. As our dealings with the Morag Tong have taught us, an assassin's guild functioning as an adjunct to an official government is a powerful threat: now the Argonians have organized such a force, which must be watched, infiltrated, and utterly confounded until broken."

Get that through your thick skull, for everything else depends on that.\n\nThe pretender Jorunn's soldiers will come in force, and when they do we must fade away. Our prize is buried beneath the fort. Taking Morvunskar was always just a means to an end. Hold it for as long as you can and then retreat to the burial vaults beneath. My traitorous brother will never suspect our true goals here, and his soldiers will never find the tunnel in time to stop us.\n\nMake sure you keep any important relics you find locked up tight. Never trust anyone where treasure is involved. But our primary goal must be to secure the remains and transport them out of there as quickly as possible.\n\n— Fildgor Orcthane"

The cave known as Hightide Hollow is definitely not one of them.\n\nThe last time I had checked on the place, a tribe of Goblins known as the Shadowsilks had moved into the place. Not all that unusual, truth be known, but what made me decide to come back for another look was the leader of this Goblin tribe. Somehow, someway, an Orc spellcaster of some sort had insinutated himself into the tribe's top spot, and I had to determine whether or not this was all some sort of plot by the Daggerfall Covenant to disrupt the region.\n\nLuckily, since my last visit, something else has apparently moved into the lava caves. Giant spiders! It appears, from my quick appraisal of the situation, that the spiders have overrun the Goblins and decimated the tribe.\n\nI don't think we'll have to worry about the Orc spellcaster and his Goblin followers now. \n\nWait a moment. I think I heard some—"
