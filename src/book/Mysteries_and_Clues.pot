After many years amongst the Bosmer, they amassed a storehouse of information.\n\nRealizing a need to preserve our knowledge against the ages, they excavated a cavern east of the mighty Strid. There, in its alabaster depths, they carved great halls and sealed them against the ravages of erosion and time.\n\nThey summoned our greatest architect to do these things, and a great enchantment was placed upon its walls to stave off putrefaction and decay.\n\nThe ruins would stand until the White-Gold Tower fell to dust and bone in the ashes of old Cyrod. They would deliver our memory for generations to come, and seal us as the immortal masters of Tamriel, itself."

Alas, it seems that while the great Dragonhorn once rested within these halls, it has long since been stolen away. And, by the few accounts I could discover, I believe that the theft was performed by none other than a Dragon.\n\nWhile it pains me to learn of such a grave dishonor to our order, I am more resolved than ever to get back what is rightfully ours. I have surmised that we'll find this foul creature in a dormant volcano, located in Southern Elsweyr. I have also learned its name; Vahlokzin. The map included herein shows the way to its lair.\n\nIf we find this beast, we will find the Dragonhorn, and I can think of no greater pleasure than slaying such an enemy. It's time for myself and my fellow soldiers to finally prove the might of the Dragonguard. After all, what better way to return our glory than with a Dragon hunt?\n\nThough we are small in number, we are brave of heart. We are Dragonguard, and we will face this Dragon or die in the attempt, as our order always has."

We should find the entrance to this sanctuary a little ways south of Windhelm, in Eastmarch.\n\nI also found records that indicate something a bit hard to believe. According to several reports, the Dragonhorn we seek is indestructible, both from physical and magical means. I know of no other Dragonhorn that had such a power. How was the Dragonguard able to create this weapon?\n\nIt also makes me curious as to what matter of Dragon the Horn of Ja'darri was carved from. It must have been a truly powerful beast. Was he called Ja'darri? It seems unlikely, given the name's distinctly Khajiiti sound. \n\nLet us hope that when we find the Dragonhorn, so too shall we uncover its secrets."

It was we who failed to protect our Emperor, we who allowed that vile snake to swallow the Empire whole. Disbanded and disgraced, those of us left with the decency of shame have scattered to the winds. And so our pride is broken and our order in disarray.\n\nBut I have learned of an artifact which may become our salvation; the Horn of Ja'darri. Legend states that it is the most powerful Dragonhorn that our order ever created, possessed of a mysterious self-replenishing magic unlike any other Dragonhorn.\n\nWith such a relic, I believe we can rally others to our cause and bring honor back to the Dragonguard. It seems, however, that Wind Scour does not hold the Horn of Ja'darri. And so we travel to Storm Talon next, in hopes that we may find the Dragonhorn within that sanctuary's halls."

Then, in the fullness of time, I wanted to pass into Sovngarde, wife at my side, to find whatever reward waited for us. I never expected to end the very things that gave me happiness. To be the hand that murdered my wife and daughters.\n\nBut sometimes things happen. Evil corrupts even the most pure. The most innocent. My family. My wife, my daughters. They hurt others. Innocent people. They did unthinkable things. The power they wielded when they were together was pure evil. But I ended it. I buried them all. In different places. Made sure they'd never be together again.\n\nThe firstborn, Jolinne. I laid her to rest in her favorite place to play as a child. I still remember her playing tag with her sisters in that alleyway. She'd hide behind the strange stones and surprise anyone who walked by. They'd be mad at first, but then they'd see her smile and move on, headed for the Sober Nord or Merchant Row. She was such a playful child before the Daedric corruption of Molag Bal pulled her into the cult.\n\nShe was the first to turn after my wife. The first I found, blood and knife in hand. An evil grin I didn't recognize adorned her beautiful face. I had to do what I did. Kyne help me, I had to.\n\nThe second-born, Fjorna. I laid her to rest in the shrine dedicated to the things she grew up dreaming about. Dragons. Whenever we visited the springs at Wittestadr, Fjorna would insist that we stop at the nearby ruins to pay our respects to the fabled creatures. She said that she could sense their presence. She'd run off to the same spot every time. A smalI clearing behind a strange, curved slab of stone. She liked that spot. I hope she'll be at peace there.\n\nIf only her mother hadn't gotten a hold of her. She was the closest to me of my daughters. She could hold her own in a fight. Won more often than not. A good girl.\n\nBut she too fell into evil of the cult. I had to take matters into hand again. So I did what was necessary, and I wept and wept into the night. Nothing before this had ever been so hard.\n\nThe third-born, Valdia. My little girl. My darling. For her, the only place that would suit was where I took her each year on her day of birth. To ride the horses at a little place in southern Eastmarch. The stablemaster would always welcome her, and my Valdia would be so happy. She'd sit by the small pond near the house and she'd pick those beautiful red flowers. She loved it there and horses were her favorite animals in the world. Which is why I was shocked when I found her favorite horse dead on that morning, its heart carved out. She was holding it, still pumping blood, in her hand and grinning maniacally.\n\nI never asked for this. I never wanted this. But I felt responsible. As if it was my fault. As if I had failed them all somehow.\n\nI did unspeakable things, but for the greater good. I never killed any innocents. But I killed my family. Perhaps this makes me more of a monster than they were, but I did what I thought was right. Sonya spoke of sacrificing the girls. Using them to gain ultimate power from Molag Bal. I couldn't let that happen to my little girls. I just couldn't!\n\nI hope they can forgive me one day. I hope they welcome me into Sovngarde, back into their arms.\n\nI miss them. More and more. Every day. I think it's time to finally join them."

msgid "<<1>>,\n\nIf this message reaches you, I must assume you did what I could not and stopped my wife. I apologize for not accompanying you to the ruins. My family's blood already stains my hands, and I couldn't bear to go through that ordeal all over again.\n\nTo think that everything I had to do ten years ago could have come undone, that it could have all been for nothing, I couldn't stand the thought! At the same time, I couldn't end their lives. Not again. I had to let that fall to you. And for that, I'm sorry.\n\nYou won't see me again. My time is done. I had hoped to die a glorious death, in battle beside the Skald King. Instead, I die a coward's death. May Kyne forgive me.\n\nI've left a small reward for you. It's in my chest, behind this tent. My journal is also there. It contains the entire story of what I was forced to do.\n\nKyne watch over you, my friend. Kyne watch over us all.\n\n— Hadmal"
