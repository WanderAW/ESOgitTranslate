msgid "A Treatise on Conscientious Larceny\n\nBy Zizar-dar\n\nTo steal a thing is simplicity itself. One merely takes what one will and that is that. Even a treasure jealously guarded can be stolen easily under the right circumstances, but such things will not be discussed here.\n\nThis treatise hopes the reader will become a capable pilferer of found things. Methods, distractions, and tools of the trade will not be discussed herein, so if you are a hungry ja'Khajiit looking to make your way on the streets of Senchal, look elsewhere. (Really! What are you doing here? You should be out casing marks!)\n\nBandits, burglars, defalcators, and cheats—keep reading. You might learn a thing or two.\n\nWho Is Worthy of Your Gift?\n\nAny able pilferer knows the next heist is merely a question of time and place, but to keep your heart as light as your gloves, you would do well to be wary of your target!\n\nEasy marks are abundant, but the majority are as desperate as you are. Ignore them! You won't make a name for yourself fleecing ditch-diggers and scullions of their hard-won dinners, and they certainly won't sing the songs every Senchal dreg knows by heart and hair.\n\nNo, look for the merchant whose purse lies buried behind three tall walkers with etched swords and inlaid plate! Watch for the wizard whose tower sends alchemical stenches billowing into the canvas city. Seek out the pomp-pursed dandyclaw whose grounds are free of flicktongues.\n\nNever take all, just a portion! They will deem what you took an ""acceptable loss."" Admitting their loss would send every shinglestep in town leaping through their casements, which is why they rarely inform the guard.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that they also have the most to pilfer. But what is worth taking, and more importantly, what is there to do with all the riches you've liberated from lightless prisons?\n\nWhat To Do With a Heavy Purse?\n\nTreasure, whether in pockets or in the ground, weighs heavily on mind and the spirit.\n\nIt can be tempting to take famous treasures. Who has not heard the many tales of Rajhin? But as the tales suggest, some treasures are difficult to move and are often worth more in trouble than the gold you'll get for them.\n\nCoin is best, of course. It's small and easy to move. Jewelry comes next, though you may have to melt pieces down if they are too closely filigreed.\n\nPotions can be just as valuable—if not immediately useful to your trade. Look especially for those with restorative properties, for these can be priceless when properly plied.\n\nDon't overlook sundries, either! Frequently a treasure will be too well guarded or trapped with snares to justify the effort, but the mark is not always a lost cause. Only the most paranoid take precautions with the sugarcloset, for who would impede his own sweet-tooth? Much the same with the cupboards, for a hungry belly needs filling fast and tripwires only get in the way.\n\nDo not be too prideful to make off with these things. While they will rarely be missed, they can fill your belly and bring you fame to rival even the luckiest moonlighters!\n\nWhere Should You Flee?\n\nTake as much as you can carry! Fill your pockets and parcels with whatever you can fit, such that it overflows your waistband and bites into your back! Your bounty is as important to your escape as it is to your purse.\n\nWhen you are pursued —as you often will be—spoils secured properly about your vitals will throw off arrows raining down from the walls.\n\nIn the streets, cut release ties to spill out your treasures into the paths of your pursuers. Throw them to the crowds! Their scrambling for your riches will sow confusion, creating obstacles for your escape.\n\nNot only will these efforts delay your pursuers, news of your open hand will spread like wildfire through the streets. What is more valuable than your name? It will buy you safe haven in times of need, food for your belly in lean times, and more importantly will carry you through the darkest of life's troubles.\n\nAnd when you are old and can no longer leap between rooftops, you can rest easily among your childrens' children, assured that your legacy is as clean as a well-greased tumblecatch.\n\nGood luck in your exploits! When they are sung through the taverns and slums of the world, Zizar-dar will be sure to carry the tune."

They return to the Haven after every voyage and we never see them until the next trip. They must have something special in there. \n\nI am still going to try to get in there and join Blackheart's crew officially.\n\nDay 71:\n\nI know I impressed him now.

Let us take for an example leaves of Heart's-Ease, a common anodyne found in every pharmacopeia. The leaves are brewed as a bedtime tea by those who have trouble falling asleep. However, if the leaves are dried and converted to a powder, one can create a powerful soporific. Six grains of this, added to a night-watchman's ale, are almost guaranteed to put him in a deep sleep within a quarter-hour. Give him twenty-four grains, and he'll never wake again."

You won't believe the things I've heard about what people are finding in Craglorn. \n\nI know you have an interest in the most ancient of relics, and I shouldn't have to remind you (though I will anyway) that the Nedes themselves were known to inhabit that territory in antiquity. Can you imagine the prestige owning even a Nedic chamber pot, much less an inscription or warding-prism, would garner? I can!\n\nWe must meet again and try our luck at recovering one of these priceless relics. When is the earliest you can meet me in Dragonstar? Oh, and just ignore all the chatter about how dangerous it is over there. I'm sure it's nothing we can't handle!\n\nYour Fellow Collector,\nEmutaril"

msgid "For a while, I thought that my decision to join the Red Rooks was the smartest thing I'd ever done. What farm girl hasn't dreamed of a life of adventure? And we started out with a cause and a purpose. Turmoil throughout the land had left our livelihoods shattered and our families in desperate straits. My family couldn't even afford to feed me, let alone care for my six brothers and sisters. So I left home with nothing but the clothes on my back and a rusty old sword that had belonged to my mother, and I went looking for the Red Rooks.\n\nOh, I had heard rumors about the Red Rooks. Simple trappers and farmers just like me who had enough of the high-and-mighty nobles making life impossible for the common folk of the land. They had banded together to steal from the rich and give to the poor. At least, that's what the rumors told me. I couldn't wait to join them, to live a life of action and purpose.\n\nIt wasn't hard to hook up with a band of Red Rooks, and they welcomed me into their fold well enough. They gave me a uniform, and I felt a mix of pride and embarrassment as I put it on. I guess the Red Rook leaders want us to look like an army, but I couldn't help wondering if it was such a good idea to advertise our presence in such a bold and obvious manner. But who was I to second guess those who were older and far more experienced than I?\n\nThings were going fine for a while, although it seemed like we were robbing whoever was available and keeping whatever we earned for ourselves. Still, I was a valued member of the group and I had started to develop some strong friendships—especially with Kala and Morin. We were becoming inseparable! \n\nJust when things were really looking good, I started to suspect that there was something more ominous at play than a bunch of farmers trying to be noble bandits.\n\nMy suspicions were confirmed when I saw our leaders meeting with those Bloodthorn maniacs. I hope we aren't really considering an alliance with the cultists. That's not what I signed on for! I want to have a little fun and earn some gold. I certainly don't want to see Glenumbra destroyed and covered in corrupted vegetation! \n\nNow I don't know what to do. Maybe I should talk to Kala and Morin. They'll know what we should do."

msgid "Agnor gro-Mulak,\n\nBy the time you finish reading this, someone you know will be dead.\n\nI see you found a place to stay. A warehouse at the docks? Really? You must be in terrible trouble to be hiding in place like that. Then again, trouble has a way of finding you.\n\nYou may be wondering why your armor is missing. And your weapons. And your clothes. And that filthy pallet you were sleeping on.\n\nAnd if you have any conscience at all, you might be wondering about your wives back home. Why did you run away, Chief?\n\nBy the way, your first wife is hilarious. You remember her, don't you? That alchemist with the cruel laugh you like so much? She and I were talking the other day about the way you've been running our tribe, and I gotta say, Chief, her laugh sounds really cruel when she's talking about you.\n\nRemember that one time you led us on a raid into a cave full of Goblins? Remember that? They were just a wretched band of Goblins, but you fumbled the ambush, and they killed three of our best warriors. I remember the screaming at their funeral. I don't remember you screaming for them, Chief.\n\nOr how about that time we sent a shipment of swords to Daggerfall to sell to the Redguards? That was an expensive shipment, but someone didn't send enough guards with the caravan. Do you remember who that was? I'm the stealthiest scout you've got, and I could have saved that shipment, but you never sent me.\n\nYou did some good things, though, I must admit. You taught us about the Code of Malacath. Like the part where a tribe can't get a new chief until the cowardly old one is dead. Or the part where only the chief gets wives, and none of the rest of us get any.\n\nI'm really tired of that.\n\nBy the way, Atugol says hello. Remember her? With her cruel laugh and her extensive knowledge of alchemy?\n\nI know you're a bit slow sometimes, but I'm sure you're figuring it out. None of my brothers ever had a chance in that Goblin cave, so I don't see why you should have a chance now. Maybe that's why you ran away, Chief.\n\nBut don't worry. It's not like Atugol would poison you. She wouldn't kill you so close to camp. She'd do it from far, far away.\n\nBecause when you die, it's not going to be poison. It's going to be a nice clean sword thrust.\n\nAnd that's why I'm standing behind you right now, Agnor."

msgid "My execution is tomorrow. The turnkey asks what I'd like for my last meal.\n \nBring me paper, I say. A quill and a candle.\n \nPerhaps the Jarl would like a confession. I would rather pass the time.\n \nWhen my father's harem burned down and our family fortune was lost to the ashes, my brother and I set to begging in the gutters of Elsweyr. I will never forget the first time we stole a traveler's purse. It was almost by accident. Just a slip of the claw and the pouch fell into our hands. We ate like kings that night. We slept in a warm bed for the first time in months.\n \nSoon after, my brother and I took up the knife. The gang we joined treated us as the dirty orphans we were. We robbed, we scammed, we cut and ran and years of debauchery and hard living took their toll. I lost half my left ear in a knife fight with a blind drunk Argonian.\n \nI wanted to give up, but my brother, he dreamed bigger, better.\n \nMy brother wanted to make it to Cyrodiil and become legit merchants. We had a plan. One final heist of a northbound caravan said to be filled with jewels.\n \nSomething went wrong. My brother could not stop the horses on time, and I stood helplessly by and watched the wagon plummet over a cliff. But as I picked through the wreckage, my devastation turned to excitement. There were no jewels, but there were plenty of luxurious wolf pelts, horker tusks and mammoth hides, more than enough to buy my way to Cyrodiil. I'd follow in the footsteps of so many of my kind. A traveling merchant, someone with a respectable profession.\n \nI had all the furs bundled in my pack when I saw my brother's broken body. His ears were still warm, and I shut his eyes for the last time. This was his dream. And he would want me to go. But what I wanted, well, the caravan guards were coming. I had to go, but I couldn't just leave his body to rot.\n \nMy brother gave me my first skin. It was to be a memento. But in the darkness of the fence's cabin, the coin hit my hand heavy. Then she looked at my brother's pelt and offered three times the amount of any other fur. Disgust caught in my throat, but did not live very long. I realized the cost of such a forbidden luxury. The value, the demand, the respect.\n \nThis is what I wanted.\n \nIt became easier. A dark alley, a gag in one hand and a quick slice across the throat. Gently hold the body as it bleeds. I became faster, my cuts precise and fluid. I peel the skin with one motion and kept the merchandise pristine, in one piece.\n \nI became rich. Far richer than anyone in my family had ever been. Yet I was careful. My stronghold was well-hidden, and practically impenetrable. I hired the men that used to employ me. We moved frequently on less-traveled roads when we hunted in the wild. We stalked the back alleys we used to sleep in when we hunted in the city. I grew so rich that I no longer needed to dirty my own hands.\n \nPatchwork colored furs fetched the best price among the Bosmer. Argonians preferred the pelts completely skinned and tanned. Orcs prized the thick, waterproof leather of the Argonians. Humans most often bought tails and ears. I had to employ an alchemist and a master craftsman for a couple odd requests, but I didn't ask questions when the gold piled up.\n \nAnd now I'm a prisoner. Maybe I became careless. Maybe I let too many secrets slip between the sheets. The raid of my fortress was a massacre. They took me alive, barely. That was their mistake. My enemies should have killed me when they had the chance.\n \nI have one lockpick. And the northern wall of my cell is weak from disrepair. My head shall not roll tomorrow.\n \nI am not finished with the trade. There will always be buyers. Someday, I will sell my own skin for a king's ransom, as my name is legend. And yours shall rot in the gutters with your bones.\n \n— The Fur Trader"

msgid "The following is an account of the events encountered during the interrogation of the witch Henghild of Wittestadr by Garmath, Witchhunter of Direfrost.\n\nThe interrogation was unremarkable for a time, and the crone had no unusual reaction to the various implements of torture beyond the expected screaming and pleading. It was when her blood first spilled that the manifestation began.\n\nThe witch grew suddenly still, as if in a trance. At once, a chill wind filled the chamber, and the flame of the braziers turned an unearthly shade of green. Echoing all about, yet seemingly coming from no discernable source, all present heard a guttural, but unmistakably cogent chant, almost like a religious invocation. Upon reflection, I suspect that this was the language of Oblivion; the obscene tongue of the Daedric Princes. \n\nThe iron chains that bound Henghild to the slab crumbled, impossibly, and fell away. Her back arched and her eyes rolled back in her head. Slowly, her body rose with no visible means of levitation, suddenly hovering several feet above the slab. \n\nAfter a moment, her mouth opened and she began to speak. But it was not the voice of the crone that issued forth, but rather the voice of a Daedric abomination. Her words were transcribed by no fewer than three witnesses. I record them here, in their entirety:\n\n""Pain unto innocence. Screams in the dark. Nocturnal is here.\n\n""My loyal servant is tortured and burned, bound and tormented, bereft of her life.\n\n""The clan called Direfrost think themselves righteous, but Nocturnal has seen their wickedness.\n\n""My curse be upon you, and your descendants.\n\n""Your judgement will first be rendered in the form of an Ice Queen who comes in the guise of a pauper.\n\n""Your blood shall be frozen. Your torment long and painful.\n\n""And when your savior comes to release you, know that your true suffering has only just begun.\n\n""There will be a reckoning between past and present, and the name Direfrost will lie in tatters before the end. \n\n""A new Ice Queen will bring unto Direfrost all the anguish of Oblivion, and you shall know true suffering."" \n\nAt this moment, the crone's body burst into green flame, and crumbled to ash."

Physique is critical as at least five will be used for labor. Tall and skinny would be preferred for the remaining two. If one might have blue eyes, this would be preferred as well.\n\n—	Two elderly men, but they must be healthy. We're not looking for men on their deathbeds. We're looking for these men to serve as chaperones, so it's also critical they have good eyesight.\n\n—	Lastly, any gender/age is acceptable but it's of highest necessity that we get someone who has intimate knowledge of swine, as we are in desperate need of a new pig-keeper. The last one was eaten.\n\nFor any acquisition that fulfills these requests, we will offer twice the normal rate.

And because I hope that others who have also fallen into the sorry state of skooma addiction may therefore hear of my story, of how I fell into despair, and how I once again found myself and freed myself from my own self-imposed chains.\n \nBecause it is widely known to all Khajiit, who may be expected to know, that there is no cure for addiction to skooma, that once a slave to skooma, always a slave to skooma. Because this is widely known, it is taken to be true. But it is not true, and I am living proof.\n \nThere is no miracle cure. There is no potion to be taken. There is no magical incantation which frees you from the thrill of skooma running through your blood.\n \nBut it is through the understanding of that thrill, and the acceptance of the lust within oneself for that thrill, and the casting aside of the shame that the thrillseeker feels when he cannot set aside what becomes in the end his only comfort and pleasure, it is through this knowledge and understanding that the victim comes to the place where choices may be made, where despair and hope may be separated.\n \nIn short, only knowledge and acceptance can deliver into the slave's hands the key that opens his shackles and sets him free."

I've never felt so proud and so free as today, the day we dedicate ourselves to serving others.\n\n24th, Sun's Dawn\nI look at the wagons laden with goods and gold headed for Hallin's Stand and I feel proud. I can't help but notice how much more we've been able to accumulate each week. I believe the Divines are blessing us for our selfless ways.\n\n4th, First Seed\nI'm throwing another feast tonight for the boys. After all our hard work, we deserve it. I think I'll wear the new tunic I got, the one with the gold laces. I need to maintain my authoritative status. \n\nI just realized, that little house on river I always wanted in Wind Keep—if I just hold back a few more gold drakes this month, I think I can actually buy it!\n\n17th, First Seed\nIt seems that many of the people who accepted our aid in Hallin's Stand didn't even need it. They weren't impoverished, just greedy. Some of them took the clothes and food we sent and sold them at the marketplace! This month, I'm not going to bother sending so much. Just means I can retire to that little house in Wind Keep that much sooner!\n\n28th, First Seed\nI've just realized we're missing a great opportunity when we rob these noblemen. If we take a few of them and ransom them back to their families, next month we can double our take! And it'll serve them right, the parasites."

Your orders are simple: find the fort and turn it into a base of operations for the Red Rooks.\n\nWhat could be better than a fort we can move right into? It will help us further establish our presence in King's Guard, and it will provide another layer of protection in case the Bloodthorn Cult turns against us.\n\nAlso, prepare for a meeting with Valenwe and her entourage. It would be good to add their unique skills to our cause."
