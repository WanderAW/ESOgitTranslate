When you are on the open seas and look to the moon, know that it is the same moon that I too look upon. May that bring you comfort in the storms. Until your return, Therrun, I seal this letter with a kiss.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nHevra"

I wonder, if it were me leaving, would she look the same?\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWhile scouring the hallway floor, I heard sobbing from Arlie's room. It isn't right she should be so sad. Maybe there's something I can do.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nBrought Arlie flowers. She's still sad, but it was good to see her smile.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWent hunting with Baron Edrald. Everything was fine until we found that fox. We pursued, but became separated in the mountains. While trying to find my way through, I came upon a bear. It startled my horse, throwing me into the rocks nearby. Then it reared up to strike. If the Baron hadn't come upon me then, I'd be done for.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nI've decided to tell Arlie how I feel. Life is too short for waiting.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nI think I've made things worse. Arlie ran off crying. Of course she did. How could I ever compare to Federic!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nArlie came to see me while I was unloading casks of wine from <<2>>. She asked me to come see her in the old windmill.\n\nWe talked for hours. About Federic. About us. She says we should spend more time together, that she isn't as lonely with me to talk to!\n\nBut that isn't all. While we were talking, the Baroness came into the mill and hid something up on the second floor. I don't think she saw us, but we should be more careful from now on.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nThe Baron came to me today and asked what my intentions were toward Arlie. She told her mother about me, and is quite distraught.\n\nI told him how I feel and that I would never do anything to hurt her. I even offered to leave!\n\nHe told me that wouldn't be necessary. I think he understands.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nReceived a shipment from <<3>>. Unusual stuff. Lots of powders, dried plants, and some kind of shimmery gemstones. The Baroness had me take them down to the basement for storage.\n\nFunny. The smell reminds me of Arlie's grandmother."

The pupils of her eyes were split like a goat's and her teeth were flat like those of a horse. She was spurned and outcast and laughed at by the other Khajiiti children. So terrible!\n\nEven her own parents grew to be ashamed of her, for she was clumsy as well. The girl's balance was awful for her lack of tail and she could not hear as keenly as her kin for her tiny ears. She could not hunt, nor could she steal, nor could she weave magic. The girl felt so, so alone, even in the company of her own kind.\n\nSo she ran, far, far away across Tamriel, hiding amongst merchant caravans and eating the most revolting garbage and refuse just to survive. When found, she was tossed out into the mud or beaten with sticks. They called her a monster! How awful!\n\nThere was one bright ray in her life, however. One day she encountered a magnificent traveling circus, comprised of people much like herself. They did not spurn her for her appearance, for they were as freakish as she! They taught her to play the dulcimer and crush bones with her flat teeth for the amusment of others. \n\nOf course, the girl still felt alone all the time, but she was happy because she realized that she didn't have to be alone by herself."

Honestly, sometimes I think my goats have a more exciting life than I do. Every time I bring them here to the ruins, it's like they're seeing them for the first time. I envy them. But every day is the same for Najan and Adeena. Same meal, same awkward conversation, same tedious love-making. I can't even be angry with her. When I look across the table all I feel is … nothing.\n\n12th First Seed\n\nI can scarcely believe what I've found. One of my smaller goats, Husul, ran off while I was kicking dung off my sandal. I gave chase and found he had scrambled down into a vault beneath the ruins. It's dark down here, but not so dark that I need a candle to see. These old blue stones glow and hum softly. Even though it's nothing but cold, wet stone, there is something almost inviting about this place. I have decided to call it Husul's Cave. I can't wait to explore it more thoroughly. I already noticed some old books just waiting to be read.\n\nIn the meantime, I must go suffer through another flavorless meal with Adeena. She's always asking me if I'm pleased with the food. Offering to wash my clothes. Ruptga help me.\n\n16th First Seed\n\nI've found something—something that will change everything. I was leafing through one of the old books I found when I noticed something shimmering stuck in between the leaves. It was a talisman. It appeared simple at first, but when I rubbed away the dirt and grime I saw it was something priceless. \n\nThen an ethereal woman appeared. She was beautiful beyond measure. I could scarcely speak when I saw her, but she was so kind—she simply giggled. A sweet little laugh. It put me at ease long enough for me to introduce myself.\n\nHer name is Anexiel. She says she is an ancient spirit of the ruins—something like a saint, I guess. To my mind, she's something far greater than that. Her eyes are like the water in an oasis, and she has a voice like … oh look at me, playing the poet! I cannot deny it—I have fallen in love with this spirit. If only she were flesh and blood … I would make her mine.\n\n18th First Seed\n\nI am in agony. Anexiel is all I've ever wanted. Each day my love for her grows, yet we cannot be together. She remains a wisp of air—tied to these twice-cursed ruins! Oh how she teases me! Dressed in that shimmering silk, tracing her ghostly fingertip down my shoulder. It's all so … intimate. I had to tell her how I felt. She said she needed time to think. I hope I haven't ruined things.\n\n24th First Seed\n\nShe loves me! I knew it! Sweet Anexiel finally confessed her love today, but now she is miserable too. Gods help us.\n\n25th First Seed\n\nShe has a plan! My sweet Anexiel has been walking the halls of the vault, thinking, for what seems like days. She finally came to me and said that she can become flesh and blood, but she needs a ""vessel."" Someone she can step into and live inside. I don't know how it works exactly. All I know is this vessel needs to have some magic in its blood. I started to despair, but then I remembered my wife. My Adeena. She's always had something in her. Something magical. Her mother called it ""the gleam.""  Maybe that will be enough. It has to be enough.\n\nI'm bringing her here tomorrow."

He glanced at me several times these past weeks as I brought dinner to the table or poured the wine. He just smiles and looks into my eyes. Like I'm an equal. Not as if I were a young woman merely there to refill his flagon or clear away the dirty dishes, but as someone he might actually be interested in. I don't know what to think of it. I'm probably just imagining it, dreaming about what life would be like if I didn't have to serve and clean every day. It's a dream, but I can hope that it comes true. Can't I?\n\nI wasn't imagining things! Tonight in the hallway, Lord Maurice pulled me aside. He asked if I was married. If I had a family. Speechless would be a good word for my reaction. He's so—what's the word I'm looking for? Kind? Different? His father and mother beat me repeatedly for simple transgressions. But their son isn't like that. He's so nice. I'm still having a difficult time believing it. He wants to see me again. Alone. I'm not sure what to think about all this.\n\nLord Maurice came to me again. He said he wanted to tell me something. He took my hand and led me off into the night. Hand in hand, we snuck through the gardens and sat on a bench beneath the moons. The way he looked at me sent shivers down my spine. \n\nOur love is forbidden. A rich noble like him and me, a simple servant. Still, we care for each other deeply. He plans to tell his parents of our love soon. I hope that goes well."

I left Giran snoring softly in our bed, put on a heavy robe, and stepped outside to feel the night air on my face. As I stood there, looking into the darkness, my gaze happened upon him. He was leaning against a tree, cloaked almost completely in shadows, but I could feel his eyes upon me. He seemed lonely. Full of longing. Hungry. I looked away for only a moment, flush with shyness, but when I looked back he was gone.\n\nI saw him again last night, as we were returning home from dinner at my sister's house. He was watching me, I know it. At first, I was frightened.

Oh, why am I having these unfathomable urges? Maybe when Giran takes his watch at the Northpoint cemetery tonight, I can sneak out of our house in the fishing village and try to find my stranger. Look into his dark, bottomless eyes. Feel his cold lips upon my neck …."

msgid "Once there was a shining city, Erokii, and its princess was the radiant Anurraame. She was considered the envy of all the Ayleid nobility for her beauty, grace, and wisdom were unsurpassed.\n\nIn time, she was married to the prince of a distant but great city. It was to be an alliance that spread across Tamriel. The prince was renowned for his martial prowess and stubborn honor, but he loved his new bride Anurraame dearly.\n\nFor a time, they were happy, or, at least, they seemed so. But as the years wiled away, Anurraame's husband was away more and more, and duty proved a poor substitute for passion. \n\nSo it came to pass that Anurraame took a young champion of Erokii for a lover. Strong and gleaming with youthful light and energy, Anurraame's lover gave her what the old, distant prince could not—the thrill of infatuation and friendship.\n\nAnurraame was careful at first to keep her affair a secret, lest she shame her husband. But caught up in passion's capricious winds, she became more and more reckless, and soon her dalliance was discovered.\n\nSpurned and infuriated, Anurraame's husband arrayed his full army before Erokii and laid siege to the city. The princess vowed to face him with fortitude and called on her lover to muster his forces in defense of the city, which he promised he would.\n\nBut when the day of battle came, her lover's forces appeared beside her husband's. His undying passion had been subverted by coin.\n\nDesperate and enraged at her lover's betrayal, Anurraame called on the Daedra for help destroying her enemies and defending her city. Mephala answered and commanded Anurraame to pour all her tears into a basin. Mephala then imbued the tears with the power of the princess's hatred for her traitorous lover, hatred which had formed from the potent seed of the princess's love.\n\nThe tears, so empowered, hardened into an artifact, the Tear of Anurraame. When the time of battle came, Anurraame took the artifact to the highest tower of the city and as the armies raged outside the city's walls, she unleashed its power, destroying the armies and the city in the flash of an eye.\n\nAll that remains of Erokii, and of Anurraame herself, is a ruined crypt, but there have been whispers throughout the ages that the Tear was not destroyed, and that it's waiting in the rubble, still to be found."

I believe the Hist spoke to both of us, to ensure we would both be where we could not help but meet and fall in love. This despite my innermost belief I'd never marry.\n\nThe first stir caught me by surprise. I put away items in the shop, organizing what I could amongst the clutter, when suddenly I heard my own voice in my mind say, ""Wait for him.""\n\n""For …?"" I asked aloud, startled out of my reverie.\n\nSilence.\n\nMy quiet sensibility replaced by confusion, I turned abruptly, knocking over the lamp, which flung an arc of burning oil across the room.\n\nOil landed everywhere, from the piles of fabric, to the litter of papers, and the straw scattered over the floor. In a single moment, a modest light source turned the crowded room into a fire pit.\n\nCoral tongues licked across the dried herbs hanging from the ceiling, and I realized I'd been standing still, slack-jawed, as smoke and heat and flame swirled around.\n\nThe hut had never seemed so large as it did then. Dark with smoke, bright with fire, its air filled with a dull, creaking roar. I squinted against the elements, my hand across my mouth, and staggered toward the ever-receding door.\n\n""Anyone in there? Anyone?""\n\n""Me!""\n\nI reached the door as it burst open, causing the flames to surge upwards and out with an almost celebratory leap. A dark hand grabbed mine, pulling me out and away.\n\n""Are you hurt?""\n\nCoughing, I shook my head. ""I'm all right. But the store ….""\n\nWe both turned to look. The fire, so unruly within the confines of the hut, had met its match with the wet thatch roof.\n\n""Thank you for helping me,"" I said, turning to face my rescuer at last.\n\nOur eyes locked in recognition. The Hist had chosen us for each other, and neither of us would need to wait any longer."

msgid "Dearest,\n\nI will not be in port for long, but I do have enough time to spare for a pot of a tea with these friendly Argonians and to draft a few quick letters. When the tide shifts, I will be at sea once more, pursuing those dastardly Renrijra Pirates.\n\nPerfidious Khajiit! I will pursue those pirates to the world's edge, if need be!\n\nYou embarrass me with your constant need for declarations of undying love, but rest assured that I echo your sentiments in return.\n\nLately, I have been preoccupied. The Renrijra raid our shores, trying to claim our lands as their own. I always knew cats were territorial, but those Khajiiti raiders pursue this as an obsession. Those pirates are relentless!\n\nOn the rare occasions when we capture one, it is always the same frustrating dialogue. They are quick to speak of territorial rights and political reform, and so on and so forth. But really, I know the truth. They are little more than smugglers and sea-raiders propping up their criminal activities behind a facade of ideals. They lie! And they shall pay!\n\nThey scowl, these pirates. They sneer, even when held in bonds. They take pride in their contemptuous nature. In fact, it is reflected in their very name: ""Renrijra Krin."" I have heard it translated as ""the Mercenary's Grin"" or ""the Smiling Scum."" The scum! It suits them well, but I prefer to call a knave a knave. They are smugglers and pirates and thieves to the last filthy cat.\n\nThe Renrijra are swaggering fools. Do you know what the so-called ""code"" of their order is called? ""The Foolish Concepts."" Fools! I have intercepted their logs and records, and I know their ways. They kill without hesitation. They espouse bravery, yet run away when confronted with justice. They curry favor by giving trinkets to the poor. Then they claim to be benefactors when stealing from those of privilege. A thief is still a thief!\n\nSuch insolence! They remind me of that servant we used to employ, the one who deigned to teach you how to dance. Do you remember him? The swarthy fellow who kept trying to meet with you privately? What cheek! Or the gardener who lurked by your bedroom window while I was away? Or the mason who would linger in our salon pretending to work while surreptitiously staring at you? Knaves! The world is full of knaves.\n\nKnow that I do this for more than my need to protect you and yours. I do this to protect our kingdom! I do this to secure our High King's domain by sea! Those knavish cats will never prevail.\n\nForgive me for my digression. My need for justice consumes me. I fear I will be at sea pursuing the Renrijra for several more months, along with the crew of the Wrath of Glenumbra, yet I await the day I shall return to you.\n\nIn answer to your last query: yes, we can afford to hire those workers you requested to build an extension on the house. Make sure they aren't shirking their duties. You'll have to watch them closely!\n\nI've nearly drained my teapot and worn out my welcome with these spiritual lizard-folk, so I must be away. Rest assured, those Renrijra Pirates won't escape the relentless efforts of the Breton Navy.\n\nI remain, as always, your affectionate and loving,\n\n—Captain Augustus Relippe, Commander, The Wrath of Glenumbra"

Her shrill shrieks in the cold night air were like the songs of doves in the zephyrs of summertime. \n\nThe wafting aroma of her charred flesh was like scenting the heavens themselves. When you are finished with your task, I shall come find you in your quarters. We can use the knives tonight, if you'd like.\n\nLove,\n\nFalarel"
