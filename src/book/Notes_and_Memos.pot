I've been impressed with your independence, and I'm proud of the man you've grown to be. \n\nMy father was a soldier. He often complained that I was too ""bookish."" When you were born, I vowed not to treat you that way. \n\nThough I could not bear to watch you march off to war while I was living, you now have my blessing. I sold my books, and I've left you what I hope will be a generous inheritance. Take it and buy yourself a strong sword and a sturdy suit of armor.\n\nFollow your heart, my son, and find your happy destiny.\n\nWith love,\n\nYour father, Frodibert Fontbonne"

There is so much knowledge that is traditionally forbidden by the decrees of those who fear true power and those who wield it.\n\nKnow that there are places beyond Tamriel where the cunning and the wary can go to learn forgotten spells. I speak of the planes of Oblivion. The sea of limitless dimensions contains an endless series of islands. Some are controlled by the mighty Daedric Princes; others are loosely connected to one minor Daedra Lord or another. On these islands, creatures dwell who possess secrets out of time. Some are there of their own volition, but others are banished there for crimes either heinous or imagined.\n\nIf you are reading this, Telbaril, know that I found one such place long ago. Know that it is not far from the city in which you now sit within a tiny cave by the docks. It is called the Crow's Wood.\n\nAnd son, if you decide to follow me, bring all of your cunning with you."

I had lived my whole life working as a stablehand here at Aswala Stables, and as I lay on my deathbed, I realized my mistake. Tamriel is enormous, filled with exciting people and exciting places, all of which, in the dream, I had missed.\n\nAs you know, mother, my friend Najan disappeared several months ago. I did not wish to worry you, so I did not tell you the truth. Najan joined the cult known as the Withered Hand. At the time, I thought him a madman, but he recently returned in the night and told me of his experience. Though there is much grisly work involved, and I know that grandfather, and even you may condemn me for dishonoring myself, a career of raising the dead seems to be very exciting.\n\nNajan says he was taken to Satakalaam for training. They taught him the arts of war, the arts of necromancy, and the many other valuable skills. They have given him a wardrobe full of silken robes, and he says that they have even promised to take him to the city of Wayrest someday. Najan has invited me to join the Hand, and I have decided I cannot pass up this opportunity.\n\nI will always love you mother. I hope you will forgive me. Perhaps once I learn necromancy, I can come back and raise father from the dead!\n\nSamala"

But not every battlefield features opposing troops arrayed in lines, keep walls to knock down, or cavalry to deflect. Some battlefields require a little creativity. \n\nEvery Covenant cohort is accompanied by an elite mage or two. When the circumstances call for it, why not let them make use of a few non-standard techniques?\n\nHere's one recipe sure to throw a defending force for a loop:\n\n— Seek out any local beast races or unwelcome nonsentients in the area.\n\n— Have your mage infiltrate the lair of these lower life forms.\n\n— Overrun the lair through any means necessary and drive out the unwelcome beasts.\n\n— Maintain control of these lairs throughout the invasion, ensuring that the beast races do not return.\n\nIf the past is any judge, the beast races will move from their lairs towards local villages and towns, creating their own localized invasion upon enemy encampments.\n\nMy next missive will discuss uses for local alchemy goods in creating unique—and explosive—concotions."

The Goblins have been using these as centerpieces for their ritual totems. You'll know these totems when you see them: the Welkynd Stone seems to imbue the totems with a red light. \n\nStill, retrieving the shards should be a simple matter. We're dealing with Goblins, not Dwemer. I'm sure the totems are held together with twine and spit. Just rip the shard out. Even your grunts should be able to handle that.\n\n— Gaston"

msgid "My dear Vania,\n\nThe situation has turned grave out here. I can't go into details right now, but know that I am doing everything I can to keep myself safe. I have not been injured, though I have seen some action.\n\nThe Moors and King's Guard are rife with old ruins, tombs, and other ancient places. On my next rest period, I will see if I can find any valuables in one of the nearby ruins. My friend Marroy was telling tales of Cath Bedraud and some old crypt he claims is somewhere nearby. It's called Ebon Crypt or some suitably gloomy name like that. \n\nI plan to return to you with a nice bauble we can sell to create a little nest egg for ourselves. The dead can't do anything with the gold that's buried with them, but we could surely use it. \n\nI'll write again when I can.\n\n— Ambrel"

msgid "I write this to record the fall of Camlorn and ask for our city to be avenged.\n\nI need to write this quickly, as I can hear the foul creatures howling outside my door. I don't know how long the barricade will hold and I want to finish this and hide it before they find me.\n\nSo, how did this all begin? As with most falls, we were betrayed. It was Jonathan Telwin, my one-time friend and companion, who had sworn himself to the service of Angof and the undead monster called Faolchu. Jonathan confided in me. He asked me to join his cause. I dismissed him, thinking this was just another of his many pranks. I was wrong.\n\nFaolchu made Jonathan a shifter, and the first wolf to breach our gates strolled in as though he belonged here. And we let him in, because he did. Once inside, Jonathan spread Faolchu's curse (he called it a gift) throughout the city. The cursed would meet at night, while the city slept, and we mistook the howls in the dark for wild dogs.\n\nAs the numbers of the cursed grew, they opened the gates and let Faolchu and the rest of his mad pack into the city. That was a few hours ago, just after night fell. They ripped apart anyone who tried to oppose them. The blood—there was so much blood! Those they didn't kill they … changed. I watched as my friends and neighbors transformed into wolves. Their screams were a mix of agony and ecstasy, and some dark part of me longed to join them. But I put such thoughts aside and got my family to safety.\n\nWe never would have made it if not for the Camlorn Guard. Captain Darien and a small number of guards attacked the werewolves and defended us as we made our escape. I must say, Captain Darien was magnificent. He seemed immune to each attack, dodging and blocking and laughing as though he was thoroughly enjoying himself. He cleared a path to a house and shouted for a group of civilians to get inside and barricade the doors and windows. We were one of those groups.\n\nI don't know what happened to the Captain and his guards, but I thank them for helping us. I can smell fires now. I think the wolves intend to burn us out.\n\nLet me end this letter by saying that Jonathan Telwin is a coward. He took the easy way out and convinced a certain number of people to join him. I can't forgive the massacre that he took part in. If you're reading this, please, avenge Camlorn. Put an end to Faolchu and his foul creatures. Don't let this injustice go unanswered."

msgid "Uncle,\n\nSorry for the delay in sending you this letter. I know I might not get to deliver it for a while, but I wanted to write to you about Bearclaw Mine right away. It's been a long journey, but I know it's going to be worth it.\n\nWe don't go out of the cave often, of course. There's a reason this place is called Bearclaw Mine. The bears are as fearsome as you'd expect, but that's worked out well for us. It means there isn't any competition here. As long as we're quick and quiet, we can make a lot of coin here very quickly.\n\nThank you again for selling the house. That should buy us more time with the debtors, and we'll be able to settle our accounts soon.\n\nI don't feel good about bringing my family here, but you know how those moneylenders are. I actually feel safer with them here than back there.\n\nMarisse is taking this all rather well. She brought a few books, and she's reading them to Alain. Her lessons are still very religious, but if that is what it takes for her to get through this, that's fine with me.\n\nI hope everything worked out getting the profits to the right people. We'll be back as soon as we've got enough to pay off the rest of the debt.\n\nMay the Divines watch over you. May they guide and protect us all.\n\n— Hu …."
