msgid "An ancient Khajiiti myth as recorded by Moon-Singer Satarri.\n\nIn the time before time, when the sixteen kingdoms roamed with wild abandon, the hero Khunzar-ri gathered champions to deal with a terrible demon and his horde. With Nurarion the Perfect and Flinthild Demon-Hunter, he sought a third companion.\n\nThe demon said, ""Oh, little cat-thing, you amuse us! How can three tiny morsels ever stand against us?"" Khunzar-ri laughed, ""We may be tiny, but we are persistent! And tricky, too, as you will see.""\n\nThen Khunzar-ri turned to his Kra'Jun. ""One more we need, a Khajiiti queen of renown. Anequina Sharp-Tongue, who loves to bask in the glow of the Big Moon when she reflects and thinks deep thoughts.""\n\nThese are the words and the words are true."

msgid "Translation by Jarvus, apprentice to Arkan the Gifted, Daggerfall City, 2E 255\n\nScholars have labored for years to fully translate the scrolls of Baan Dar, vellum parchments found in a series of alabaster jars near Lake Vread in eastern Elsweyr. I myself can make no claims to this translation's authenticity. Reader beware!\n— Yanabir-ja, loyal follower of the Boaster\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBaan Dar, the Legend—thief, warlock, shadowmaster, the Boastful. Mastermind of Nefarious Plots. All these things and more describe the legendary Baan Dar, he who is called the Bandit God. The Exile. The Pariah. But what is the truth?\n\nBaan Dar is a much more simple and complex being. I pen this tale as I slowly die of old age and a mortifying arrow wound. I cannot decide if the truth will add to or subtract from the legend that is Baan Dar, nor if the original Baan Dar would want the truth to be known. Therefore, I will leave this tale hidden when I am done and gone, and let Fate (which was ever Baan Dar's true master and motivator) decide.\n\nI was a child of twelve seasons when I first met Baan Dar. Orphan of a slaver raid during one of the many inter-provincial border wars. Living by my quick wits, nimble fingers, and the grace of Lady Luck in the back alleys and byways of my birth city. I had just ""liberated"" a loaf of bread and a few small apples from a local street vendor in the bazaar on the edge of the city, near the tumbled outer wall. I had withdrawn down an ill-lit alley to feast on my bounty when I was beset upon by an older band of my ilk. The older and lazier variety which were wont to engage in the easier and less dangerous art of stealing from the stealers.\n\nThere were five of the bullies who had decided they were more deserving of my bounty than I, and they were beating me half to death with staves, laughing the whole time. Lying on the ground, curled up into as tight a ball as I could manage, trying to protect my head and groin, I heard a quiet voice ask if they were not ""more suited to go down to the wharf and take food from your brother rats, or would you care to try your tricks on game a bit more your size and number?""\n\nSince my ""companions"" had become otherwise engaged with the newcomer and had for the nonce ceased thumping, kicking, and cuffing at me, I looked up to see a dark shadow of boots, cloak, and chainmail hood leaning against the wall at the end of the alley.\n\nThe others, being what they were, took this as a challenge to their manhood—and easy prey to their superior number with a promise of gold as added reward (else the first part would have been overlooked). The leader of my band of playmates suggested that the stranger take a leap off the aforementioned wharf unless he wished to join me there when they were done with their evening meal.\n\nHaving drawn chuckles and courage from his underlings, he then proceeded forward with staff at high port. I'm not quite sure exactly what followed, but within a short space of time, Lead bully was lying in the dirt with a thrown dagger in his chest, number two bully had lost three teeth to a boot (I still carry them in a leather pouch as a keepsake), and number three bully was brought short by his own staff applied forcefully up between his toes (the two big ones!). Bullies four and five thought better of the entertainment and departed rapidly for parts unknown.\n\nBaan Dar picked me up, dusted me off, and dragged me round to a nearby tavern, where we shared a meal and a mug. I attempted to thank him for saving my life. How can I ever repay this favor, I asked? His reply was short, to the point, and has driven my actions in life ever since. \n\nHe said, ""Never repay a favor, kid. Pass it on to someone else."""

""A Kothringi tribesman who presents his credentials as Lord Zuuk of Black Marsh, part of the Imperial Garrison of Gideon.""\n\n""What makes you think I'd have even the slightest possible interest in seeing him?"" asked the Night Mother with venomous sweetness.\n\n""He brings a letter from the late Empress of the Cyrodilic Empire.""\n\n""We are having a busy day,"" she smiled, clapping her hands together with delight. ""Show him in.""\n\nZuuk entered the chamber. His metallic skin, though exposed only at his face and hands, caught the light of the fireplace and the lightning of the stormy night from the window. The Night Mother noted also that she could see herself as he saw her: serene, beautiful, fear-inspiring. He handed her his letter from the Empress without a word. Sipping her wine, she read it.\n\n""The Duke of Morrowind also offered me an appreciable sum to have the Emperor murdered earlier this year,"" she said, folding the letter. ""His payment sunk, and never was delivered. It was a considerable annoyance, particularly as I had already gone to the trouble of putting one of my agents in the palace. Why should I assume that your more-than-generous payment, from a dead woman, will arrive?""\n\n""I brought it with me,"" said Zuuk simply. ""It is in the carriage outside.""\n\n""Then bring it in and our business is complete,"" smiled the Night Mother. ""The Emperor will be dead by year's end. You may leave the gold with Apaladith. Unless you'd care for some wine?""\n\nZuuk declined the offer and withdrew. The moment he left the room, Miramor slipped noiselessly back from behind the dark tapestry. The Night Mother offered him a glass of wine, and he accepted it.\n\n""I know that fellow, Zuuk,"" said Miramor carefully. ""I didn't know he worked for the old Empress though.""\n\n""Let's talk about you some more, if you don't mind,"" she said, knowing he would, in fact, not mind.\n\n""Let me show you my worth,"" said Miramor. ""Let me be the one to do the Emperor in. I've already killed his son, and you saw there how well I can hide myself away. Tell me you saw one ripple in the tapestry.""\n\nThe Night Mother smiled. Things were falling into place rather nicely.\n\n""If you know how to use a dagger, you will find him at Bodrum,"" she said, and described to him what he must do.\n\n3 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nMournhold, Morrowind\n\nThe Duke stared out the window. It was early morning, and for the fourth straight day, a red mist hung over the city, flashing lightning. A freakish wind blew through the streets, ripping his flags from the castle battlements, forcing all his people to close their shutters tightly. Something terrible was coming to his land. He was not a greatly learned man, but he knew the signs. So too did his subjects.\n\n""When will my messengers reach the Three?"" he growled, turning to his castellan.\n\n""Vivec is far to the north, negotiating the treaty with the Emperor,"" the man said, his face and voice trembling with fear. ""Almalexia and Sotha Sil are in Necrom. Perhaps they can be reached in a few days time.""\n\nThe Duke nodded. He knew his messengers were fast, but so too was the hand of Oblivion."

msgid "The thief waited in the darkest corner of the common room, watching. Few paid heed to him; a petty noble made eye contact with him for a moment, but he was not the man the thief was seeking. After a time, a man dressed as an unobtrusive merchant approached the thief and slipped him a rolled sheet of parchment. With easy grace he slipped the parchment up his shirtsleeve, and with a slight nod to the man he left the tavern. \n\nBy the light of Secunda he unrolled the scroll and looked it over. On the yellowing page was sketched the floor plan of a sturdy tower, showing all of the entrances and exits as well as marking the location of his target, a small chest hidden on the highest level of the tower. As he strolled out of town a lady of the evening called to him, but he had other treasures on his mind.\n\nThe tower stood tall and dark, looming grimly above the surrounding trees. It did not take the thief long to scale the outside of the tower, to one of the upper windows that he intended to use as his means of entrance. He slipped easily through the window and crouched there for a moment in the darkness, listening. Then suddenly the entire room was alight with fire—bolts of flame streaming directly at him. ""Sheogorath's teeth!"" he cursed as he dodged to the side, narrowly avoiding the bolts of fire. He hadn't been expecting a mage."

msgid "2920: The Last Year of the First Era\n\nBy Carlovac Townway\n\n29 Frostfall, 2920\nPhrygias, High Rock\n\nPale sunlight flickered behind the mist bathing the forest as Turala, Doryatha, and Celephyna drove their horses on. The ground was wet with a thin layer of frost, and laden down with goods, it was a slippery way over unpaved hills. Turala tried to contain her excitement about coming back to the coven. Wayrest had been an adventure, and she adored the looks of fear and respect the cityfolk gave her. But for the last few days, all she could think of was returning to her sisters and her child.\n\nA bitter wind whipped her hair forward so she could see nothing but the path ahead. She did not hear the rider approach to her side until he was almost upon her. When she turned and saw Cassyr, she shouted with as much surprise as pleasure at meeting an old friend. His face was pale and drawn, but she took it to be merely from travel.\n\n""What brings you back to Phrygias?"" she smiled. ""Were you not treated well in Dwynnen?""\n\n""Well enough,"" said Cassyr. ""I have need of the Skeffington coven.""\n\n""Ride with us,"" said Turala. ""I'll bring you to Mynistera.""\n\nThe four continued on, and the witches regaled Cassyr with tales of Wayrest. It was evident that it was also a rare treat for Doryatha and Celephyna to leave Old Barbyn's Farm. They had been born there, as daughters and grand-daughters of Skeffington witches. Ordinary High Rock city life was exotic to them as it was to Turala. Cassyr said little, but smiled and nodded his head, which was encouragement enough. Thankfully, none of the stories they had heard were about his own stupidity. Or at the very least, they did not tell him.\n\nDoryatha was in the midst of a tale she had heard in a tavern about a thief who had been locked overnight in a pawnshop when they crossed over a familiar hill. Suddenly, she halted in her story. The barn was supposed to be visible, but it was not. The other three followed her gaze into the fog, and a moment later, they rode as fast as they could towards what was once the site of the Skeffington coven.\n\nThe fire had long since burned out. Nothing but ashes, skeletons, and broken weaponry remained. Cassyr recognized at once the signs of an Orc raid.\n\nThe witches fell from their horses, racing through the remains, wailing. Celephyna found a tattered, bloody piece of cloth that she recognized from Mynistera's cloak. She held it to her ashen face, sobbing. Turala screamed for Bosriel, but the only reply was the high whistling wind through the ashes.\n\n""Who did this?"" she cried, tears streaking down her face. ""I swear I'll conjure up the very flames of Oblivion! What have they done with my baby?""\n\n""I know who did it,"" said Cassyr quietly, dropping from his horse and walking towards her. ""I've seen these weapons before. I fear I met the very fiends responsible in Dwynnen, but I never thought they'd find you. This is the work of assassins hired by the Duke of Mournhold.""\n\nHe paused. The lie came easily. Adopt and improvise. What's more, he could tell instantly that she believed it. Her resentment over the cruelty the Duke had shown her had quieted, but never disappeared. One look at her burning eyes told him that she would summon the Daedra and wreak his, and her, revenge upon Morrowind. And what's more, he knew they'd listen.\n\nAnd listen they did. For the power that is greater than desire is rage. Even rage misplaced."

At the end of most Lovers' Days he was in an excellent mood, dancing in the ballroom with all the guests, but tonight he retired early. When she found him, he was curled in the bed, frowning.\n\n""That blasted bard's tale about Polydor and Eloisa put me in a rotten state,"" he growled. ""Why did he have to be so depressing?""\n\n""But isn't that the truth of the tale, my dear? Weren't they doomed because of the cruel nature of the world?""\n\n""It doesn't matter what the truth is, he did a rotten job of telling a rotten tale, and I'm not going to let him do it anymore,"" King Dro'Zel sprang from the bed. His eyes were rheumy with tears. ""Where did they say he was from again?""\n\n""I believe Gilverdale in easternmost Valenwood,"" said the Queen, shaken. ""My husband, what are you going to do?""\n\nDro'Zel was out of the room in a single spring, bounding up the stairs to his tower. If Queen Hasaama knew what her husband was going to do, she did not try to stop him. He had been erratic of late, prone to fits and even occasional seizures. But she never suspected the depths of his madness, and his loathing for the bard and his tale of the wickedness and perversity found in mortal man.\n\n19 Sun's Dawn, 2920\nGilverdale, Valenwood\n\n""Listen to me again,"" said the old carpenter. ""If cell three holds worthless brass, then cell two holds the gold key. If cell one holds the gold key, then cell three hold worthless brass. If cell two holds worthless brass, then cell one holds the gold key.""\n\n""I understand,"" said the lady. ""You told me. And so cell one holds the gold key, right?""\n\n""No,"" said the carpenter. ""Let me start from the top.""\n\n""Mama?"" said the little boy, pulling on his mother's sleeve.\n\n""Just one moment, dear, mother's talking,"" she said, concentrating on the riddle. ""You said 'cell three holds the golden key if cell two holds worthless brass,' right?""\n\n""No,"" said the carpenter patiently. ""Cell three holds worthless brass, if cell two—""\n\n""Mama!"" cried the boy. His mother finally looked.\n\nA bright red mist was pouring over the town in a wave, engulfing building after building in its wake. Striding before was a red-skinned giant. The Daedra Molag Bal. He was smiling.\n\n29 Sun's Dawn, 2920\nGilverdale, Valenwood\n\nAlmalexia stopped her steed in the vast moor of mud to let him drink from the river. He refused to, even seemed repelled by the water. It struck her as odd: they had been making excellent time from Mournhold, and surely he must be thirsty. She dismounted and joined her retinue.\n\n""Where are we now?"" she asked.\n\nOne of her ladies pulled out a map. ""I thought we were approaching a town called Gilverdale.""\n\nAlmalexia closed her eyes and opened them again quickly. The vision was too much to bear. As her followers watched, she picked up a piece of brick and a fragment of bone, and clutched them to her heart.\n\n""We must continue on to Artaeum,"" she said quietly."

All three wished that the circumstances of their reunion were different.\n\n""From what we've learned, while the Prince was returning to Cyrodiil to the south, a second Imperial Army came down from the north,"" said Vivec to his stony-faced compatriots. ""It is reasonable to assume Juilek didn't know about the attack.""\n\n""But neither would it be unreasonable to suppose that he planned on being a distraction while the Emperor launched the attack on Black Gate,"" said Sotha Sil. ""This must be considered a breach of the truce.""\n\n""Where is the Duke of Mournhold?"" asked Vivec. ""I would hear his thoughts on the matter.""\n\n""He is meeting with the Night Mother in Tel Aruhn,"" said Almalexia, quietly. ""I told him to wait until he had spoken with you, but he said that the matter had waited long enough.""\n\n""He would involve the Morag Tong? In outside affairs?""

This matter must be settled with diplomacy or battle.""\n\n25 Sun's Height, 2920\nTel Aruhn, Morrowind\n\nThe Night Mother met Sotha Sil in her salon, lit only by the moon. She was cruelly beautiful, dressed in a simple silk black robe and lounging across her divan. With a gesture, she dismissed her red-cloaked guards and offered the sorcerer some wine.\n\n""You've only just missed your friend, the Duke,"" she whispered. ""He was very unhappy, but I think we will solve his problem for him.""\n\n""Did he hire the Morag Tong to assassinate the Emperor?"" asked Sotha Sil.\n\n""You are straightforward, aren't you? That's good. I love plain-speaking men: it saves so much time. Of course, I cannot discuss with you what the Duke and I talked about,"" she smiled. ""It would be bad for business.""\n\n""What if I were to offer you an equal amount of gold for you not to assassinate the Emperor?""\n\n""The Morag Tong murders for the glory of Mephala and for profit,"" she said, speaking into her glass of wine. ""We do not merely kill. That would be sacrilege. Once the Duke's gold has arrived in three day's time, we will do our end of the business. And I'm afraid we would not dream of entertaining a counter offer. Though we are a business as well as a religious order, we do not bow to supply and demand, Sotha Sil.""\n\n27 Sun's Height, 2920\nThe Inner Sea, Morrowind\n\nSotha Sil had been watching the waters for two days now, waiting for a particular vessel, and now he saw it. A heavy ship with the flag of Mournhold. The sorcerer took the air and intercepted it before it reached harbor. A caul of flame erupted over his figure, disguising his voice and form into that of a Daedra.\n\n""Abandon your ship!"" he bellowed. ""If you would not sink with it!""\n\nIn truth, Sotha Sil could have exploded the vessel with but a single ball of fire, but he chose to take his time, to give the crew a chance to dive off into the warm water. When he was certain there was no one living aboard, he focused his energy into a destructive wave that shook the air and water as it discharged. The ship and the Duke's payment to the Morag Tong sunk to the bottom of the Inner Sea.\n\n""Night Mother,"" thought Sotha Sil, as he floated towards shore to alert the harbormaster that some sailors were in need of rescue. ""Everyone bows to supply and demand."""

""You must believe me, I knew nothing about the attack on Black Gate until after it happened. We will, of course, be returning it to your care forthwith. I wrote you a letter to that effect at your palace in Balmora, but obviously you're not there,"" he paused, taking in the many new faces in the room. ""I'm sorry, let me introduce myself. I'm Juilek Cyrodiil.""\n\n""My name is Almalexia,"" said the most beautiful woman the Prince had ever seen. ""Won't you join us?""\n\n""Sotha Sil,"" said a serious-looking Dunmer in a white cloak, shaking the Prince's hand and showing him to a seat.\n\n""Indoril Brindisi Dorom, Duke-Prince of Mournhold,"" said the massively built man next to him as he sat down.\n\n""I recognize that the events of the last month suggest, at best, that the Imperial Army is not under my control,"" said the Prince after ordering some wine. ""This is true. The army is my father's.""\n\n""I understood that the Emperor was going to be coming to Ald Lambasi as well,"" said Almalexia.\n\n""Officially, he is,"" said the Prince cautiously. ""Unofficially, he's still back in the Imperial City. He's met with an unfortunate accident.""\n\nVivec glanced at the Duke quickly before looking at the Prince. ""An accident?""\n\n""He's fine,"" said the Prince quickly. ""He'll live, but it looks like he'll lose an eye. It was an altercation that has nothing to do with the war. The only good news is that while he recovers, I have the use of his seal. Any agreement we make here and now will be binding to the Empire, both in my father's reign and in mine.""\n\n""Then let's start agreeing,"" smiled Almalexia."

msgid "By Alchemist Aleeto\n\nI confess it. I'm an alchemist. I love to mix things together to see what happens. The mystery and magic of the alchemical process fascinates me. On the one hand, it's acutely precise, with weights and measures that must be painstakingly adhered to. On the other hand, it's wildly impromptu, with plenty of room for spontaneity and impulsiveness. Indeed, some of the biggest alchemical breakthroughs must be attributed to aggressive leaps of faith and logic.\n\nAnd I confess: I love adventure. I like to explore caves and dark swamps in search of alchemical reagents, and I enjoy experimenting with mixtures and concoctions until something explodes. In fact, the more risky or unexpected the undertaking, the more I enjoy the experience. I find such exploits … exhilarating!\n\nDoes this juxtaposition make me special? Brave? Just plain strange? I'm certainly not a frail, scholarly professor, hidden away in my secret laboratory and toiling away at my experiments. But you be the judge. Let me tell you about one of my recent adventures. It happened exactly as I shall describe. More or less.\n\nI was deep in the wilds of Eastmarch, looking for Old Sord's Cave, when a customer entered my alchemy shop. \n\nBlast it! An actual customer!

Searching for any sign of its owner, he spied a wide-brimmed bonnet where it lay abandoned on the ground. As he stood there wondering, the bright yellow flame of the tiny lantern flickered, then guttered out.\n\nHe looked to his own lantern, bobbing happily in the water above his shoulders, and took another step only to find he couldn't. Indeed, he could barely shift his waist, so thick was the muck he'd mired in.\n\nLooking skyward, he reached for the grasping, wooden fingers of the trees above, only to find them beyond his grasp.\n\nSo he stood there, in the dark, until the murky waters swallowed his throat, his mouth, and his funny white cap.

msgid "Retold by Rogar Cliffside, Talespinner\n\nSurely you've heard the legend of Haman Forgefire? Crafter to kings, manipulator of metals, Forgefire was known as the greatest blacksmith in all the land. Jarls, thanes, and anyone who could afford the exorbitant prices he commanded sought out Forgefire to create a precious dagger, a sturdy shield, a mighty warhammer, or a suit of finely wrought armor. After a time, Forgefire had to limit the number of commissions he accepted for any given period, as he refused to take on so much that the work would suffer.\n\nOther blacksmiths claimed that Forgefire could speak to the ore and charm the impurities away with a wink and a whisper. Most revered the man and were in awe of his skills. A few, however, were jealous of Forgefire's accomplishments. They tried to poison opinions against him, claiming that his methods involved nothing short of magic, and foul magic at that—Daedric magic. Chief among the outspoken smiths was the armorer, Gerhild Coldheart.\n\nColdheart was loud and vocal of her distrust of Forgefire and his methods. She wondered aloud, in whatever crowded and boisterous tavern she happened to be drinking in, what vile Daedric Prince the proud and boastful Haman Forgefire had pledged himself to in order to accomplish his miracles with metal. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Forgefire was simply brilliant. But that didn't stop Coldheart from spreading her rumors at each and every opportunity. Soon, her hatred of Forgefire was almost all-consuming and it began to affect her work, which had been impressive in its own right until it began to suffer as her jealousy grew.\n\nForgefire did his best to ignore the increasingly wilder tales, but commissions were becoming harder and harder to come by as Coldheart's rumors circulated. Haman couldn't understand why she insisted on saying such false and terrible things. He soldiered on as best he could, however, taking what work still came his way and praying that something would happen to reverse the downward spiral his fortunes seemed to be caught in. That's when the greatest commission of Haman's career appeared on his doorstep.\n\nThe mighty hero, Kvenel the Tongue, was in the market for a new weapon. And not just any weapon. It had to be a weapon of excellent quality, something to match his beloved sword, Eduj. For his next adventure, Kvenel wanted a hand axe. And he wanted it crafted by the legendary blacksmith, Haman Forgefire. Delighted at this opportunity and excited by the challenge, Haman began to work on his most spectacular piece ever—the hand axe Okin.\n\nGerhild Coldheart, meanwhile, was furious. She had petitioned for the commission to craft Kvenel the Tongue's new weapon. And again, despite her best efforts, Haman was chosen instead of her. Enraged, she did the only thing she could think of. Coldheart embraced the very stories she had been telling about Forgefire and prayed to a Daedric Prince for aid and assistance. She prayed to Molag Bal.\n\nFor five days and five nights, Coldheart remained at her own forge, begging Molag Bal to answer her prayers. On the morning of the sixth day, the Lord of Brutality answered her call. But it was never a simple matter to ask a Daedric Prince for a favor. Molag Bal, especially, requires that a cost must always be paid. For Gerhild Coldheart, that cost had to be paid in blood. ""Kill the smith with a blade crafted by your own hand,"" Molag Bal promised, ""and I shall make you more famous than Forgefire could ever hope to be.""\n\nHaman Forgefire completed Okin, and it was spectacular. He delivered it to Kvenel just in time for his next journey. When Haman returned to his smithy, he saw Coldheart standing before his furnace, silhouetted in the glow of the fire. ""Did you enjoy the adoration of the great Nord hero, Haman?"" Coldheart asked. ""I do hope so. For it is the last honor you will receive in this life.""\n\nColdheart spun and plunged her sword into Forgefire's heart. The master smith stumbled, falling into the intense fire burning in his own furnace. His body, engulfed in flames, burned for three days and was not consumed. During that time, Coldheart screamed that she could hear Forgefire's cries of pain no matter how far she ran. Kvenel proclaimed that Gerhild Coldheart was the worst villain of the age and brought her before the Thane of Windhelm to be executed for her crime. For that one moment, she had indeed become more famous than Haman Forgefire.\n\nWhen Coldheart's head was separated from her body, Forgefire—smithy and all—disappeared from Tamriel. To this very day, it is said that Haman Forgefire stalks the shadows of Coldharbour, seeking to finally get revenge against the jealous and traitorous Gerhild Coldheart. And anyone else who happens to get in his way."

As with most legends that start like this, the good times didn't last. \n\nFor Thane Icehammer, the change began when he returned from an extended hunting trip to the Yorgrim River basin. He was no longer cheerful and loud, but had inexplicitly become dour and short-tempered. And as the months went by, his mood only became more foul and his temper more dark.\n\n""What has caused such change in my husband?"" Matron Icehammer demanded, and she turned to the Keepers of Kynesgrove for advice and assistance. \n\nThe Keepers sent a young acolyte to investigate the situation. She spent a day and a night with Thane Icehammer, observing his actions, asking him questions, and trying to ascertain what had happened to make the Thane become so bitter and angry. \n\nFinally, after many long hours together, the acolyte noticed a dark stain spreading from Thane Icehammer's side and across his tunic. She ripped away his shirt. A festering wound that would not heal was carved into his side, the glowing tip of a spear jutting from it. ""He said his name was Hircine,"" the Thane wailed. ""He said I should never have hunted the were-creatures, but how was I supposed to know what they were?""\n\nThen, his anger overcoming him, Thane Icehammer struck out and killed Kyne's acolyte. Devastated by her husband's actions, Matron Icehammer ordered the Cragwallow Watch to subdue the Thane. He fled, however, and they chased him to the ancient burial vault beneath the nearby mountains. The Watch, prepared to enter the vault after him, were called back by the Matron. ""No,"" she said sadly, ""I won't risk more lives to save a monster. Seal the vault."" \n\nAnd with that, Thane Icehammer was entombed—wounded by a Daedric Prince, but still alive. \n\nThey say Thane Icehammer still stalks the chambers of the vault, fueled by an unending rage and the magic of Hircine's spear."

Gadof had been set upon by bandits on the road to Whiterun Hold, and he was outnumbered seven to one. A Stormfist through and through, Gadof made a good showing, but his hammer couldn't be everywhere at once. He had taken down two of the bandits, but he had been wounded in the process and his blood was flowing freely.\n\nThat's when Fildgor Strong-Prince appeared. He leaped into the middle of the remaining bandits, scattering them with a series of powerful blows. He fought his way to Gadof's side and set his broad back against my brother's. They defeated the bandits, and Fildgor carried my brother home. Our younger brother, Braxek, rushed to help. When they learned who Fildgor was, they both pledged their lives and their honor to the strong and charismatic prince.\n\nI was only a girl at the time, but from the moment I saw him, I knew that I was in love with the stranger from the east. Fildgor stayed at our house, helping out while Gadof recovered from his wounds. They talked often, and that's where the idea for the Stormfist Brigade was first born. Fildgor imagined a group of boon companions, traveling the land and righting wrongs. He was so idealistic! And he talked about Queen Mabjaarn with such love and admiration.\n\nWhen the group of twelve finally came together, drawn from the strongest and bravest of the Stormfist clan, a great feast was thrown to send them off in style. The party lasted for three days, and on the morning of the forth day, the Stormfist Brigade rode out. Determined to be a part of that special group, I took up my hammer and followed them. When they were in the thick of their first battle, pitted against a Goblin raiding party, I jumped in to help. Just as Fildgor Strong-Prince had done when my brother needed him.\n\nIt was a wonderful battle and a grand victory! The first of many for the Brigade. But my brothers were furious with me. They said I was too young to be on the road with them. Fildgor, however, simply smiled. ""She fought well,"" he said. ""And she loves me. What other requirement is there for membership in our band? Besides, thirteen is a much better number than twelve.""\n\nI stayed at Fildgor's side through the battles of the Akaviri war. I was there to comfort him when he lost the throne to his skeever of a brother, Jorunn. And I followed him into exile, where I watched him build an army out of thin air and rally the Orcs of the far reaches. Now we're back, and this time I'll be there to watch my beloved Fildgor finally claim the throne that is rightfully his. Even if it does mean hiding in caves until the time is right to make our move.\n\nAnd as far as caves go, this one isn't half bad."

msgid "by Telenger the Artificer\n\nRecently I attended a stage production called ""The Lusty Argonian Maid."" Bawdy, delightful, and filled with innuendo, I am surprised it was never presented in this form before.\n\nAccording to my research, ""The Lusty Argonian Maid"" has its origins in a long line of tales told by traveling bards, each with a slightly different title and premise, but the same end result: a female innocent succumbs to the charms of a dominant, married male character.\n\nIn the south, the tale was occasionally presented as ""The Lusty Bosmeri,"" and ""Two Moons for Sugar."" I've also heard ""Shornhelm's Lusty Orifice,"" ""The Sandy Spear of Alik'r,"" and ""The Maiden's Tight Hold"" in taverns across the north and northwest.\n\nIn a stage play, each of the character archetypes is brought to life before the audience. Unless the acting is superb, the subject matter can come off flat and uninspired. Also, a play takes away from the verbal dexterity exhibited by a bard such as the legendary Khajiit, Tale-Singer. The feline bard described the various ploys used by the man to bring the maiden to her knees in a way that made one's pulse race and breath quicken, wondering what would come next.\n\nIndeed, much of the ""Argonian Maid"" borrows heavily from Tale-Singer's songs (uncredited, but naturally I recognized them immediately), in which the maiden helps the male with a spear, a loaf of bread, and a spilt flask of coconut milk.\n\nFortunately, the players in the current production of ""The Lusty Argonian Maid"" are excellent, bringing this age-old tale to new heights. The reference to the Spear of the Hunter would bring laughter to the most sullen. And the wheel of cheese … well, I've never seen this variant before, but it was truly inspired!\n\nI foresee this play will outlive its humble beginnings as a fireside amusement to become a choice bit of frivolous entertainment for generations to come."

He made his original pile as a prospector, opening a series of profitable mines throughout the Velothi Mountains. As the Stormcrag fortune and holdings grew, Ragnor invested in related businesses, including shipping, armor and weapon crafting, banking, and jewelry making. \n\nAs his long and successful life neared its end, Ragnor began a project to turn one of his mines into a crypt for his family. He didn't live to see the completion of the grand burial chambers, but he was interred in the deepest vault when the crypt was completed by his son, Agemor.\n\nThe Stormcrag family has produced business moguls, generals, priests, wizards, thanes, and other prominent individuals in every generation. Most were given a place of honor and reverence within the family crypt when their time came. Some lived long lives and died of natural causes, others fell much too soon, either to illness, accident, or battle. Then there was Sorga Stormcrag.\n\nSorga was a wizard, a member of the Mages Guild, who became obsessed with the accumulation of arcane power. When study and training failed to provide the power she sought, Sorga began to turn to more desperate measures. Some of these, the rumors reported, involved Daedra.\n\nWhen the family matriarch of the time, Koralla, heard about the dark path her niece had started down, she was furious. ""Nords do not deal with Daedra,"" she proclaimed. But Koralla's efforts to change Sorga's plans fell on deaf ears. Worse, the family began to hear tales of dark magic and murder associated with Sorga Stormcrag. That was all Koralla needed to hear.\n\nKoralla disowned Sorga, casting her out of the family and cutting off her access to the family fortune and her inheritance. She also declared that the family crypt would never hold the body of a Daedra-loving Nord. \n\n""If the family crypt is off limits to me, then no Stormcrag will ever rest there again!"" Sorga declared. She placed a curse upon the tomb, making the dead rise and setting a deathknight loose within the silent depths.\n\nTo this day, the curse remains in place, and no Stormcrags have been interred in the crypt since Sorga was disowned."

msgid "By Rolard Nordssen\n\nWith the acclamations of the Fellows of the Imperial Society still ringing in my ears, I decided to return to Morrowind immediately. It was not without some regret that I bade farewell to the fleshpots of the Imperial City, but I knew that the wonders I had brought back from Raled-Makai had only scratched the surface of the Dwemer ruins in Morrowind. Even more spectacular treasures were out there, I felt, just waiting to be found, and I was eager to be off. I also had before me the salutary example of poor Bannerman, who was still dining out on his single expedition to Black Marsh twenty years ago. That would never be me, I vowed.\n\nWith my letter from the Empress in hand, this time I would have the full cooperation of the Imperial authorities. No more need to worry about attacks from superstitious locals. But where should I look next? The ruins at Kemel-Ze were the obvious choice. Unlike Raled-Makai, getting to the ruins would not be a problem. Also known as the ""Cliff City,"" Kemel-Ze lies on the mainland side of the Vvardenfell Rift, sprawling down the sheer coastal cliff. Travelers from the east coast of Vvardenfell often visit the site by boat, and it can also be reached overland from the nearby villages without undue hardship.\n\nOnce my expedition had assembled in Seyda Neen, with the usual tedious complications involved in operating in this half-civilized land, we set out for the village of Marog near the ruins, where we hoped to hire a party of diggers. My interpreter, Tuen Panai, an unusually jolly fellow for a Dark Elf whom I had hired in Seyda Neen at the recommendation of the local garrison commander, assured me that the local villagers would be very familiar with Kemel-Ze, having looted the site for generations. Incidentally, Ten Penny (as we soon came to call him, to his constant amusement) proved invaluable and I would recommend him without hesitation to any of my colleagues who were planning similar expeditions to the wilds of Morrowind.\n\nAt Marog, we ran into our first trouble. The hetman of the village, a reserved, elegant old fellow, seemed willing to cooperate, but the local priest (a representative of the absurd religion they have here, worshiping something called the Tribunal who they claim actually live in palaces in Morrowind) was fervently against us excavating the ruins. He looked likely to sway the villagers to his side with his talk of ""religious taboos,"" but I waved the Empress's letter under his nose and mentioned something about my friend the garrison commander at Seyda Neen and he quieted right down. No doubt this was just a standard negotiating tactic arranged among the villagers to increase their pay. In any event, once the priest had stalked off muttering to himself, no doubt calling down curses upon the heads of the foreign devils, we soon had a line of villagers eager to sign on to the expedition.\n\nWhile my assistant was working out the mundane details of contracts, supplies, etc., Master Arum and I rode on to the ruins. By land, they can only be reached using narrow paths that wind down the face of the cliff from above, where any misstep threatens to send one tumbling into the sea foaming about the jagged rocks below. The city's original entrance to the surface must have been in the part of the city to the northeast—the part that fell into the sea long ago when an eruption of Red Mountain created this mind-bogglingly vast crater. After successfully navigating the treacherous path, we found ourselves in a large chamber, open to the sky on one side, disappearing into the darkness on the other. As we stepped forward, our boots crunched on piles of broken metal, as common in Dwarven ruins as potsherds in other ancient sites. This was obviously where the looters brought their finds from deeper levels, stripping off the valuable outer casings of the Dwarven mechanisms and leaving their innards here—easier than lugging the intact mechanisms back up to the top of the cliff. I laughed to myself, thinking of the many warriors unwittingly walking around Tamriel with pieces of Dwarven mechanisms on their backs. For that, of course, is what most ""Dwarven armor"" really is—just the armored shells of ancient mechanical men. I sobered when I thought of how exceedingly valuable an intact mechanism would be. This place was obviously full of Dwarven devices, judging from the litter covering the floor of this vast chamber—or had been, I reminded myself. Looters had been working over this site for centuries. Just the casing alone would be worth a small fortune, sold as armor. Most Dwarven armor is made of mismatched pieces from various devices, hence its reputation for being bulky and unwieldy. But a matched set from an intact mechanism is worth more than its weight in gold, for the pieces all fit together smoothly and the wearer hardly notices the bulk. Of course, I had no intention of destroying my finds for armor, no matter how valuable. I would bring it back to the Society for scientific study. I imagined the astonished cries of my colleagues as I unveiled it at my next lecture, and smiled again."

I wondered what secrets remained hidden in the maze of chambers that lay before me, defying the efforts of looters, waiting to gleam again in the light they had not seen in long eons. Waiting for me. It remained only to find them! With an impatient gesture to Master Arum to follow, I strode forward into the gloom.\n\nMaster Arum, Ten Penny and I spent several days exploring the ruins while my assistants set up camp at the top of the cliff and hauled supplies and equipment from the village. I was looking for a promising area to begin excavation - a blocked passage or corridor untouched by looters that might lead to completely untouched areas of the ruins.\n\nWe found two such areas early on, but soon discovered that the many winding passages bypassed the blockage and gave access to the rooms behind. Nevertheless, even these outer areas, for the most part stripped clean of artifacts by generations of looters, were full of interest to the professional archaeologist. Behind a massive bronze door, burst from its hinges by some ancient turmoil of the earth, we discovered a large chamber filled with exquisite wall-carvings, which impressed even the jaded Ten Penny, who claimed to have explored every Dwarven ruin in Morrowind. They seemed to depict an ancient ritual of some kind, with a long line of classically-bearded Dwarven elders processing down the side walls, all seemingly bowing to the giant form of a god carved into the front wall of the chamber, which was caught in the act of stepping forth from the crater of a mountain in a cloud of smoke or steam. According to Master Arum, there are no known depictions of Dwarven religious rituals, so this was an exciting find indeed. I set a team to work prying the carved panels from the wall, but they were unable to even crack the surface. On closer examination the chamber appeared to be faced with a metallic substance with the texture and feel of stone, impervious to any of our tools. I considered having Master Arum try his blasting magic on the walls, but decided that the risk of destroying the carvings was too great. Much as I would have preferred to bring them back to the Imperial City, I had to settle for taking rubbings of the carvings. If my colleagues in the Society showed enough interest, I was sure a specialist could be found, perhaps a master alchemist, who could find a way to safely remove the panels.\n\nI found another curious room at the top of a long winding stair, barely passable due to the fall of rubble from the roof. At the top of the stair was a domed chamber with a large ruined mechanism at its center. Painted constellations were still visible in some places on the surface of the dome. Master Arum and I agreed that this must have been some kind of observatory, and the mechanism was therefore the remains of a Dwarven telescope. To remove it from ruins down the narrow stairway would require its complete disassembly (which fact no doubt had preserved it from the attention of looters), so I decided to leave it in place for the time being. The existence of this observatory suggested, however, that this room had once been above the surface. Closer examination of the structure revealed that this was indeed a building, not an excavated chamber. The only other doorways from the room were completely blocked, and careful measurements from the top of the cliff to the entry room and then to the observatory revealed that we were still more than 250 feet below the present ground level. A sobering reminder of the forgotten fury of Red Mountain.\n\nThis discovery led us to focus our attentions downward. Since we now knew approximately where the ancient surface lay, we could rule out many of the higher blocked passages. One wide passage, impressively flanked with carven pillars, particularly drew my interest. It ended in a massive rockfall, but we could see where looters had begun and then abandoned a tunnel through this debris. With my team of diggers and Master Arum's magery to assist, I believed we could succeed where our predecessors had failed. I therefore set my team of Dark Elves to work on clearing the passage, relieved finally to be beginning the real exploration of Kemel-Ze. Soon, I hoped, my boots would be stirring up dust that had lain undisturbed since the dawn of time.\n\nWith this exciting prospect before me, I may have driven my diggers a bit too hard. Ten Penny reported that they were beginning to grumble about the long days, and that some were talking of quitting. Knowing from experience that nothing puts heart back into these Dark Elves like a taste of the lash, I had the ringleaders whipped and the rest confined to the ruins until they had finished clearing the passageway. Thank Stendarr for my foresight in requisitioning a few legionnaires from Seyda Neen! They were sullen at first, but with the promise of an extra day's wages when they broke through, they soon set to work with a will. While these measures may sound harsh to my readers back in the comforts of civilization, let me assure you that there is no other way to get these people to stick to a task."

msgid "By Rolard Nordssen\n\nThe blockage was much worse than I had first thought, and in the end it took almost two weeks to clear the passage. The diggers were as excited as I was when their picks finally broke through the far end into emptiness, and we shared a round of the local liquor together (a foul concoction, in truth) to show that all was forgiven. I could hardly restrain my eagerness as they enlarged the hole to allow entry into the chamber beyond. Would the passage lead to entire new levels of the ancient city, filled with artifacts left by the vanished Dwarves? Or would it be only a dead end, some side passage leading nowhere? My excitement grew as I slid through the hole and crouched for a moment in the darkness beyond. From the echoing sounds of the stones rattling beneath my feet, I was in a large room. Perhaps very large. I stood up carefully, and unhooded my lantern. As the light flooded the chamber, I looked around in astonishment. Here were wonders beyond even my wildest dreams!\n\nAs the light from my lamp filled the chamber beyond the rock fall, I looked around in astonishment. Everywhere was the warm glitter of Dwarven alloys. I had found an untouched section of the ancient city! My heart pounding with excitement, I looked around me. The room was vast, the roof soaring up into darkness beyond the reach of my lamp, the far end lost in shadows with only a tantalizing glimmer hinting at treasures not yet revealed. Along each wall stood rows of mechanical men, intact except for one oddity: their heads had been ritually removed and placed on the floor at their feet. This could mean only one thing - I had discovered the tomb of a great Dwarven noble, maybe even a king! Burials of this type had been discovered before, most famously by Ransom's expedition to Hammerfell, but no completely intact tomb had ever been found. Until now.\n\nBut if this was truly a royal burial, where was the tomb? I stepped forward gingerly, the rows of headless bodies standing silently as they had for eons, their disembodied eyes seeming to watch me as I passed. I had heard wild tales of the Curse of the Dwarves, but had always laughed it off as superstition. But now, breathing the same air as the mysterious builders of this city, which had lain undisturbed since the cataclysm that spelled their doom, I felt a twinge of fear. There was some power here, I felt, something malevolent that resented my presence. I stopped for a moment and listened. All was silent.\n\nExcept … it seemed I heard a faint hiss, regular as breathing. I fought down a sudden surge of panic. I was unarmed, not thinking of danger in my haste to explore past the blocked passage. Sweat dripped down my face as I scanned the gloom for any movement. The room was warm, I suddenly noticed, much warmer than the rest of the labyrinth thus far. My excitement returned. Could I have found a section of the city still connected to a functioning steam grid? Pipes ran along the walls, as in all sections of the city. I walked over and placed my hand on one. It was hot, almost too hot to touch! Now I saw that in places where the ancient piping had corroded, small jets of steam were escaping - the sound I had heard. I laughed at my own credulity.\n\nI now advanced quickly to the far end of the room, giving a cheerful salute to the ranks of mechanical soldiers who had appeared so menacing only moments before. I smiled with triumph as the light swept back the darkness of centuries to reveal the giant effigy of a Dwarven king standing on a raised dais, his metal hand clutching his rod of office. This was the prize indeed! I circled the dais slowly, admiring the craftsmanship of the ancient Dwarves. The golden king stood twenty feet tall under a freestanding domed cupola, his long upswept beard jutting forward proudly as his glittering metal eyes seemed to follow me. But my superstitious mood had passed, and I gazed benevolently on the old Dwarven king. My king, as I had already begun to think of him. I stepped onto the dais to get a better look at the sculpted armor. Suddenly the eyes of the figure opened and it raised a mailed fist to strike!\n\nI leaped to one side as the golden arm came crashing down, striking sparks from the steps where I had stood a moment before. With a hiss of steam and the whir of gears, the giant figure stepped ponderously out from under its canopy and strode towards me with frightening speed, its eyes tracking me as I scrambled backwards. I dodged behind a pillar as the fist whistled down again. I had dropped my lantern in the confusion, and now I crept into the darkness outside the pool of light, hoping to slip between the headless mechanisms and thus escape back to the safety of the passageway. Where had the monster gone? You would think that a twenty-foot golden king would be hard to miss, but he was nowhere to be seen. The guttering lamp only illuminated a small part of the room. He could be hiding anywhere in the gloom. I crawled faster. Without warning, the dim ranks of Dwarven soldiers in front of me went flying as the monstrous guardian loomed before me. He had cut off my escape! As I dodged backwards, blow after blow whistled down as the implacable machine followed me relentlessly, driving me into the far corner of the room. At last there was nowhere left for me to go. My back was to the wall. I glared up at my foe, determined to die on my feet. The huge fists lifted for one final blow."

""What do you want here?"" demanded a voice from near at hand.\n\n""Er … I've come by the Thieves' Highway,"" the gentleman said, almost questioningly. \n\n""What of it?""\n\n""I … I was told to say that, and also 'Tonight flies the Father of Owls.'"" The gentleman's fine lips curved in a tentative smile. ""That's all right, isn't it?""\n\nThe nearby voice gave a noncommittal grunt, then said, ""Your business?""\n\n""I wish to speak to … to the Red Asp.""\n\n""Sure. He's in the back, behind the brew vats."" A shadow in the smoke made a vague gesture, swirling the thick vapors. The gentleman coughed, and began to make his way across the dim room. \n\nThe chamber was a common room of sorts, with a dozen or so tables and three-score mismatched chairs, some of which were occupied with drinkers although somewhere far above the noonday sun shone down on the desert city of Hallin's Stand. The ceiling was low and the gentleman was tall, so he had to weave his way between the low-hanging oil lamps that contributed most of the air's burden of smoke. ""Beetle oil,"" he said to himself, sniffing, ""and the cheapest possible grade."" \n\nBeyond the brew vats the air was a bit less dense, but it was also even darker than in the common room. A single lamp burned upon a table against the far wall, its flame reflecting from a carafe, a flagon, and the embroidered edging on the vest of someone sitting on a chair, leaning back against the wall. \n\nThe gentleman approached the table, stopped at a respectful distance and asked, ""You are … the Red Asp?""\n\nThe front legs of the chair came down with a thump. ""That's what they call me,"" said a low voice from above the vest. ""Traditional title for the doyen of the Hallin's Stand Thieves Guild. And you?""\n\n""My name … isn't important,"" the gentleman said. ""But my business—is.""\n\n""How important?""\n\nThe gentleman drew a sack from his waistband and dropped it on the table. It clanked. The Red Asp opened it with a finger and stirred the contents for moment. ""This would qualify as payment for important business. A down payment, anyway,"" he said. ""What's the target?""\n\n""The Governor of Hallin's Stand.""\n\n""You're in the wrong place, friend,"" said the Red Asp, with just a tinge of regret. ""We don't do assassinations. You want the Dark Brotherhood. Or maybe the Morag Tong—they specialize in regicides.""\n\n""Oh, I don't want you to take the governor's life,"" said the gentleman. ""I want you to steal his honor.""\n\n""His honor?"" the Red Asp said. ""How do you mean?""\n\n""I want you to steal the governor's signet ring, the one the king put on his finger when he received his appointment. It's the symbol of his right to rule. And I want you to take it,"" the gentleman said, ""during the Ceremonial Dance at the Governor's Ball.""\n\nThere was a long pause, and then, ""Deal,"" said the Red Asp. ""Of course, I'll have to handle the matter personally. None of my cutpurses or burglars are up to this sort of job."" He lifted the carafe and poured fragrant pomegranate wine into the flagon. ""Will you drink on it?""\n\n""Both of us,"" the gentleman said, ""from the same vessel?""\n\n""It's how we do things here.""\n\n""In that case,"" said the gentleman in the blue velvet tunic, ""I'd be delighted."""

msgid "A high-ranking member of a Dunmer house, the Dark Elf known as Mal Sorra was cruel and bloodthirsty. She had a penchant for battle, for testing her skills against stronger opponents. In addition, she practiced dark magics and was a necromancer of the highest order. Unfortunately, the House she belonged to had no love of dark magic and even less tolerence for necromancy. But Mal Sorra didn't care. In fact, her blatant disregard of customs and mores thrilled her and made her blood run hot.\n\nAs Mal Sorra's need for greater thrills and constant danger drove her to new heights of cruelty and depravity, the necromancer took greater and greater chances. She flaunted her power, even in the face of House officials and Tribunal dignitaries, daring them to scold her or punish her or attempt to stifle her primeval urges. The first to take her unspoken challenge was her own father, the leader of her House and a powerful mage in his own right. Mal Sorra relished the contest, eager to see if she could hold her own against the man who raised her. In the end, Mal Sorra didn't just survive the challenge, she killed her father in a duel of magicka.\n\nNot content to simply beat her father, Mal Sorra slew him with a barrage of spells and then raised him as a zombie. She commanded the undead creature to follow her and obey her every command. The rest of her house was horrified by this terrible desecration and demanded that Mal Sorra be punished for her blatant use of dark magic. This made Mal Sorra laugh, for she loved showing off her power and displaying her disregard for the current leadership.\n\nAs Mal Sorra became more difficult and dangerous, her mother decided that enough was enough. She mourned for her child, but refused to allow her evil to continue unchecked. Mal Sorra was surprised when her mother and a cadre of mages entered her private chambers. She was amused by the audacity of the action, but she felt no fear or anxiety. When her mother began casting a ritual, however, Mal Sorra felt the first pangs of danger. And, as always, it exhilarated her. But then the other mages joined in, and for the first time she could remember, Mal Sorra was afraid.\n\nHer mother drew on dark magic to punish her daughter. She couldn't abide ending her daughter's existence, but she knew she had to end the threat that Mal Sorra posed to the Houses. The dark magic engulfed Mal Sorra, binding her. Trapped within her own dark magic, Mal Sorra was sealed alive inside the very place she spent so much of her time—within the family tomb. Then the mages combined their magic to open a portal. It swallowed the tomb.\n\n""I curse you, daughter,"" her mother proclaimed with tears in her eyes. ""I banish you and your evil to Oblivion. May the Tribunal show you the mercy you denied your victims."" And with that, Mal Sorra was never seen on Nirn again."

msgid "Transcription and Commentary by Sonia Vette\n\n(The following is a tale overheard, as told by a Khajiiti father to his cub, while making camp with one of their caravans. I have attempted to transcribe it as he told it, for the Khajiit do not often speak of their history to outsiders. In truth I do not believe he would have spoken at all, but for the vast helping of moon-sugar he had consumed that night.)\n\nCome and warm your fur by the fire, Ma-rashirr, and I will tell you of how our Dro-Zira came to be the greatest of all Khajiit! (Ed: Dro-Zira I took in this case to be an honored ancestor.)\n\nThe ancient Khajiit heard the great roar of Alkosh the Great Cat King of Time (Ed: known as Akatosh in the Empire, and Alduin in Skyrim) and raced to his Voice. In three days' time they crossed the whole of Tamriel, resting not even for the moon-sugar, for such was the speed of Khajiiti then.\n\nThey joined with the pride of Alkosh and were his strongest warriors. Lorkhaj (Ed: Shor to the Nords), however, chose to give his roar to the Ra-Wulfharth to spite the Khajiiti warriors, for he was jealous of their devotion to Alkosh.\n\nSeeing the ferocity of the Khajiiti warriors, Ra-Wulfharth could not bring himself to put them to death. Using the roar that Lorkhaj had given him, he spoke to Masser and Secunda, to move to their fullness in the sky. The Khajiiti warriors became Senche, but Lorkhaj stripped from them all reason.\n\nWhen Ra-Wulfharth returned to sink his fangs into the Red Mountain, he called upon his people to aid him. Dro-Zira was the only among the ""Rhojiit"" who still remembered, and so was the only one who answered the summons.\n\nBut these Nord bards are (Ed: expletive removed) and do not sing of how the great Ash King rode Dro-Zira up the Red Mountain itself to strike at the heart of the Dunmer. Never is it mentioned how Dro-Zira pounced atop Dumalacath, the Dwarf-Orc, when he had his blade to the throat of the Ash King so that he could not speak.\n\nNor do they sing of how Lorkhaj returned Dro-Zira from the lands of Sheggorath for his bravery and for saving the Ash King! So when you find a bard who speaks ill of the Khajiit, you be sure to leave him an iron claw in the back to remind him who saved Skyrim.\n\nAs for the rest of the ""Rhojiit,"" they grew small and lost their cunning altogether, which is why you should not hesitate to strike them down when they approach the wagons. So it was told by my father, and so I tell it now to you.\n\nNow, be a good cub and go fetch me some more moon-sugar for these sweet cakes.\n\n(Much of the tale seemed to me little more than a boast, but certain facts do seem to line up with what we believe is the truth behind the legends. It does raise questions as to why we do not know more about history of the Khajiit and what parts they have played that might not have been recorded by our written histories.)"

msgid "From ""The History of Histories, As Told to Young Prince Fahara'jad""\n\nKnow then, O Prince, that the Phyllocid Dynasty did rule in Hammerfell while e'er the province was incorporate in the Second Empire, and of this line of kings, though some were wise and some were foolish, all were noble. And the last of the line, High King Ar-Azal, was most noble of all, for he it was who, for a time, brought an end to the strife of brother against brother, of Crown against Forebear.\n\nHow did this come to be? Hearken, and I shall tell the tale. \n\nUpon the passing of Ja-Fr, the estimable father of the estimable Ar-Azal, the Prince of Hegathe thereupon assumed the Throne of Hegathe, and wore the Diadem of Diagna, and bore the title High King of Hammerfell. And all the nobles of Hammerfell sojourned to Hegathe to pay him obeisance. But the new High King, though so youthful as to be barely bearded, was in no wise a fool, and knew full well that his nobles' show of faithfulness was like unto a cloud, apparent but bereft of substance. For the Forebear nobles liked him not insomuch as Ar-Azal was a Crown, and the Crown nobles mistrusted him insomuch as his father had not crushed the Forebears. And Ar-Azal was in a quandary, for he must needs rule Hammerfell as High King, and yet his support was as weak as a woman who has just given birth.\n\nSo the Worthy Ar-Azal gazed from his High Tower upon the azure Abecean, and prayed many prayers, and thought many thoughts. And presently he thought of the Admirable Zaqeeb, his tutor and mentor, a Priestess of Satakal and a sage of renown. And he went to the Temple and spake unto the Admirable Zaqeeb, saying that he could not solve the riddle of how to reconcile the Crowns and the Forebears. And the Admirable Zaqeeb gave him a libation, saying, ""Drink this tonight, O King, and dream."" And taking the libation, the Worthy Ar-Azal retired in gratitude, and did as he was bade. \n\nAnd that night the Worthy Ar-Azal dreamed a dream of Satakal the World-Snake, who came to him in the guise of a Snakehead Potentate. And the Potentate did homage unto the High King, for he said it was given only to the Worthy Ar-Azal to solve this riddle. And the answer, he said twice, speaking once with each tongue, was to be found at the Shrine of Tava, he being a Divine who received the veneration of both Forebears and Crowns.\n\nThen Ar-Azal heard the cry of a Goshawk, which bird is sacred to Tava, and he awoke, and it was the dawn of the day. And he made haste to the Shrine of Tava in Hegathe, wherein is the Fresco of the Goshawk, which depicts Tava in his nest with his mate. And lo, where once there was one mate depicted in the nest, now there were two, the second mate agleam in the morning light. And Ar-Azal said, ""Truly the Divines have shown me the answer. For has not the greatest Forebear Grandee, Ebrahim of Sentinel, a fair and lissome daughter, Fereshtah? And has not the greatest Crown Grandee, Murahd of Rihad, a fierce and clever daughter, Arlimahera?""\n\nAnd that concludes, O Prince, my tale of Ar-Azal, your Worthy Great-Grand-Uncle. For I know that you are quick of wit, and will work out for yourself how the High King solved his riddle."

The very first night in southern Morrowind, I made camp in a great fungal forest.  \n\nWith fresh nix-meat on my fire, I noticed something in the rocks and stones near my camp. Several large boulders stood distant, propped up by unknown hands what had to be many decades, if not centuries, before. The largest and nearest was the reason I write this. \n\nAs a child, Father took me to the Stables of Lord Aswala to pay our tribe's taxes and endure the stares of the Proscribed. On the way there, we were caught in a great sandstorm and found shelter in a cave. \n""Daughter,"" Father spake. ""Seek water in the cave, as I taught you."" \n\nWith a ""Yes, Father,"" I entered the cave. There was no water, but I did find something grand in a large open cavern deep under the stables.\n\nIn the center were great stones with strange, alien words carved on them. I felt like I could hear them calling to me. I reached out and touched the stone. It was then that a hand covered my mouth, muffling my scream and cutting off my breath until I passed out. \n\nI woke up hours later to my Father's face, his eyes drained of their usual joy. \n\n""Daughter, we must leave this place. More will come."" Father never told me what befell my attackers. From the stains on his clothes, I would guess that it was a grim fate.\n\n""But Father, what of these stones? These symbols?""\n\n""This is a place of blasphemy, beset by demon-worshipers. See here. This word is in the dark speech of the Daedra. It says 'Coldharbour.'""\n\nSo imagine my surprise, O reader, when I looked upon the Morrowind stone in the light of the campfire, my belly full of nix-meat, and saw words written in the same dark speech. The same words I had looked upon as a child, and on the same sort of stones.\n\n""Coldharbour calls. Nirn obeys."" \n\n""Coldharbour calls. Nirn obeys."""

msgid "By Zylmoc Golge\n\nWhen Chance met Ulstyr the next morning, he was wearing chitin armor and had armed himself with an unusual blade that glowed faintly of enchantment. As they began their trek, she tried to engage him in conversation, but his responses were so nonsensical that she quickly abandoned the attempts. A sudden rainstorm swelled over the plain, dousing them, but as she was wearing no armor and Ulstyr was wearing slick chitin, their progress was not impeded.\n \nInto the dark recesses of the Heran Tomb, they delved. Her instincts had been correct—they made very good partners.\n \nShe recognized the ancient snap-wire traps, deadfalls, and brittle backs before they were triggered, and cracked all manners of lock: simple tumbler, combination, twisted hasp, double catch, varieties from antiquity with no modern names, rusted heaps that would have been dangerous to open even if one possessed the actual key.\n \nUlstyr for his part slew scores of bizarre fiends, the likes of which Chance, a city girl, had never seen before. His enchanted blade's spell of fire was particularly effective against the frost atronachs. He even saved her when she lost her footing and nearly plummeted into a shadowy crack in the floor.\n \n""Not to hurt thyself,"" he said, his face showing genuine concern. ""There are walls beyond doors and fifty-three. Drain ring. Two months and back. Prop a rock. Come, Mother Chance.""\n \nChance had not been listening to much of Ulstyr's babbling, but when he said ""Chance,"" she was startled. She had introduced herself to him as Minevah. Could it be that the peasants were right, and that when mad men spoke, they were talking to the Daedra Prince Sheogorath who gave them advice and information beyond their ken? Or was it rather, more sensibly, that Ulstyr was merely repeating what he heard tell of in Balmora where in recent years ""Chance"" had become synonymous with lockpicking?\n \nAs the two continued on, Chance thought of Ulstyr's mumblings. He had said ""chitin"" when they met as if it had just occurred to him, and the chitin armor that he wore had proven useful. Likewise, ""hot steel."" What could ""walls beyond doors"" mean? Or ""two months and back""? What numbered ""fifty-three""?\n \nThe notion that Ulstyr possessed secret knowledge about her and the tomb they were in began to unnerve Chance. She made up her mind then to abandon her companion once the treasure had been found. He had cut through the living and undead guardians of the dungeon: if she merely left by the path they had entered, she would be safe without a defender.\n \nOne phrase he said made perfect sense to her: ""drain ring."" At one of the manors in Balmora, she had picked up a ring purely because she thought it was pretty. It was not until later that she discovered that it could be used to sap other people's vitality. Could Ulstyr be aware of this? Would he be taken by surprise if she used it on him?\n \nShe formulated her plan on how best to desert the Breton as they continued down the hall. Abruptly the passage ended with a large metal door, secured by a golden lock. Using her pick, Chance snapped away the two tumblers and bolt, and swung the door open. The treasure of the Heran Tomb was within.\n \nChance quietly slipped her glove off her hand, exposing the ring as she stepped into the room. There were fifty-three bags of gold within. As she turned, the door closed between her and the Breton. On her side, it did not resemble a door anymore, but a wall. Walls beyond doors.\n \nFor many days, Chance screamed and screamed, as she tried to find a way out of the room. For some days after that, she listened dully to the laughter of Sheogorath within her own head. Two months later, when Ulstyr returned, she was dead. He used a rock to prop open the door and remove the gold."

msgid "When Tazgol gro-Betnikh had not yet fought his third battle, he climbed the cliffs of Betnikh until he was so high he could look beyond the sea to the edge of the world. \n\nHe took neither food nor water, but drank the rainwater that collected in the crevices of the rocks and ate eggs from the nests of birds high on the cliff.\n\nHe climbed three days, and when he reached the top he rested three days.\n\nIt was then that Mauloch gave him the following vision:\n\nHe saw a single great serpent cut into three, and from the three pieces sprang three smaller serpents. \n\nThe three serpents divided the world between them. \n\nOne crawled on its belly and said ""I claim the land and all that grows from it."" \n\nAnother swam in the depths and said ""I claim the water and all that drinks it."" \n\nThe third took to wing and said ""I claim the air and all that breathes it."" \n\nNo sooner had they done so than the serpents fell into conflict. For what is there that lives that does not spring from the earth, or drink water, or breathe air? So each serpent thought he had dominion over the others. \n\nIn time, the serpents fought each other and were destroyed.\n\nThen Tazgol was perplexed by what he had seen, and he returned from the cliffs and told Thurga the Wise what Mauloch had shown him.\n\nThurga the Wise, who had interpreted many visions, said, ""This is a vision with two lessons. The first is that division without unity is fatal.""\n\n""But how can there be both division and unity?"" Tazgol asked her.\n\n""Naive question,"" the Wise Woman barked back. ""Don't the chief's three wives hate each other and yet love the chief, and so share the same desire? Is there not division when a young Orc challenges the chief and unity when the new chief is proclaimed triumphant? Just so, the three serpents were destroyed when they forgot that they were not three serpents but one serpent divided.""\n\n""But how do we maintain both division and unity?"" The young warrior wondered.\n\nThe Wise Woman chuckled: ""That is the second lesson of your vision: remember the past."""

And yet, his prestige amongst the nearby towns was so high, no one dared refuse to negotiate a bride-price with him.\n\nThe maiden, whose name was Zarrineh, knelt at the shrine for a full night and a day before returning to her village.

msgid "by Enric Milnes\n\nI might never have gone to the Alik'r Desert had I not met Weltan in a little tavern in Sentinel. Weltan is a Redguard poet whose verse I had read, but only in translation. He chooses to write in the old language of the Redguards, not in Tamrielic. I once asked him why.\n\n""The Tamrielic word for the divinely rich child of rot, silky, pressed sour milk is … cheese,"" said Weltan, a huge smile spreading like a tide over his lampblack face. ""The Old Redguard word for it is mluo. Tell me, if you were a poet fluent in both languages, which word would you use?""\n\nI am a child of the cities, and I would tell him tales of the noise and corruption, wild nights and energy, culture and decadence. He listened with awed appreciation of the city of my birth: white-marbled Imperial City where all the citizenry are convinced of their importance because of the proximity of the Emperor and the lustration of the streets. They say that a beggar on the boulevards of the Imperial City is a man living in a palace. Over spiced ale, I regaled Weltan with descriptions of the swarming marketplace of Riverhold; of dark, brooding Mournhold; of the mold-encrusted villas of Lilmoth; the wonderful, dangerous alleys of Helstrom; the stately avenues of grand old Solitude. For all this, he marvelled, inquired, and commented.\n\n""I feel as if I know your home, the Alik'r Desert, from your poems even though I've never been there."" I told him.\n\n""Oh, but you don't. No poem can express the Alik'r. It may prepare you for a visit far better than the best guide book can. But if you want to know Tamriel and be a true citizen of the planet, you must go and feel the desert yourself.""\n\nIt took me a little over a year to break off engagements, save money (my greatest challenge), and leave the urban life for the Alik'r Desert. I brought several books of Weltan's poems as my travel guide.\n\n""A sacred flame rises above the fire, The ghosts of great men and women without names, Cities long dead rise and fall in the flame, The Dioscori Song of Revelation, Bursting walls and deathless rock, Fiery sand that heals and destroys.""\n\nThese first six lines from my friend's ""On the Immortality of Dust"" prepared me for my first image of the Alik'r Desert, though they hardly do it justice. My poor pen cannot duplicate the severity, grandeur, ephemera and permanence of the Alik'r.\n\nAll the principalities and boundaries the nations have placed on the land dissolve under the moving sand in the desert. I could never tell if I was in Antiphyllos or Bergama, and few of the inhabitants could tell me. For them, and so it came to me, we were simply in the Alik'r. No. We are part of the Alik'r. That is closer to the philosophy of the desert people.\n\nI saw the sacred flame of which Weltan wrote on my first morning in the desert: a vast, red mist that seemed to come from the deep mystery of Tamriel. Long before the noon sun, the mist had disappeared. Then I saw the cities of Weltan. The ruins of the Alik'r rise from the sand by one blast of the unbounded wind and are covered by the next. Nothing in the desert lasts, but nothing dies forever.\n\nAt daylight, I hid myself in tents, and thought about the central character of the Redguards that would cause them to adopt this savage, eternal land. They are warriors by nature. As a group, there are none better. Nothing for them has worth unless they have struggled for it. No one fought them for the desert, but the Alik'r is a great foe. The battle goes on. It is a war without rancor, a holy war in the sense the phrase should always imply.\n\nBy night, I could contemplate the land itself in its relative serenity. But the serenity was superficial. The stones themselves burned with a heat and a light that comes not from the sun, nor the moons Jone and Jode. The power of the stones comes from the beat of the heart of Tamriel itself.\n\nTwo years I spent in the Alik'r.\n\nAs write this, I am back in Sentinel. We are at war with the Ebonheart Pact and the Aldmeri Dominion. All my fellow poets, writers, and artists are despondent for the greed and pride that brought these people into battle. It is a low point, a tragedy. In the words of Old Redguard, an ajcea, a spiral down.\n\nYet, I cannot be sorrowful. In the years I spent in the glories of the Alik'r, I have seen the eternal stones that live on while men go dead. I have found my inner eye in the tractless, formless, changeless and changeable land. Inspiration and hope, like the stones of the desert, are eternal though men be not."

You covered it up with that bench.\n \nANARA: I didn't do it on purpose, serjo! I was just cleaning! I see that armor every day, serjo, and b'vek I swear I ain't never noticed the shield before!\n \nCLAVIDES: It's fine, Anara, I believe you.\n\nClavides pushes on the shield and it pulls back to reveal a tunnel down. \n\nCLAVIDES: It appears that Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr does have a need for a secret passage. Could you get me a torch?\n \nANARA: B'vek, I ain't never seen that before!\n\nAnara takes a torch from the wall, and hands it to Clavides. Clavides enters the tunnel. \n\nCLAVIDES: Wait here.\n\nAnara watches Clavides disappear down the tunnel. She appears agitated, and finally runs for the front door. When she opens it, ULLIS, an Argonian lieutenant in the Imperial guard is standing at the entrance. She screams. \n\nULLIS: I'm sorry to frighten you.\n \nANARA: Not now! Go away!\n \nULLIS: I'm afraid the Captain wouldn't like that, miss.\n \nANARA: You're … with the Captain? Blessed mother.\n\nClavides comes out of the tunnel, white-faced. It takes him a few moments to speak. \n\nULLIS: Captain? What's down there?\n \nCLAVIDES (to Anara): Did you know your master's a necromancer? That your cellar is filled with bodies?\n\nAnara faints. Ullis carries her to the bench and lays her down. \n\nULLIS: Let me see, serjo.\n \nCLAVIDES: You'll see soon enough. We're going to need every soldier from the post here to cart away all the corpses. Ullis, I've seen enough battles, but I've never seen anything like this. No two are alike. Khajiiti, Sload, Dunmer, Cyrodiil, Breton, Nord, burned alive, poisoned, electrified, melted, torn apart, turned inside out, ripped to shreds and sewn back up together.\n \nULLIS: You think the Ashlander escaped, that's what happened?\n \nCLAVIDES: I don't know. Why would someone do something like this, Ullis?\n\nThere is a knock on the door. Clavides answers it. A young Argonian woman, ZOLLASSA, is standing, holding a package and a letter. \n\nZOLLASSA: Good morning, you're not Lord Xyr, are you?\n \nCLAVIDES: No. What do you have there?\n \nZOLLASSA: A letter and a package I'm supposed to deliver to him. Will he be back shortly?\n \nCLAVIDES: I don't believe so. Who gave you the package to deliver?\n \nZOLLASSA: My teacher at the college, Kema Warvim. He has a bad leg, so he asked me to bring these to his lordship. Actually, to tell you the truth, I was supposed to deliver them last night, but I was busy.\n \nULLIS: Greetings, sister. We'll give the package to his lordship when we see him.\n \nZOLLASSA: Ah, hail, brother. I had heard there was a handsome Argonian in Scath Anud. Unfortunately, I promised Kema Warvim that I'd deliver the package directly to his lordship's hands. I'm already late, I can't just—\n \nCLAVIDES: We're Imperial Guard, miss. We will take the package and the letter.\n\nZollassa reluctantly hands Clavides the letter and the package. She turns to go. \n\nULLIS: You're at the college, if we need to see you?\n \nZOLLASSA: Yes. Fair tidings, brother.\n \nULLIS: Goodnight, sister.\n\nClavides opens the package as Zollassa exits. It is a book with many loose sheets. \n\nCLAVIDES: It appears we've found the missing book. Delivered to our very hands.\n\nClavides begins to read the book, silently to himself. \n\nULLIS (to himself, very pleased): Another Argonian in Scath Anud. And a pretty one, at that. I hope we weren't too rude to her. I'm tired of all these women with their smooth, dry skin, it would be wonderful if we could meet when I'm off duty.\n\nWhile Ullis talks, he opens the letter and reads it. \n\nULLIS (continued): She looks like she's from the south, like me. You know, Argonians from northern Black Marsh are… much… less….\n\nUllis continues reading, transfixed by the letter. Clavides skips to the back of the book, and reads the last sentences."

It was the voice of Sotha Sil that shook him from his thoughts.\n\n""You should rest more often, my friend. A tired mind makes puzzles out of even simple things."" The Scribe looked up. Sil was there and not there, as usual.\n\n""I didn't expect I'd see you again,"" said the Scribe. The words were perhaps harsher than he intended. In truth, his heart swelled at the sight.\n\n""You could not write the words this time,"" said Sotha Sil. ""Because they were for me?""\n\nThe Scribe shrugged. ""How could I?"" The question needed no elaboration. Both knew what they meant to each other.\n\nSeht smiled. A rare sight, even when he was among friends. ""I like what you did with the garden. Roland's Tears. Clever.""\n\n""Manipulative,"" the Scribe said distastefully.\n\nSotha Sil spread his arms. He had chosen to portray them both as flesh this time. ""Is that not the role of the Scribe?""\n\n""I wanted them to know you as I do, but the words wouldn't come. I had to pass the task on to another.""\n\n""You mean you trusted another with a task so dear to your heart that you could not put quill to parchment."" Seht's tone bore a rare hint of playful amusement. ""That is no bad thing for people like us.""\n\nThe Scribe shook his head. ""I was afraid of being wrong.""\n\n""No, you were afraid of being imperfect."" Sotha Sil conjured an old tome and flipped through the pages. ""You always are. Do you really love them so much?""\n\nThe Scribe stood slowly, turning to gaze at a map of Nirn pinned to the wall of his chambers. ""No,"" he spoke the truth quietly. ""But I love her. And she belongs to them.""\n\n""If it helps, the words I spoke were true.""\n\n""I know,"" said the Scribe. ""I have read them many times.""\n\n""You like them,"" said Seht.\n\n""I do."" \n\nSotha Sil made a chair for himself and sat. The Scribe turned to his friend, his mentor, his child shared with many fathers. ""Did you come to say goodbye, Seht?""\n\n""In a way,"" Seht replied, and there was no sadness in his voice. ""Perhaps another form will appear that looks much like me and plays the role he is needed to play in yet another tale. I will be gone by then.""\n\nThe Scribe nodded as he returned to his chair. He looked across the writing desk at Sotha Sil's face and Seht's eyes. \n\n""Will what we tried to do be enough?"" The Scribe saw understanding as he spoke. The Light of Knowledge could give courage to Prisoners, but never to the Scribe.\n\n""This world cannot know peace,"" said Sotha Sil the God. ""Just as its caretakers cannot. It will never be enough, but we persevere for the beauty of dawn in spite of long nights."" \n\nIt was Seht that leaned forward then. ""Every parent believes they have not done enough.""\n\nThe Scribe reflected then on his many regrets, but spoke only one. ""I tried to save you,"" he said. ""To give some weight to the myths. But I cannot stop what is.""\n\n""You chose not to because you love me."" Once again, the words of a god rang true.\n\n""You are the Father of Mysteries,"" said the Scribe.\n\n""And I must leave, whether I wish to or not,"" said Seht. ""If only so Sotha Sil can remain.""\n\nThe Scribe nodded again. ""Will you leave any instruction for us?""\n\nThe Clockwork God pursed his lips, then spoke. ""Beware the leap to certainty. The Named Daedra have many aspects. Many faces. Do not let one aspect overpower another, for they are agents of chaos. To let their nature calcify will lead to complacency and ruin. This era of strife cannot end until you scatter the lie of their simplicity.""\n\nThe Scribe bowed his head in silent assent, then opened his eyes again. ""And you, Seht?""\n\n""I saw the imperfections in everything I ever attempted,"" said Seht, glancing at the map of Nirn. ""Even imperfections in my pursuit to rid myself of them. Yet I could never stop tinkering. I could never stop creating. I loved her too much. I will give no instruction to you who have already come to know love.""\n\nSotha Sil's body dematerialized into a thousand tiny lights. They danced around the room, illuminating books, and scrolls, and maps with a divine golden glow. It was Seht that spoke the last.\n\n""I leave it to you.""\n\nA heady silence settled in the Scribe's chamber—filling the dimly-lit room with renewed and solemn purpose. At length, the Scribe's mouth turned to a smile, and once again he took up his quill."

msgid "By The Unveiled Azadiyeh, Songbird of Satakalaam\n\n— Listen now, O Estimable Vizier, to a tale of a haunted tower.\n\n— A haunted tower? Do you speak sooth? Many and more are the tales of ghost-haunted towers, until it seems there must be hardly a tower that has not its spectre. Has the Songbird's well of stories at last gone dry? \n\n— Nay, be but patient, one-who-governs-with-wisdom. For the tale of the Old Tower of the Fallen Waste is unlike any you have heard before. \n\n— Say on then, O spellbinder. I will withhold judgment until I have heard the tale. \n\n— Patience as well as wisdom! Truly you have earned all the accolades that are laid at your feet, Honorable Vizier. \n\n— On with the story, Songbird. I get enough honeyed words from the lickspittle dogs at court. \n\n— As you command. There was, high atop a pinnacle in a lonely corner of the Fallen Wastes, a tall and ill-favored tower that had stood there long and long. In the days when the Redguards warred against the Tusked Folk, a scout of the Bergama Gallants was commanded to take possession of this tower, thereupon to post himself as observer and sentry. And his name was Abadaman of the Three Scars.\n\n— And there at night this Abadaman was visited by the sorrowing ghost of a nubile maiden? Or did the shade of his long-dead father appear to deliver a timely warning? Ah, but wait, I have it: The spirit of a murdered man moaned in the gloaming that he could not rest until his killing was avenged. \n\n— Nay, none of these haps did eventuate. Yet a haunting did occur, and strange to say, it took place in the golden light of noon. It happened in this wise: Abadaman of the Three Scars had done his morning devoirs, which consisted of climbing the many steps to the top of the Old Tower, peering to every point of the compass, and making note of what he saw, which was nothing of import. So went he for a walk in the desert, for this Abadaman liked to think, and when he thought he liked to walk. On this day of days his wandering took him down to the arid flats beneath the towered pinnacle, and there his thoughts were interrupted for his eyes beheld a wonder: beneath the bright noonday sun stood a coterie of ghosts, gazing about as if awaiting an imminent event.\n\n— Intriguing. This accords with no tale of haunting I have otherwise heard. \n\n— Yet I assure Your Munificence, it was so. The ghosts were eight in number, and though they were difficult to perceive clearly in the shimmering heat of daylight, their presence was undeniable. They were young Redguards all, and were clad in the armor of soldiers, like that of Abadaman, yet unlike as well. He took one of these ghosts, who had a commanding presence, to be the officer of the others. When the officer-wraith turned his head and locked eyes with Abadaman, the scout, though stout of heart, cried out in surprise. \n\n— Even I might do the same, I do confess it. \n\n— Perhaps, though you must give me leave to doubt it. At the scout's cry the ghost spake in a voice of echoes, saying, ""Well met, scout. Though the device upon your breast is unfamiliar, I see you are one of our soldiers. Are you he who will mete out justice to the one who betrayed us?""\n\n— Ah ha! A story of revenge. Did I not say so? These ghosts are all the same.\n\n— You are correct, Your Efficacy—and yet you are not. Shall I say on? \n\n— Such is my will. \n\n— I hear and obey. At these words the brave Abadaman was filed with wonder, and was moved to reply, saying, ""I know naught of what you speak, spirit-from-across-the-great-river. Yet I would hear more."" ""I am Captain Fayda,"" said the spirit, ""and these are my soldiers, slain by treachery. We seek justice upon the traitor, yet we are confounded, for though dead we are unborn, and though murdered our killer has not harmed us.""\n\n— A riddle, by Tava's shining eye! And what said the scout to that?\n\n— He said, ""You speak in enigmas, O Captain, which as yet I cannot fathom. Tell me of how you were betrayed, that I might know more."" The ghostly captain nodded and said, ""That I may do. We were ordered to garrison the Old Tower, though we have not been so ordered. Unbeknownst to us, one of our number was beholden unto our enemies the invading Imperials, though none have invaded. He did secretly admit them through our defenses and we were undone, though no such event has occurred. And the traitor's name was Amil Red-Hand.""\n\n— Ah, I see now. The ghost is mad, and cannot speak words of sense.\n\n— Nay, for the words abruptly made sense to Abadaman, and he reeled back as if stricken. ""Alas!"" he cried. ""All is now clear! You are dead though unborn, for your life and death are both yet to come! You speak of a treachery that has not yet occurred, but it will many years from now. You appear before me, O lamentable haunt, because I and only I am in a position to mete out justice to your betrayer. But this I will never do.""\n\n— How can this be? Explain forthwith!\n\n— Alas, my Vizier, a tale is like a river and flows only as it will. But this one nears its end. ""That you will never do, though you are an honorable soldier?"" moaned the officer's ghost. ""Wherefore?"" ""Wherefore the name of my infant son is Amil, born with a red mark upon his hand. Therefore away, importunate ghosts, for I shall not help you, and you cannot escape your fate."" And then Abadaman of the Three Scars turned his feet back up the trail to the Old Tower."

Argonian. \nZollassa, a young Argonian mage \n\nAct I\nLate evening. The play opens in the interior Great Entrance Hall of a castle in Scath Anud, replete with fine furnishings and tapestries. Torches provide the only illumination. In the center of the foyer is a great iron door, the main entrance to the castle. The staircase up to the landing above is next to this door. On stage left is the door to the library, which is currently closed. On stage right is a huge suit of armor, twenty feet tall, nearly touching the ceiling of the room. Though no one can be seen, there is the sound of a woman singing coming from the library door. A loud thumping knock on the iron front door stops the woman's singing. The door to the library opens and ANARA, a common-looking maid, comes out and hurries to open the front door. CLAVIDES, a handsome man in Imperial garb stands there. \n\nANARA: Good evening to you, serjo.\n \nCLAVIDES: Good evening. Is your master at home?\n \nANARA: No, serjo, it's only me here. My master Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr is at his winter estate. Is there something I can do for you?\n \nCLAVIDES: Possibly. Would you mind if I came in?\n \nANARA: Not at all, serjo. Please. May I offer you some flin?\n\nClavides comes into the Hall and looks around. \n\nCLAVIDES: No thank you. What's your name?\n \nANARA: Anara, serjo.\n \nCLAVIDES: Anara, when did your master leave Scath Anud?\n \nANARA: More than a fortnight ago. That's why it's only me in the castle, serjo. All the other servants and slaves who tend to his lordship travel with him. Is there something wrong?\n \nCLAVIDES: Yes, there is. Do you know an Ashlander by the name of Sul-Kharifa?\n \nANARA: No, serjo. I don't know no one by that name.\n \nCLAVIDES: Then you aren't likely to now. He's dead. He was found a few hours ago dying of frostbite in the Ashlands. He was hysterical, nearly incomprehensible, but among his last words were ""castle"" and ""Xyr.""\n \nANARA: Dying of frostbite in summertide in the Ashlands? B'vek, that's strange. I suppose it's possible that my master knew this man, but being an Ashlander and my master being of the House of Telvanni, well, if you'll pardon me for being flippant, serjo, I don't think they coulda been friends.\n \nCLAVIDES: That is your master's library? Would you mind if I looked in?\n \nANARA: Please, serjo, go wherever you want. We got nothing to hide. We're loyal Imperial subjects.\n \nCLAVIDES: As, I hear, are all Telvanni.\n\n(Note from the playwright: this line should be delivered without sarcasm. Trust the audience to laugh—it never fails, regardless of the politics of the locals.) \n\nClavides enters the library and looks over the books. \n\nCLAVIDES: The library needs dusting.\n \nANARA: Yes, serjo. I was just doing that when you knocked at the door.\n \nCLAVIDES: I'm grateful for that. If you had finished, I wouldn't notice the space in the dust where a rather large book has recently been removed. Your master is a wizard, it seems.\n \nANARA: No, serjo. I mean, he studies a lot, but he don't cast no spells, if that's what you mean by wizard. He's a kena, went to college and everything. You know, now that I think about it, I know what happened to that book. One of the other kenas from the college been round yesterday, and borrowed a couple of books. He's a friend of the master, so I thought it'd be all fine.\n \nCLAVIDES: This kena, was his name Warvim?\n \nANARA: Coulda been. I don't remember.\n \nCLAVIDES: There is a suspected necromancer at the college named Kena Warvim we arrested last night. We don't know what he was doing at the college, but it was something illegal, that's for certain. Was that the kena who borrowed the book? A little fellow, a cripple with a withered leg?\n \nANARA: No, serjo, it weren't the kena from yesterday. He was a big fella who could walk, so I noticed.\n \nCLAVIDES: I'm going to have a look around the rest of the house, if you don't mind.\n\n Clavides goes up the stairs, and delivers the following dialogue from the landing and the rooms above. Anara continues straightening up the downstairs, moving a high-backed bench in front of the armor to scrub the floor. \n\nANARA: Can I ask, serjo, what you're looking for? Maybe I could help you.\n \nCLAVIDES: Are these all the rooms in the castle? No secret passages?\n \nANARA (laughing): Oh, serjo, what would Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr want with secret passages?\n \nCLAVIDES (looking at the armor): Your master is a big man.\n \nANARA (laughing): Oh, serjo, don't tease. That's giant armor, just for decoration. My master slew that giant ten years ago, and kind of keeps it for a souvenir.\n \nCLAVIDES: That's right, I remember hearing something about that when I first took my post here. It was someone named Xyr who killed the giant, but I didn't think the first name was Hordalf. Memory fades I'm afraid. What was the giant's name?\n \nANARA: I'm afraid I don't remember, serjo.\n \nCLAVIDES: I do. It was Torfang. ""I got out of Torfang's Shield.""\n \nANARA: I don't understand, serjo. Torfang's shield?\n\nClavides runs down the stairs, and examines the armor. \n\nCLAVIDES: Sul-Kharifa said something about getting out of Torfang's shield. I thought he was just raving, out of his mind.\n \nANARA: But he ain't got a shield, serjo."

msgid "By Enric Milres\n\n""I did not come here to hire the Brotherhood,"" I said respectfully.\n \n""Then why are you here?"" the Night Mother asked, her eyes never leaving mine.\n \nI told her I wanted to know about her. I did not expect an answer to that, but she told me.\n \n""I do not mind the stories you writers dream up about me,"" she chuckled. ""Some of them are very amusing, and some of them are good for business. I like the sexy dark woman lounging on the divan in Carlovac Townway's fiction particularly. The truth is that my history would not make a very dramatic tale. I was a thief, long, long ago, back when the Thieves Guild was only beginning. It's such a bother to sneak around a house when performing a burglary, and many of us found it most efficacious to strangle the occupant of the house. Just for convenience. I suggested to the Guild that a segment of our order be dedicated to the arts and sciences of murder.\n \n""It did not seem like such a controversial idea to me,"" the Night Mother shrugged. ""We had specialists in catburglary, pick-pocketing, lockpicking, fencing, all the other essential parts of the job. But the Guild thought that encouraging murder would be bad for business. Too much, too much, they argued.\n \n""They might have been right,"" the old woman continued. ""But I discovered there is a profit to be made, just the same, from sudden death. Not only can one rob the deceased, but, if your victim has enemies, which rich people often do, you can be paid for it even more. I began to murder people differently when I discovered that. After I strangled them, I would put two stones in their eyes, one black and one white.""\n \n""Why?"" I asked.\n \n""It was a sort of calling card of mine. You're a writer—don't you want your name on your books? I couldn't use my name, but I wanted potential clients to know me and my work. I don't do it anymore, no need to, but at the time, it was my signature. Word spread, and I soon had quite a successful business.""\n \n""And that became the Morag Tong?"" I asked.\n \n""Oh, dear me, no,"" the Night Mother smiled. ""The Morag Tong was around long before my time. I know I'm old, but I'm not that old. I merely hired on some of their assassins when they began to fall apart after the murder of the last Potentate. They did not want to be members of the Tong anymore, and since I was the only other murder syndicate of any note, they just joined on.""\n \nI phrased my next question carefully. ""Will you kill me now that you've told me all this?""\n \nShe nodded sadly, letting out a little grandmotherly sigh. ""You are such a nice, polite young man, I hate to end our acquaintanceship. I don't suppose you would agree to a concession or two in exchange for your life, would you?""\n \nTo my everlasting shame, I did agree. I said I would say nothing about our meeting, which, as the reader can see, was a promise I eventually, years later, chose not to keep. Why have I endangered my life thus?\n \nBecause of the promises I did keep.\n \nI helped the Night Mother and the Dark Brotherhood in acts too despicable, too bloody for me to set to paper. My hand quivers as I think about the people I betrayed, beginning with that night. I tried to write my poetry, but ink seemed to turn to blood. Finally, I fled, changing my name, going to a land where no one would know me.\n \nAnd I wrote this. The true history of the Night Mother, from the interview she gave me on the night we met. It will be the last thing I ever write, this I know. And every word is true.\n \nPray for me.\n\n— Editor's Note: Though originally published anonymously, the identity of the author has never been in serious doubt. Any layman familiar with the work of the poet Enric Milres will recognize Sacred Witness' familiar cadence and style in such books of his as ""The Alik'r."" Shortly after publication, Milres was murdered, and his killer was never found. He had been strangled, and two stones, a black one and a white one, crushed into his eyesockets. Very brutally."

msgid "By Enric Milres\n\nI have met countesses and courtesans, empresses and witches, ladies of war and slatterns of peace, but I have never met a woman like the Night Mother. And I never will again.\n \nI am a writer, a poet of some small renown. If I told you my name, you may have heard of me, but very likely, not. For decades until very recently, I had adopted the city of Sentinel on the coast of Hammerfell as my home, and kept the company of other artists, painters, tapestrists, and writers. No one I knew would have known an assassin by sight, least of all the queen of them, the Blood Flower, the Lady Death, the Night Mother.\n \nNot that I had not heard of her.\n \nSome years ago, I had the good fortune of meeting Pelarne Assi, a respected scholar, who had come to Hammerfell to do research for a book about the Order of Diagna. His essay, ""The Brothers of Darkness,"" together with Ynir Gorming's ""Fire and Darkness: The Brotherhoods of Death,"" are considered to be the canon tomes on the subject of Tamriel's orders of assassins. By luck, Gorming himself was also in Sentinel, and I was privileged to sit with the two in a dark skooma den in the musty slums of the city, as we smoked and talked about the Dark Brotherhood, the Morag Tong, and the Night Mother.\n \nWhile not disputing the possibility that the Night Mother may be immortal or at least very long-lived, Assi thought it most likely that several women—and perhaps some men—throughout the ages had assumed the honorary title. It was no more logical to say there was only one Night Mother, he asserted, than to say there was only one King of Sentinel.\n \nGorming argued that there never was a Night Mother, at least no human one. The Night Mother was Mephala herself, whom the Brotherhood revered second only to Sithis.\n \n""I don't suppose there's any way of knowing for certain,"" I said, in a note of diplomacy.\n \n""Certainly there is,"" whispered Gorming with a grin. ""You could talk to that cloaked fellow in the corner.""\n \nI had not noticed the man before, who sat by himself, eyes hidden by his cloak, seemingly as much a part of the dingy place as the rough stone and unswept floor. Turning back to Ynir, I asked him why that man would know about the Night Mother.\n \n""He's a Dark Brother,"" hissed Pellarne Assi. ""That's as plain as the moons. Don't even joke about speaking with him about Her.""\n \nWe moved on to other arguments about the Morag Tong and the Brotherhood, but I never forgot the image of the lone man, looking at nothing and everything, in the corner of the dirty room, with fumes of skooma smoke floating around him like ghosts. When I saw him weeks later on the streets of Sentinel, I followed him.\n \nYes, I followed him. The reader may reasonably ask ""Why"" and ""How."" I don't blame you for that.\n \n""How"" was simply a question of knowing my city as well as I do. I'm not a thief, not particularly sure-footed and quiet, but I know the alleys and streets of Sentinel intimately from decades worth of ambling. I know which bridges creak, which buildings cast long irregular shadows, the intervals at which the native birds begin the ululations of their evening songs. With relative ease, I kept pace with the Dark Brother and out of his sight and hearing.\n \nThe answer to ""Why"" is even simpler. I have the natural curiosity of the born writer. When I see a strange new animal, I must observe. It is the writer's curse.\n \nI trailed the cloaked man deeper into the city, down an alleyway so narrow it was scarcely a crack between two tenements, past a crooked fence, and suddenly, miraculously, I was in a place I had never seen before. A little courtyard cemetery, with a dozen old half-rotted wooden tombstones. None of the surrounding buildings had windows that faced it, so no one knew this miniature necropolis existed.\n \nNo one, except the six men and one woman standing in it. And me.\n \nThe woman saw me immediately, and gestured for me to come closer. I could have run, but—no, I couldn't have. I had pierced a mystery right in my adopted Sentinel, and I could not leave it.\n \nShe knew my name, and she said it with a sweet smile. The Night Mother was a little old lady with fluffy white hair, cheeks like wrinkled apples that still carried the flush of youth, friendly eyes, blue as the Iliac Bay. She softly took my arm as we sat down amidst the graves and discussed murder.\n \nShe was not always in Hammerfell, not always available for direct assignment, but it seemed she enjoyed actually talking to her clientele.\n \n""I did not come here to hire the Brotherhood,"" I said respectfully.\n \n""Then why are you here?"" the Night Mother asked, her eyes never leaving mine.\n \nI told her I wanted to know about her. I did not expect an answer to that, but she told me."

Rouse those who still can stand."" To be crippled and unmanned would mean the end of their voyage. He would return with their cargo, or he would return not at all.\n\nSoon, all had left the bare decks and fled to the open shores of the island.

All eyes turned toward him, the midday sun signaling a new day. The sand coursed out of his beard like so much water.\n\n""I thought it best not to wake you.""

Everybody goes for a picnic on Sovereignty Day!""\n\n""Yes, but not to Pelin Graveyard. And the weather isn't looking very good for a picnic—it's so gloomy."" She shivered. \n\n""Not to worry,"" I said, leading the way past through the wrought-iron fences and into the great cemetery. ""We'll have a roof over our heads. We're going to eat inside this old mausoleum here.""\n\n""Wh-what?"" Falinne said. ""But this is the crypt of ….""\n\n""Of your namesake, Baroness Falinne Guimard, who commanded the troops of Bangkorai on Sovereignty Day? The very same."" I smiled, bowed, and waved her in to the dark mausoleum. \n\nFalinne looked inside and gulped, then said, ""All right, Jacques. You can't scare me."" And, hunching her head a bit into her shoulders, she ducked into the Baroness' last resting place. \n\nI followed, unfolding the picnic blanket with a flourish. ""Here we are! No need to sit directly on the clammy, strangely-stained flagstones of the dark and dismal charnel vault. Comfort and elegance are my watchwords!"" \n\n""Very funny, Jacques."" She smiled gamely and folded her legs beneath her as I put the picnic basket in the center of the blanket. ""So what did you bring?""\n\n""Chef Artoine's deluxe picnic collation from the Anchor's Point inn! A brace of rock pigeons, grilled and deboned, with combwort chutney, ballom pudding, and a jug of syllabub. Unless for pigeon….""\n\n""…Less … egion…"" a voice whispered from the back of the vault.\n\n""Er… an echo, by Mara! Did—did you hear that, Falinne?""\n\n""…Falinne … Aless … Legion …!"" came the whisper, louder this time. \n\n""I certainly heard that!"" Falinne said, leaping up. ""Jacques, what kind of trick are you playing here?""\n\n""Alessian Legion! Where?"" said the voice, quite distinctly. And before our widening eyes, a blue phantasm came drifting up from a steep and narrow stairwell. \n\nWith a shriek, Falinne backed flat against the far wall and froze, seemingly paralyzed. I felt cold stones at my own back and realized I'd done the same.\n\nThe translucent blue phantasm, clad in armor of antique design, drifted between us, halted at the entrance, and turned. ""This is the day, isn't it?"" she demanded in hollow tones. ""The day of the attack!""\n\n""Y-yes, Countess,"" I said, surprised at my ability to speak. ""Right d-day, but wrong century.""\n\n""What?"" She flew at me, spectral hands raised like claws. Somehow, I shrank even further into the wall. ""What? Not … again."" \n\n""That's right!"" Falinne piped up. ""Wrong century, wrong year! Go back to sleep, Grandmother.""\n\n""Wrong … year,"" the spectre said slowly. ""Back … to sleep."" \n\nAnd to our immense relief, the Countess' ghost began drifting back down the stairs, fading as it went.\n\n""Gales of Kynareth!"" Falinne said, sinking to the floor. ""I need a drink. You?""\n\n""Oh, yes. At least one,"" I said, as she poured the syllabub. ""What's taking so long?""\n\n""My hands are shaking. Here.""\n\nI drained the milk-and-cider to the dregs and passed the mug back for more. Then I took a deep breath and began, ""Falinne, I'm really, really sorry. I never thought….""\n\n""Don't worry about it,"" she said. ""Here, have some more. Think what a great story it'll make back at the Anchor's Point.""\n\n""You're not angry? Really?""\n\n""No, Jacques. Not angry.""\n\n""Well then, let me carve the … huh, that's funny."" As I reached for the plate of pigeons, I felt a wave of cold pass over my body, and my hand fell short. ""By Arkay, what …?"" I tried to stand, got as far as my knees and then fell over onto the blanket. ""Falinne, something's … something's wrong.""\n\n""It's nothing, dearest,"" she said, smiling sweetly. ""I just drugged your syllabub with a paralyzing potion.""\n\n""D-drugged?"" I mumbled. ""Why?""\n\n""Because there's this really exclusive club I want to join. Namira's Forgotten? But to be admitted, you have to consume human flesh. It's quite thrilling, Jacques!"" She drew a slender, razor-sharp blade from her bodice. ""Now, let's see—where shall I begin?"""

We've collected these stories into this volume, writing down what was previously passed on by word of mouth and around Nord campfires in the dead of night.\n\nThe Voices in the Woods\n\nBroggo the Small wasn't a large Nord. He wasn't a fast Nord. He wasn't even a strong Nord. But Broggo made up for his shortcomings by being something that many Nords aren't: Broggo was smart. He took the time to consider everything he ever did, refusing to give in to the passions that drive most others of his kin. And that eventually saved his life.\n\nOne day, Broggo the Small happened to get separated from his companions. He found himself lost and alone in the Haunted Wood. As he wandered along, becoming increasingly scared and hungry, Broggo stumbled into a clearing among the trees. He decided to rest for a bit, stretching out upon a relatively flat, smooth stone bathed in the afternoon sun. It didn't take long for Broggo to fall fast asleep.\n\nHe awoke later, opening his eyes to find that night had fallen across the forest. Something had pulled him from sleep: a sound. It was like the whispering of young women. And giggling. He was certain that someone or something had giggled, but he seemed to be alone in the clearing, illuminated by the pale glow of the quarter moon above. Broggo was straining to see into the darkness beyond the clearing when the whispers resumed.\n\n""Oh, look at his adorable roots!"" said a voice in the woods.\n\n""And his golden leaves!"" said another.\n\n""He's mine, sister. I saw him first.""\n\n""You got the last one! This one is for me!""\n\nBroggo nearly fainted when the two ghostly forms materialized at the edge of the clearing, near the large gorapple tree. A pair of forest spirits were arguing over him. He didn't know whether to be frightened or flattered, although he did know that mortals and spirits shouldn't mix. He didn't think he could get very far by running through the forest in the dark. He was certain he couldn't fight the spirits, so Broggo had only one option.\n\n""Hello,"" Broggo called to the spirits. ""Would you like to play a game?""\n\nAt first, the spirits appeared shy and even a little frightened of Broggo. They weren't used to mortals talking to them directly, but they slowly began to engage with the Nord, sometimes while visible and sometimes as disembodied voices in the darkness, Broggo described a wondrous game that used cards and dice and clay chips. It was like no game that either of the spirits had ever heard of, or any Nord, for that matter. Broggo was making things up as he spoke. \n\nSoon, the forest spirits were huddled close to Broggo, listening intently to every word the small Nord said. Finally, they shouted in unison, ""We want to play!""\n\n""Alas,"" Broggo said with great disappointment, ""I don't have any cards or dice or clay chips. I left them in my wagon, back with my traveling companions. And I don't know where the wagon is.""\n\n""No problem!"" said the first spirit.\n\n""We can show you where the wagon has gone!""\n\nAnd that's just what the spirits did. Of course, they weren't happy when Broggo, reunited with his companions, drove off the spirits. As the wagon rolled out of the Haunted Wood, Broggo pulled out a journal and started writing.\n\n""What are you doing?"" asked one of his traveling companions.\n\n""I had the best idea for a game this evening. I want to write it down while the memory is fresh."""

But when we Nords were told by our jarls that we were allied with Dark Elves and their pets, the lizardfolk, I joined the rebellion.\n\nAnd in doing so, knowing we were now traitors to our own leaders, I decided to invoke the power of the wolf.\n\nOn the night of a new moon, I piled branches atop a hill to summon it with a bonfire.

They tumbled from my lips as I prepared to set my pyre ablaze.\n\nI saw it. I always saw it. Through the smoke, the wolf gained a more corporeal shape, its eyes as red as embers.\n\n""Wolf!

msgid "By Porbert Lyttumly\n\nYana was precisely the kind of student her mentor Arthcamu despised: the professional amateur. He enjoyed all the criminal types who were his usual pupils at the stronghold, from the common burglar to the more sophisticated blackmailers, children, and young people with strong career ambitions which the art and science of lockpicking could facilitate. They were always interested in simple solutions, the easy way, but people like Yana were always looking for exceptions, possibilities, exotica. For pragmatists like Arthcamu, it was intensely vexing.\n\nThe Redguard maiden would spend hours in front of a lock, prodding at it with her wires and picks, flirting with the key pins and driver pins, exploring the hull with a sort of casual fascination that no delinquent possesses. Long after her fellow students had opened their test locks and moved on, Yana was still playing with hers. The fact that she always opened it eventually, no matter how advanced a lock it was, irked Arthcamu even further.\n\n""You are making things much too difficult,"" he would roar, boxing her ears. ""Speed is of the essence, not merely technical know-how. I swear that if I put the key to the lock right in front of you, you'd still never get around to opening it.""\n\nYana would bear Arthcamu's abuse philosophically. She had, after all, paid him in advance. Speed was doubtless an important factor for the picker trying to get somewhere he wasn't supposed to go with the city guard on patrol behind him, but Yana knew it wouldn't apply to her. She merely wanted the knowledge.\n\nArthcamu did everything he could think of to encourage Yana to move faster. She seemed to perversely thrive on his physical and verbal blows, spending more and more time on each lock, learning its idiosyncrasies and personality. Finally, he could bear it no longer. Very late one afternoon after Yana had dawdled over a perfectly ordinary lock, he grabbed the girl by her ear and dragged her to a room in the stronghold far from the other students, an area they had always been forbidden to visit.\n\nThe room was completely barren, except for one large crate in the center. There were no windows and no other door except for the one leading in. Arthcamu slammed his student against the crate and closed the door behind her. There was a distinct click of the lock.\n\n""This is the test for my advanced students,"" he laughed behind the door. ""See if you can escape.""\n\nYana smiled and began her usual slow process of massaging the lock, gaining information. After a few minutes had gone by, she heard Arthcamu's voice again call out from behind the door. ""Perhaps I should mention that this is a test of speed. You see the crate behind you? It contains a vampire ancient who has been locked in here for many months. It is absolutely ravenous. In a few minutes' time, the sun will have completely set, and if you have not opened the door, you will be nothing but a bloodless husk.""\n\nYana considered only for a moment whether Arthcamu was joking or not. She knew he was an evil, horrible man, but to resort to murder to teach his pupil? The moment she heard a rustling in the crate, any doubts she had were erased. Ignoring all her usual explorations, she jammed her wire into the lock, thrust the pegs against the pressure plate, and shoved open the door.\n\nArthcamu stood in the hallway beyond, laughing cruelly, ""So, now you've learned the value of fast work.""\n\nYana fled from Arthcamu's stronghold, fighting back her tears. He was certain that she would never return to his tutelage, but he considered that he had taught her at last a very valuable lesson. When she did return the next morning, Arthcamu registered no surprise, but inside he was seething.\n\n""I'll be leaving shortly,"" she explained, quietly. ""But I believe I've developed a new type of lock, and I'd be grateful if you'd give me your opinion of it.""\n\nArthcamu shrugged and asked her to present her design.\n\n""I was wondering if I might use the vampire room and install the lock. I think it would be better if I demonstrated it.""\n\nArthcamu was dubious, but the prospect of the tiresome girl leaving at last put him in an excellent and even indulgent mood. He agreed to give her access to the room. For all morning and most of the afternoon, she worked near the slumbering vampire, removing the old lock and adding her new prototype. Finally, she asked her old master to take a look."

msgid "By Narsis Dren, Treasure Hunter\n\nI discovered this section of ruins after careful study of the surrounding countryside. To my trained and experienced eyes, it was obvious that this complex would be right where I found it. I dubbed the place ""Lower Bthanual,"" due to its proximity and relative elevation compared to the nearby Bthanual ruins. As with all Dwemer installations, the true purpose of the place eludes me. But that doesn't mean I can't dream and make a few wild guesses.\n\nAnd, as always, my wild guesses will be closer to the truth than any theories proposed by the so-called scholars who sit in their towers in Mournhold and the Mages Guildhalls.\n\nAs I studied the maps I had drawn of the complex, an idea began to form at the back of my mind. I decided to sleep on it, and I found a safe location that the spiders and spheres seemed to actively avoid. I fell asleep to the gentle whirring of gears and the hiss of steam, and in my sleep, I dreamed.\n\nI dreamed I was standing in the smaller, southern chamber, surrounded by living, breathing Dwemer. They were so engaged in their work that they didn't notice me as I passed among them. I watched as they fed strange components of metal and other, less easily identifiable substances into the maws of their churning machinery. They didn't speak or pause to rest, and they seemed to me to be almost as mechanical as the gadgets they produced.\n\nIn my dream, I left the Dwemer workers to their incomprehensible tasks and exited by the eastern corridor. I followed the passage as it curved to the north, ignoring the spheres that rolled past me. In the larger chamber, I came upon a bizarre scene. Dozens of Dwemer were crowded around the central platform, intent upon whatever was taking place upon that raised stage. I could see one of the centurions upon the platform, as it stood much taller than the Dwemer crowded around it. But I couldn't make out what was happening that had the Dwemer so fascinated. I started to push my way through the crowd in order to get a better view, when something grabbed my arm. \n\nI thought it must have been one of the Dwemer, who had until this moment completely ignored my presence, but the hand that grabbed me was cold and metallic. When it squeezed, I cried out in pain and opened my eyes. The dream rolled away like a parting mist, and I found myself in the grip of a Dwemer Spider! \n\nWell, since you're reading this account, you must have realized by now that I escaped that deadly danger, just as I always do. With style and wit and panache. You would have been amazed!\n\nBut let me tell you what I found when I opened the chest I stumbled across in the darkest shadows of the far corner of the chamber. The chest appeared a more recent addition to the ruins, not Dwemer in style or function at all. Made me think that maybe I hadn't been the first explorer to discover this site after all. Trust me when I tell you, however, that the contents of the out-of-place chest were almost as remarkable as yours truly, Narsis Dren—Treasure Hunter!"

msgid "By Porbert Lyttumly\n\nArthcamu was dubious, but the prospect of the tiresome girl leaving at last put him in an excellent and even indulgent mood. He agreed to give her access to the room. For all morning and most of the afternoon, she worked near the slumbering vampire, removing the old lock and adding her new prototype. Finally, she asked her old master to take a look.\n\nHe studied the lock with an expert eye, and found little to be impressed with.\n\n""This is the first and only pick-proof lock,"" Yana explained. ""The only way to open it is to have the right key.""\n\nArthcamu scoffed and let Yana close the door, shutting him in the room. The door clicked and he began to go to work. To his dismay, the lock was much more difficult than he thought it would be. He tried all his methods to force it, and found that he had to resort to his hated student's method of careful and thorough exploration.\n\n""I need to leave now,"" called Yana from the other side of the door. ""I'm going to bring the city guard to the stronghold. I know that it's against the rules, but I really think it's for the welfare of the villagers not to have a hungry vampire on the loose. It's getting dark, and even though you aren't able to unlock the door, the vampire might be less proud about using the key to escape. Remember when you said 'If I put the key to the lock right in front of you, you'd still never get around to opening it'?""\n\n""Wait!"" Arthcamu yelled back. ""I'll use the key! Where is it? You forgot to give it to me!""\n\nBut there was no reply, only the sound of footfall disappearing down the corridor beyond the door. Arthcamu began to work harder on the lock, but his hands were shaking with fear. With no windows, it was impossible to tell how late it was getting to be. Were minutes that were flying by or hours? He only knew that the vampire ancient would know.\n\nThe tools could not stand very much twisting and tapping from Arthcamu's hysterical hands. The wire snapped in the keyhole. Just like a student. Arthcamu screamed and pounded on the door, but he knew that no one could possibly hear him. It was while sucking in his breath to scream again, he heard the distinct creak of the crate opening behind him.\n\nThe vampire ancient regarded the master locksmith with insane, hungry eyes, and flew at him in a frenzy. Before Arthcamu died, he saw it: on a chain that had been placed around the vampire's neck while it had been sleeping was a key."

msgid "Except … it seemed I heard a faint hiss, regular as breathing. I fought down a sudden surge of panic. I was unarmed, not thinking of danger in my haste to explore past the blocked passage. Sweat dripped down my face as I scanned the gloom for any movement. The room was warm, I suddenly noticed, much warmer than the rest of the labyrinth thus far. My excitement returned. Could I have found a section of the city still connected to a functioning steam grid? Pipes ran along the walls, as in all sections of the city. I walked over and placed my hand on one. It was hot, almost too hot to touch! Now I saw that in places where the ancient piping had corroded, small jets of steam were escaping - the sound I had heard. I laughed at my own credulity.\n\nI now advanced quickly to the far end of the room, giving a cheerful salute to the ranks of mechanical soldiers who had appeared so menacing only moments before. I smiled with triumph as the light swept back the darkness of centuries to reveal the giant effigy of a Dwarven king standing on a raised dais, his metal hand clutching his rod of office. This was the prize indeed! I circled the dais slowly, admiring the craftsmanship of the ancient Dwarves. The golden king stood twenty feet tall under a freestanding domed cupola, his long upswept beard jutting forward proudly as his glittering metal eyes seemed to follow me. But my superstitious mood had passed, and I gazed benevolently on the old Dwarven king. My king, as I had already begun to think of him. I stepped onto the dais to get a better look at the sculpted armor. Suddenly the eyes of the figure opened and it raised a mailed fist to strike!\n\nI leaped to one side as the golden arm came crashing down, striking sparks from the steps where I had stood a moment before. With a hiss of steam and the whir of gears, the giant figure stepped ponderously out from under its canopy and strode towards me with frightening speed, its eyes tracking me as I scrambled backwards. I dodged behind a pillar as the fist whistled down again. I had dropped my lantern in the confusion, and now I crept into the darkness outside the pool of light, hoping to slip between the headless mechanisms and thus escape back to the safety of the passageway. Where had the monster gone? You would think that a twenty-foot golden king would be hard to miss, but he was nowhere to be seen. The guttering lamp only illuminated a small part of the room. He could be hiding anywhere in the gloom. I crawled faster. Without warning, the dim ranks of Dwarven soldiers in front of me went flying as the monstrous guardian loomed before me. He had cut off my escape! As I dodged backwards, blow after blow whistled down as the implacable machine followed me relentlessly, driving me into the far corner of the room. At last there was nowhere left for me to go. My back was to the wall. I glared up at my foe, determined to die on my feet. The huge fists lifted for one final blow.\n\nThe room blazed with sudden light. Bolts of purple energy crackled across the metal carapace of the Dwarven monster, and it halted, half-turning to meet this new threat. Master Arum had come! I was about to raise a cheer when the giant figure turned back to me, unharmed by the lightning bolt hurled by Master Arum, determined to destroy this first intruder. I shouted out ""Steam! Steam!"" as the giant raised his fist to crush me into the floor. There was a hiss and a gust of bitter cold and I looked up. The monster was now covered with a shell of ice, frozen in the very moment of dispatching me. Master Arum had understood. I leaned against the wall with relief.\n\nThe ice cracked above me. The giant golden king stood before me, the shell of ice falling away, his head swiveling towards me in triumph. Was there no stopping this Dwarven monstrosity? But then the light faded from his eyes, and his arms dropped to his sides. The magical frost had worked, cooling its steam-driven energy.\n\nAs Master Arum and the diggers crowded around me, congratulating me on my narrow escape, my thoughts drifted. I imagined my return to the Imperial City, and I knew that this would be my greatest triumph yet. How could I possibly top this find? Perhaps it was time to move on. Recovering the fabled Eye of Argonia…now that would be a coup! I smiled to myself, reveling in the glory of the moment but already planning my next adventure."

msgid "by Anthil Morvir\n\nA One Act Play, Part 2\n\nDramatis Personae:\n\nMalvasian: A High Elf battlemage\nInzoliah: A Dark Elf battlemage\nSome bandits\nScene: Eldenwood\n\nMalvasian and Inzoliah pause for a moment before continuing as a fearful wail pierces the air. When it dies away, they slowly trudge on.\n\nINZOLIAH: Just as an intellectual exercise, I wonder what spell you would cast at me if we made it out of here without any more combat.\n\nMALVASIAN: I hope you're not implying that I would dream of killing you so I would keep the treasure all to myself.\n\nINZOLIAH: Of course not, nor would I do that to you. It is merely an intellectual exercise.\n\nMALVASIAN: Well, in that case, purely as an intellectual exercise, I would probably cast a leech spell on you, to take away your life force and heal myself. After all, there are brigands on the road between here and Silvenar, and a wounded battlemage with a valuable artifact would make a tempting target. I'd hate to survive Elden Grove merely to die in the open.\n\nINZOLIAH: That's a well-reasoned response. As for myself, again, not saying I would ever do this, but I think a simple, sudden electrical bolt would serve my purposes admirably. I agree about the danger of brigands, but don't forget, we also have a potion of healing. I could easily slay you and heal myself to full capacity.\n\nMALVASIAN: Very true. It would end up a question then of whose spell was more effective at that instant. If our spells counteracted one another and I leeched your life energy only to be crippled by your lightning bolt, then we could both be killed. Or so near death that a mere potion of healing would scarcely help either one of us, let alone both. How ironic it would be if two scheming battlemages, not saying we are scheming but for the purpose of this intellectual exercise, were left on the brink of death, completely drained of magicka, with one healing potion to choose from. Who would get it then?\n\nINZOLIAH: Logically, whoever drank it first, which in this case would be you since you're holding it. Now, what if one of us were injured, but not killed?\n\nMALVASIAN: Logic would dictate that a scheming battlemage would take the potion, leaving the injured party to the mercy of the elements, I suppose.\n\nINZOLIAH: That does seem most sensible. But suppose that the battlemages, while certainly scheming types, had a certain respect for one another. Perhaps in that case, the victorious one might, for instance, put the potion up a tree near his or her gravely wounded victim. Then when the wounded party had enough magicka replenished, he or she would be able to levitate to the tree branches and recover the potion. By that time, the victorious battlemage would have already collected the reward.\n\nThey pause for a moment at the sound of something in the bushes nearby. Carefully, they climb across the branches of a tree to bypass it.\n\nMALVASIAN: I understand what you're saying, but it seems out of character for our hypothetic scheming battlemage to allow his or her victim to live.\n\nINZOLIAH: Perhaps. But it's been my observation that most scheming battlemages enjoy the feeling of having bested someone in combat, and having that person alive to live with the humiliation.\n\nMALVASIAN: These hypothetical scheming battlemages sound … (excitedly) Daylight! Do you see it?\n\nThe two scurry across the branch dropping behind a bush, so we can no longer see them. We can, however, see the shimmering halo of sunlight.\n\nMALVASIAN (behind the tall bush): We made it.\n\nINZOLIAH (likewise, behind the tall bush): Indeed.\n\nThere is a sudden explosion of electrical energy and a wild howling aura of red light, and then silence. After a few moment's pause, we hear someone climbing up the tree. It is Malvasian, putting the potion high up in the boughs. He chuckles as he climbs back down and the curtain drops.\n\nEpilogue.\n\nThe curtain rises on a road to Silvenar. A gang of bandits have surrounded Malvasian, who is propped up on his staff, barely able to stand. They pull his chest away from him with ease.\n\nBANDIT #1: What have we got here? Don't you know it ain't safe to be out on the road, all sick like you are? Why don't we help you with your load?\n\nMALVASIAN (weakly): Please … let me be ….\n\nBANDIT #2: Go on, spellcaster, fight us for it!\n\nMALVASIAN: I can't … too weak ….\n\nSuddenly, Inzoliah flies in, casting lightning bolts from her fingers at the bandits, who quickly scramble away. She lands on the ground and picks up the chest. Malvasian collapses, dying.\n\nMALVASIAN: Hypothetically, what if …  a battlemage cast a spell on another which didn't harm him at once, but … drained his life force and his magicka, bit by bit, so he wouldn't know at the time, but … feel confident enough to leave the potion of healing behind?\n\nINZOLIAH: A most treacherous battlemage she'd be.\n\nMALVASIAN: And … hypothetically … would she be likely to help her fallen foe … so that she could enjoy the humiliation of him continuing … to live?\n\nINZOLIAH: From my experience, hypothetically, no. She doesn't sound like a fool.\n\nAs Inzoliah lugs the chest off toward Silvenar, and Malvasian expires on the stage, we drop the curtain."

msgid "A Moon-Singer Story of the Hero Khunzar-ri.\n\nIn the time before time, when the sixteen kingdoms were barely more than sixteen prides, the great hero Khunzar-ri met a demon on the border of Elsweyr.\n\nThe demon, whose name was Kaalgrontiid, proclaimed in a powerful voice, ""My brothers and I shall take this land. Its treasures and even the moons above will be ours!""\n\n""I do not think so, foul demon,"" Khunzar-ri said. ""Elsweyr and all it contains, even the moons above, are under my protection.""\n\nThe demon laughed. ""You cannot stop us, little cat-thing! You are nothing but soft flesh and fur, while we are scales and teeth and claws!""\n\nKhunzar-ri thought for a moment. ""Perhaps you are right, oh massive demon. You are certainly too much for even my prodigious strength."" Then he thought to himself, ""That is why I shall gather a Kra'Jun, a company of heroes. Together, we will find a way to stop you, foul demon!""\n\nSo, while the demons ravaged Elsweyr and chased the moons through the sky, Khunzar-ri went on a quest to form his Kra'Jun. He gathered the greatest champions of the age and convinced them to do what they had never done before—work together. He called to his side the Altmer, Nurarion the Perfect, who wielded the Subtle Blade. He coerced Flinthild Demon-Hunter to leave her castle in the far north. He used sweet words and flattered Anequina Sharp-Tongue, queen and moon-priest of the Ne Quin-al pride, until she agreed to stand beside him. Finally, Khunzar-ri asked he who would become the Betrayer to lend him his sword, for there was no finer warrior in all the land.\n\nWith the Kra'Jun assembled, Khunzar-ri and his companions set forth to defeat Kaalgrontiid and his demon brothers. For forty-one days and forty-one nights, great and terrible battles raged across Elsweyr. The Kra'Jun won some of these battles and they lost some of these battles, but they could not find a way to kill or drive off the demons. It was he who would become the Betrayer who eventually made the suggestion. ""The demons seek to consume the moons. Why not let them have them? Or, to be more precise, let them think we have surrendered and acquiesced to their plans.""\n\n""A brilliant idea!"" Khunzar-ri concurred. ""But instead of consuming the moons, we let the moons steal the life from them!""\n\nAnequina the moon-priest nodded in understanding. ""This one can do that. This one can talk to Jone and Jode and ask them to consume the demons.""\n\nThen, Khunzar-ri used every bit of guile and charm he possessed to convince the demons that the Kra'Jun was now willing to help them. He told them where to meet, at a moon temple of renown, and waited while Anequina communed with the moons. ""It is not in the nature of Jone and Jode to fully consume the demons,"" Anequina said, ""but Jode will take enough of their life force to weaken them. That should allow us to contain them.""\n\n""I know just the place,"" proclaimed Nurarion the Perfect. ""An ancient place of power, forgotten and long abandoned. We can trap the demons there.""\n\nKhunzar-ri was proud of the wisdom of his Kra'Jun, but he needed a way to lure the weakened demons into the trap. They had to enter the place of their own accord, for even weakened demons were too dangerous for the Kra'Jun to deal with. So Anequina and Flinthild put their heads together and devised a plan. They told Khunzar-ri, and he smiled and twitched his tail. ""Fragrant!"" he said.\n\nSo the demons arrived at the moon temple and Anequina, acting as moon-priest instead of queen, opened a connection between Nirn and Jode in the form of a shaft of moonlight. The demons, greedy and hungry for lunar power, eagerly stepped into the moonlight, but immediately realized they had been tricked. They roared in pain as a portion of their life force was drawn away by Jode. It took Kaalgrontiid every bit of his remaining strength, but he resisted and rallied his brothers. They broke free of the shaft of treacherous moonlight and fled into the wilderness.\n\nAnequina then deposited a sliver of the demon-infused moonlight in an urn and gave it to Flinthild. Flinthild and the Kra'Jun took the urn to the ancient place of power, while Khunzar-ri went to do what he did best: convince the demons to follow the lure and walk into the trap of their own free will. And that is what he did, before the Betrayer earned his name. As you shall hear.\n\nThese are the words, and the words are true."

msgid "2920: The Last Year of the First Era\n\nBy Carlovac Townway\n\n19 Mid Year, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\n\nThe Potentate arrived in the Imperial City amid great fanfare, the streets lined with men and women cheering him as the symbol of the taking of Ald Marak. Truth be told, a greater number would have turned out had the Prince returned, and the Versidue-Shaie knew it. Still, it pleased him to no end. Never before had citizens of Tamriel cheered the arrival of an Akaviri into their land.\n\nThe Emperor Reman III greeted him with a warm embrace, and then tore into the letter he had brought from the Prince.\n\n""I don't understand,"" he said at last, still joyous but equally confused. ""You went under the lake?""\n\n""Ald Marak is a very well-fortified fortress,"" explained the Potentate. ""As, I might add, the army of Morrowind has rediscovered, now that they are on the outside. To take it, we had to attack by surprise and with our soldiery in the sturdiest of armor. By casting the spell that allowed us to breathe underwater, we were able to travel faster than Vivec would have guessed, the weight of the armor made less by the aquatic surroundings, and attack from the waterbound west side of the fortress where their defenses were at their weakest.""\n\n""Brilliant!"" the Emperor crowed. ""You are a wonderous tactician, Versidue-Shaie! If your fathers had been as good at this as you are, Tamriel would be Akaviri domain!""\n\nThe Potentate had not planned to take credit for Prince Juilek's design, but on the Emperor's reference to his people's fiasco of an invasion two hundred and sixteen years before, he made up his mind. He smiled modestly and soaked up the praise.\n\n21 Mid Year, 2920\nAld Marak, Morrowind\n\nSavirien-Chorak slithered to the wall and watched through the arrow slit the Morrowind army retreating back to the forestland between the swamps and the castle grounds. It seemed like the idea opportunity to strike. Perhaps the forests could be burned and the army within them. Perhaps with Vivec in their enemies' hands, the army would allow them possession of Ald Iuval as well. He suggested these ideas to the Prince.\n\n""What you seem to be forgetting,"" laughed Prince Juilek, ""is that I gave my word that no harm to the army or to their commanders during the truce negotiations. Do you not have honor during warfare on Akavir?""\n\n""My Prince, I was born here in Tamriel, I have never been to my people's home,"" replied the snake man. ""But even so, your ways are strange to me. You expected no quarter and I gave you none when we fought in the Imperial Arena five months ago.""\n\n""That was a game,"" replied the Prince, before nodding to his steward to let the Dunmer battle chief in.\n\nJuilek had never seen Vivec before, but he had heard he was a living god. What came before him was but a man. A powerfully built man, handsome, with an intelligent face, but a man nonetheless. The Prince was pleased: a man he could speak with, but not a god.\n\n""Greetings, my worthy adversary,"" said Vivec. ""We seem to be at an impasse.""\n\n""Not necessarily,"" said the Prince. ""You don't want to give us Morrowind, and I can't fault you for that. But I must have your coastline to protect the Empire from overseas aggressions, and certain key strategic border castles, such as this one, as well as Ald Umbeil, Tel Aruhn, Ald Lambasi, and Tel Mothrivra.""\n\n""And in return?"" asked Vivec.\n\n""In return?"" laughed Savirien-Chorak. ""You forget we are the victors here, not you.""\n\n""In return,"" said Prince Juilek carefully. ""There will be no Imperial attacks on Morrowind, unless in return to an attack by you. You will be protected from invaders by the Imperial Navy. And your land may expand by taking certain estates in Black Marsh, whichever you choose, provided they are not needed by the Empire.""\n\n""A reasonable offer,"" said Vivec after a pause. ""You must forgive me, I am unused to Cyrodiils who offer something in return for what they take. May I have a few days to decide?""\n\n""We will meet again in a week's time,"" said the Prince, smiling. ""In the meantime, if your army provokes no attacks on mine, we are at peace.""\n\nVivec left the Prince's chamber, feeling that Almalexia was right. The war was at an end. This Prince would make an excellent Emperor."

""I have not seen you lately. I thought perhaps you were … indisposed with the lovely Rijja.""\n\n""She's taking the baths at Mir Corrup,"" the Emperor Reman III said miserably.\n\n""Please, come in.""\n\n""I've reached the stage where I can only trust three people: you, my son the Prince, and Rijja,"" said the Emperor petulantly. ""My entire council is nothing but a pack of spies.""\n\n""What seems to be the matter, Your Imperial Majesty?"" asked the Potentate Versidue-Shaie sympathetically, drawing closed the thick curtain in his chamber. Instantly all sound outside the room was extinguished, echoing footsteps in the marble halls and birds in the springtide gardens.\n\n""I've discovered that a notorious poisoner, an Orma tribeswoman from Black Marsh called Catchica, was with the army at Caer Suvio while we were encamped there when my son was poisoned, before the battle at Bodrum. I'm sure she would have preferred to kill me, but the opportunity didn't present itself,"" The Emperor fumed. ""The Council suggests that we need evidence of her involvement before we prosecute.""\n\n""Of course they would,"" said the Potentate thoughtfully. ""Particularly if one or more of them was in on the plot. I have a thought, Your Imperial Majesty.""\n\n""Yes?"" said Reman impatiently. ""Out with it!""\n\n""Tell the Council you're dropping the matter, and I will send out the Guard to track this Catchica down and follow her. We will see who her friends are, and perhaps get an idea of the scope of this plot on Your Imperial Majesty's life.""\n\n""Yes,"" said Reman with a satisfied frown. ""That's a capital plan. We will track this scheme to whomever it leads to.""\n\n""Decidedly, Your Imperial Majesty,"" smiled the Potentate, parting the curtain so the Emperor could leave. In the hallway outside was Versidue-Shaie's son, Savirien-Chorak. The boy bowed to the Emperor before entering the Potentate's chamber.\n\n""Are you in trouble, father?"" whispered the Akaviri lad. ""I heard the Emperor found out about whatshername, the poisoner.""\n\n""The great art of speechcraft, my boy,"" said Versidue-Shaie to his son. ""Is to tell them what they want to hear in a way that gets them to do what you want them to do. I need you to get a letter to Catchica, and make certain that she understands that if she does not follow the instructions perfectly, she is risking her own life more than ours.""\n\n13 Second Seed, 2920\nMir Corrup, Cyrodiil\n\nRijja sank luxuriantly into the burbling hot spring, feeling her skin tingle like it was being rubbed by millions of little stones. The rock shelf over her head sheltered her from the misting rain, but let all the sunshine in, streaming in layers through the branches of the trees. It was an idyllic moment in an idyllic life, and when she was finished she knew that her beauty would be entirely restored. The only thing she needed was a drink of water. The bath itself, while wonderfully fragrant, tasted always of chalk.\n\n""Water!"" she cried to her servants. ""Water, please!""\n\nA gaunt woman with rags tied over her eyes ran to her side and dropped a goatskin of water. Rijja was about to laugh at the woman's prudery—she herself was not ashamed of her naked body—but then she noticed through a crease in the rags that the old woman had no eyes at all. She was like one of those Orma tribesmen Rijja had heard about, but never met. Born without eyes, they were masters of their other senses. The Lord of Mir Corrup hired very exotic servants, she thought to herself.\n\nIn a moment, the woman was gone and forgotten. Rijja found it very hard to concentrate on anything but the sun and the water. She opened the cork, but the liquid within had a strange, metallic smell to it. Suddenly, she was aware that she was not alone.\n\n""Lady Rijja,"" said the Captain of the Imperial Guard. ""You are, I see, acquainted with Catchica?""\n\n""I've never heard of her,"" stammered Rijja before becoming indignant. ""What are you doing here? This body is not for your leering eyes.""\n\n""Never heard of her, when we saw her with you not a minute ago,"" said the captain, picking up the goatskin and smelling it. ""Brought you neivous ichor, did she? To poison the Emperor with?""\n\n""Captain,"" said one of the guards, running up to him quickly. ""We cannot find the Argonian. It is as if she disappeared into the woods.""\n\n""Yes, they're good at that,"" said the captain. ""No matter though. We've got her contact at court. That should please His Imperial Majesty. Seize her.""\n\nAs the guards pulled the writhing naked woman from the pool, she screamed, ""I'm innocent! I don't know what this is all about, but I've done nothing! The Emperor will have your heads for this!""\n\n""Yes, I imagine he will,"" smiled the captain. ""If he trusts you."""

msgid """Very well,"" Mazaram sighed. He explained that one of his agents—for Mazaram made his money in shipping—told him of a nearby land without a ruler. ""It is far greater than this village, yet shines like a pearl in the darkness. A place to which you can lay claim, but that you'll never reach without my agent's aid.""\n\nAzelit-ra laughed scornfully, ""No such land exists! Is this some crude ploy to get me out of the way while you marry my daughter? Fah! I'll not fall for your tricks!""\n\n""It is no trick, step-father,"" Munilli asserted. ""On my mother's honor, I have seen this land—as have you! It is renowned for its beauty in story and song!""\n\nAt this, Azelit-ra was taken aback. As much as he knew Munilli wished to marry Mazaram, he also knew her as a truthful girl … and she valued her late mother's honor as much as her own life. But still he doubted, for an untrustworthy man does not trust easily.\n\n""Very well. What is this great land of which you speak, that I have seen yet do not know?""\n\nMazaram waggled one finger, ""No, no … if I tell you freely, how do I know you won't try to conquer it without me? I insist you'll need my agent's help, but you might try something foolish on your own.""\n\n""Very well,"" Azelit-ra harrumphed. ""If you won't tell me, then how will I know you speak the truth?""\n\n""My agent,"" Mazaram replied, ""will take you there tonight. If he does so, will you agree I've met the bride-price?""\n\n'A ruse,' thought the greedy step-father. 'They hope to escape while I prepare for my ""journey"" to this land of theirs. Well, I can fix them!'\n\n""Agreed!"" Azelit-ra exclaimed, much to the surprise of the servants around him. ""But I insist if we're to go on a journey, we must have your engagement feast beforehand! You, Mazaram, shall sit upon my right and Munilli shall sit upon my left!""\n\n'Ha,' he thought, 'try to escape while you're in arm's reach!'\n\nBut the two agreed. Azelit-ra had no choice but to open his larder and wine cellar to the entire village. They feasted all afternoon. As was his habit, the plantation owner ate greedily, making sure no one else got more than he. The couple ate sparingly and never moved from his side. Soon, Azelit-ra grew sleepy, and then annoyed.\n\n""The moons are rising, Mazaram! Where is this agent of yours?"" he asked.\n\n""I am right behind you, my lord,"" a voice purred in Azelit-ra's ear.\n\nThe old man jumped, but quickly recovered. When he turned, he saw what looked like a vagabond in a wide-brimmed hat. The traveler's tail twitched, but whether it was with nervousness or amusement, Azelit-ra could not tell.\n\n""Well, then, where is this land of yours!"" Azelit-ra bellowed at the man. ""I'm ready to go … or to see the back of you and Mazaram both!""\n\n""You are ready?"" the vagabond asked. ""Then let us go now!"" With a flash, the vagabond discarded his wide-brimmed hat. There stood Rajhin the Trickster God in all his glory. Without another word, Rajhin seized the fat man by his stained tunic and the two flew upward like shooting stars. Soon, their glow disappeared into the pearl-wide aura of Jode, the largest moon.\n\n""Truly,"" Munilli mused aloud, ""it is a land we can see from our village.""\n\n""And one that shines as beautiful as a pearl.""\n\nWhen the villagers recovered from their shock, the engagement feast turned into a wedding feast. By the time both moons had set, Mazaram and Munilli were married.\n\nBut as they lay in their bower, a chill overcame both of them. The candles guttered. The darkness grew. Munilli cried out, and Mazaram groped in the dark for his sword.\n\nSuddenly, there was a flash of light. Rajhin stood before them, brushing moon-dust off his garments. ""Now, then, where are you?"" he mused as the two lovers gaped. ""Ah, there you are!""\n\nWith a movement too quick for the eye to follow, Rajhin reached out and grabbed at the air. Then he shoved his hand into one of the many small pouches on his person. The room grew light once more.\n\n""What was that, my lord? What did you seize?"" Munilli asked.\n\n""The fat man's shadow! I took him to his new land so quickly, he jumped right out of it!""\n\nTheir laughter echoed across the riverbank."

msgid "By Anonymous\n\nThe last time I saw the old Argonian, I was taken by how alive he seemed, even though he was in the throes of death.\n \n""The secret,"" he said, ""of staying alive … is not in running away, but swimming directly at danger. Catches it off-guard.""\n \n""Is that how you managed to find this claw?"" I asked, brandishing the small carving as if it were a weapon. I had found it among his possessions, which I was helping him to divvy amongst his beneficiaries. ""Should it also go to your cousin? Dives-from-Below?""\n \nAt this, his mouth widened, exposing his fangs. If I hadn't known him as long as I had I would think he was snarling, but I knew that to be a smile. He croaked a few times to attempt laughter, but ended up wheezing and coughing, his rancid blood spraying across the bedsheets.\n \n""Do you know what that is?"" he asked between coughing fits.\n \n""I've heard stories,"" I answered, ""the same as you. Looks like one of the claws, for opening the sealing-doors in the ancient crypts. I've never seen one myself, before.""\n \n""Then you know I would only wish that thing upon a mortal enemy. Giving it to my cousin would just be encouraging him to run into one of those barrows and get split by a draugr blade.""\n \n""So you want me to have it, then?"" I joked. ""Where did you even get this?""\n \n""My kind can find things that your people assumed were gone. Drop something to the bottom of a lake, and a Nord will never see it again. Amazing what you can find along the bottoms.""\n \nHe was staring at the ceiling now, and but the way his fogged eyes darted around, I could tell he was seeing his memories instead of the cracked stone above us.\n \n""Did you ever try to use it?"" I whispered to him, hoping he could hear me through his fog.\n \n""Of course!"" he snapped, suddenly lucid. His eyes widened and fixed on me. ""Where do you think I got this?"" he barked, tearing his tunic open to show a white scar forming a large star-shaped knot in the scales beneath his right shoulder. ""Blasted draugr got the drop on me. Just too many of them.""\n \nI felt awful, since I knew how much he hated talking about the battles he had been in. To him, it was enough that he had survived, and any stories would amount to boasting. We both sat quietly for several minutes, his labored breathing the only sound.\n \nHe was the one to break the silence. ""You know what always bothered me?"" he asked. ""Why they even bothered with the symbols.""\n \n""The what?""\n \n""The symbols, you fool, look at the claw.""\n \nI turned it over in my hand. Sure enough, etched into the face were three animals. A bear, an owl, and some kind of insect.\n \n""What do the symbols mean, Deerkaza?""\n \n""The sealing-doors. It's not enough to just have the claw. They're made of massive stone wheels that must align with the claw's symbols before they'll open. It's a sort of lock, I suppose. But I didn't know why they bothered with them. If you had the claw, you also had the symbols to open the door. So why …""\n \nHe was broken up by a coughing fit. It was the most I had heard him speak in months, but I could tell how much of a struggle it was. I knew his mind, though, and helped the thought along.\n \n""Why even have a combination if you're going to write it on the key?""\n \n""Exactly. But as I lay bleeding on that floor, I figured it out. The draugr are relentless, but far from clever. Once I was downed, they continued shuffling about. To no aim. No direction. Bumping against one another, the walls.""\n \n""So?""\n \n""So the symbols on the doors weren't meant to be another lock. Just a way of ensuring the person entering was actually alive and had a functioning mind.""\n \n""Then the doors ….""\n \n""Were never meant to keep people out. They were meant to keep the draugr in.""\n \nAnd with that, he fell back asleep. When he awoke several days later, he refused to talk about the draugr at all, and would only wince and clutch his shoulder if I tried to bring them up."

All the young priestesses smiled and made faces of astonishment, but the truth was that Corda's sister Rijja wrote very often, at least once a month.\n\nCorda took the letter to the garden to read it, her favorite place, an oasis in the monochromatic sand-colored world of the conservatorium The letter itself was nothing unusual: filled with court gossip, the latest fashions which were tending to winedark velvets, and reports of the Emperor's ever-growing paranoia.\n\n""You are so lucky to be away from all of this,"" wrote Rijja. ""The Emperor is convinced that his latest battlefield fiasco is all a result of spies in the palace. He has even taken to questioning me. Ruptga keep it so you never have a life as interesting as mine.""\n\nCorda listened to the sounds of the desert and prayed to Ruptga the exact opposite wish.\n\n3 Rain's Hand, 2920\nColdharbour, Oblivion\n\nSotha Sil proceeded as quickly as he could through the blackened halls of the palace, half-submerged in brackish water. All around him, nasty gelatinous creatures scurried into the reeds, bursts of white fire lit up the upper arches of the hall before disappearing, and smells assaulted him, rancid death one moment, sweet flowered perfume the next. Several times he had visited the Daedra princes in their Oblivion, but every time, something different awaited him.\n\nHe knew his purpose, and refused to be distracted.\n\nEight of the more prominent Daedra princes were awaiting him in the half-melted, domed room. Azura, Prince of Dusk and Dawn; Boethiah, Prince of Plots; Herma-Mora, Daedra of Knowledge; Hircine, the Hunter; Malacath, God of Curses; Mehrunes Dagon, Prince of Disaster; Molag Bal, Prince of Rage; Sheogorath, the Mad One.\n\nAbove them, the sky cast tormented shadows upon the meeting.\n\n5 Rain's Hand, 2920\nThe Isle of Artaeum, Summurset\n\nSotha Sil's voice cried out, echoing from the cave, ""Move the rock!""\n\nImmediately, the initiates obeyed, rolling aside the great boulder that blocked the entrance to the Dreaming Cavern. Sotha Sil emerged, his face smeared with ash, weary. He felt he had been away for months, years, but only a few days had transpired. Lilatha took his arm to help him walk, but he refused her help with a kind smile and a shake of his head.\n\n""Were you … successful?"" she asked.\n\n""The Daedra princes I spoke with have agreed to our terms,"" he said flatly. ""Disasters such as befell Gilverdale should be averted. Only through certain intermediaries such as witches or sorcerers will they answer the call of man and mer.""\n\n""And what did you promise them in return?"" asked the Nord boy Welleg.\n\n""The deals we make with Daedra,"" said Sotha Sil, continuing on to Iachesis' palace to meet with the Master of the Psijic Order, ""should not be discussed with the innocent."""

msgid "2920: The Last Year of the First Era\n\nBy Carlovac Townway\n\n3 Sun's Dawn\nThe Isle of Artaeum, Summerset\n\nSotha Sil watched the initiates float one by one up to the oassom tree, taking a fruit or a flower from its high branches before dropping back to the ground with varying degrees of grace. He took a moment to admire the day. The whitewashed statue of Syrabane, which the great mage was said to have posed for in ancient days, stood at the precipice of the cliff overlooking the bay. Beyond, ocean, and the misty border between Artaeum and the main island of Summerset.\n\n""By and large, acceptable,"" he proclaimed as the last student dropped her fruit in his hand. With a wave of his hand, the fruit and flowers were back in the tree. With another wave, the students had formed into position in a semicircle around the sorcerer. He pulled a small fibrous ball, about a foot in diameter from his white robes.\n\n""What is this?""\n\nThe students understood this test. It asked them to cast a spell of identification on the mysterious object. Each initiate closed his or her eyes and imagined the ball in the realm of the universal Truth. Its energy had a unique resonance as all physical and spiritual matter does, a negative aspect, a duplicate version, relative paths, true meaning, a song in the cosmos, a texture in the fabric of space, a facet of being that has always existed and always will exist.\n\n""A ball,"" said a young Nord named Welleg, which brought giggles from some of the younger initiates, but a frown from most, including Sotha Sil.\n\n""If you must be stupid, at least be amusing,"" growled the sorcerer, and then looked at a young, dark-haired Altmer lass who looked confused. ""Lilatha, do you know?""\n\n""It's grom,"" said Lilatha, uncertainly. ""What the dreugh meff after they've k-k-kr-krevinasim.""\n\n""Karvinasim, but very good, nonetheless,"" said Sotha Sil. ""Now, tell me, what does that mean?""\n\n""I don't know,"" admitted Lilatha. The rest of the students also shook their heads.\n\n""There are layers to understanding all things,"" said Sotha Sil. ""The common man looks at an object and fits it into a place in his way of thinking. Those skilled in the Old Ways, in the way of the Psijic, in Mysticism, can see an object and identify it by its proper role. But one more layer is needed to be peeled back to achieve understanding. You must identify the object by its role and its truth and interpret that meaning. In this case, this ball is indeed grom, which is a substance created by the dreugh, an underwater race in the north and western parts of the continent. For one year of their life, they undergo karvinasim when they walk upon the land. Following that, they return to the water and meff, or devour the skin and organs they needed for land-dwelling. Then they vomit it up into little balls like this. Grom. Dreugh vomit.""\n\nThe students looked at the ball a little queasily. Sotha Sil always loved this lesson.\n\n4 Sun's Dawn, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\n\n""Spies,"" muttered the Emperor, sitting in his bath, staring at a lump on his foot. ""All around me, traitors and spies.""\n\nHis mistress Rijja washed his back, her legs wrapped around his waist. When he was in a mood like this, it was best to be calmly, soothingly, seductively sensual. And not to say a word unless he asked her a direct question.\n\nWhich he did: ""What do you think when a fellow steps on his Imperial Majesty's foot and says 'I'm sorry, Your Imperial Majesty'? Don't you think 'Pardon me, Your Imperial Majesty' is more appropriate? 'I'm sorry,' well, that almost sounds like the bastard Argonian was sorry I am his Imperial Majesty. That he hopes we lose the war with Morrowind, that's what it sounds like.""\n\n""What would make you feel better?"" asked Rijja. ""Would you like him flogged? He is only, as you say, the Battlechief of Soulrest. It would teach him to mind where he's stepping.""\n\n""My father would have flogged him. My grandfather would have had him killed,"" the Emperor grumbled. ""But I don't mind if they all step on my feet, provided they respect me. And don't plot against me.""\n\n""You must trust someone.""\n\n""Only you,"" smiled the Emperor, turning slightly to give Rijja a kiss. ""And my son Juilek, I suppose, though I wish he were a little more cautious.""\n\n""And your council, and the Potentate?"" asked Rijja.\n\n""A pack of spies and a snake,"" laughed the Emperor, kissing his mistress again. He whispered, ""As long as you're true, I can handle the world.""\n\n13 Sun's Dawn, 2920\nMournhold, Morrowind\n\nTurala stood at the black, bejeweled city gates. A wind howled around her, but she felt nothing.\n\nThe Duke had been furious upon hearing his favorite mistress was pregnant and cast her from his sight. She tried again and again to see him, but his guards turned her away. Finally, she returned to her family and told them the truth. If only she had lied and told them she did not know who the father was. A soldier, a wandering adventurer, anyone. But she told them that the father was the Duke, a member of the House Indoril. And they did what she knew they would have to do, as proud members of the House Redoran.\n\nUpon her hand was burned the sign of Expulsion her weeping father had branded on her. But the Duke's cruelty hurt her far more. She looked out the gate and into the wide winter plains. Twisted, sleeping trees and skies without birds. No one in Morrowind would take her in now. She must go far away. \n\nWith slow, sad steps, she began her journey."

Sometimes, she would take everything of value within; other times, it was enough to experience the pure pleasure of finding a way past the locks and traps. In either situation, she would leave a pair of dice in a prominent location as her calling card to let the owners know who had burgled them. The mysterious ghost became known to the locals as Chance.\n \nA typical conversation in Balmora at this time:\n\n""My dear, whatever happened to that marvelous necklace of yours?"" \n\n""My dear, it was taken by Chance.""\n\nThe only time when Chance disliked her hobby was when she miscalculated, and she came upon an owner or a guard. So far, she had never been caught, or even seen, but dozens of times she had uncomfortably close encounters. There came a day when she felt it was time to expand her reach. She considered going to Vivec or Gnisis, but one night at the Eight Plates, she heard a tale of the Heran Ancestral Tomb, an ancient tomb filled with traps and possessing hundreds of years of the Heran family treasures.\n \nThe idea of breaking the spell of the Heran Tomb and gaining the fortune within appealed to Chance, but facing the guardians was outside of her experience. While she was considering her options, she saw Ulstyr Moresby sitting at a table nearby, by himself as usual. He was huge brute of a Breton who had a reputation as a gentle eccentric, a great warrior who had gone mad and paid more attention to the voices in his head than to the world around him.\n \nIf she must have a partner in this enterprise, Chance decided, this man would be perfect. He would not demand or understand the concept of getting an equal share of the booty. If worse came to worse, he would not be missed if the inhabitants of the Heran Tomb were too much for him. Or if Chance found his company tiresome and elected to leave him behind.\n \n""Ulstyr, I don't think we've ever met, but my name is Minevah,"" she said, approaching the table. ""I'm fancying a trip to the Heran Ancestral Tomb. If you think you could handle the monsters, I could take care of unlocking doors and popping traps. What do you think?""\n \nThe Breton took a moment to reply, as if considering the counsel of the voices in his head. Finally he nodded his head in the affirmative, mumbling, ""Yes, yes, yes, prop a rock, hot steel. Chitin. Walls beyond doors. Fifty-three. Two months and back.""\n \n""Splendid,"" said Chance, not the least put off by his rambling. ""We'll leave early tomorrow."""

When she finished, the woman walked into the river.\n\nRajhin could not let her drown, so he ran across the river's surface and pulled the woman from her would-be grave.\n\n""Why did you save me, my lord?"" she asked. ""Does Rajhin, the Trickster God, not know my intent?""\n\n""I know the what, my lady, but not the why.""\n\nThe woman frowned and turned her back. ""You could not possibly understand my plight. Please, let me gather my stones and continue on my way.""\n\nBut Rajhin would not let her continue until she shared her story.\n\nThe woman, Munilli, had a fiancee named Mazaram, and the two were much beloved. But Munilli's step-father Azelit-ra, was a greedy man. Before he would give them permission to marry, he insisted on a bride-price beyond Mazaram's considerable means, and well beyond all reason.\n\nAzelit-ra was headman of the village in which they lived and none dared speak against him for his injustice. But Mazaram was not cowed by Azelit-ra, which made the step-father hate him all the more. Still, Mazaram would not dishonor Munilli by eloping. Rather than see her fiancee ruined by her step-father's demands, Munilli chose the river.\n\n""You say your step-father rules your village?""\n\n""With an iron paw, my lord,"" Munilli replied sadly. ""Those he does not bribe owe him money. Only a few, such as Mazaram, remain free of his grasp … and he does what he can to ruin them.""\n\n""Do you think your step-father is satisfied ruling a tiny village?"" Rajhin asked.\n\n""Satisfied?"" Munilli scoffed, wiping her tears away. ""He does not know the meaning of the word.""\n\n""Then perhaps I can help. Come, let us find Mazaram.""\n\nAs they went to the village, Rajhin explained his plan to the young woman.\n\nThat afternoon, Mazaram and Munilli approached Azelit-ra upon the porch of his great moon-sugar plantation house. Seeing the hand-in-hand angered Azelit-ra, even though they were properly affianced. ""So, my little pauper,"" the step-father greeted Mazaram, ""have you agreed to my bride-price, or shall we finally see the last of you?""\n\nMazaram refused to take offense and instead bowed briefly. ""While it is true I cannot meet your bride-price, my lord, I can offer you something better.""\n\nAzelit-ra's ears twitched, but he sneered with skepticism. ""Better? Better than the sum I demand for my only daughter? Fine, tell me of this offer. If it is generous, then so be it. But if not, I would see your tail as you leave forever!"""

""Why can't I play in the waterfall?"" she asked.\n\nKwama Warrior, serious as always, never looked at Scrib as he spoke. Instead, he constantly scanned the cave for any potential threats that needed to be fought. Warrior liked to fight, and he was always looking for a battle. ""The waterfall? You can't fight the waterfall, Little Scrib. Water is cold and fast and it makes you drown. You should go back to the egg chamber and play with the other scribs where the other warriors and I can watch over you.""\n\nBrave Little Scrib didn't like that answer, either.

Not until the sun burned through her window, infusing the light wood and flesh colors of her chamber in a milky glow did she open her eyes. It was quiet and serene, a stunning reverse of the flavor of her dreams, so full of blood and celebration. For a few moments, she simply stared at the ceiling, trying to sort through her visions.\n\nIn the courtyard of her palace was a boiling pool which steamed in the coolness of the winter morning. At the wave of her hand, it cleared and she saw the face and form of her lover Vivec in his study to the north. She did not want to speak right away: he looked so handsome in his dark red robes, writing his poetry as he did every morning.\n\n""Vivec,"" she said, and he raised his head in a smile, looking at her face across thousands of miles. ""I have seen a vision of the end of the war.""\n\n""After eighty years, I don't think anyone can imagine an end,"" said Vivec with a smile, but he grew serious, trusting Almalexia's prophecies. ""Who will win? Morrowind or the Cyrodilic Empire?""\n\n""Without Sotha Sil in Morrowind, we will lose,"" she replied.\n\n""My intelligence tells me the Empire will strike us to the north in early springtide, by First Seed at the latest. Could you go to Artaeum and convince him to return?""\n\n""I'll leave today,"" she said, simply.\n\n4 Morning Star, 2920\nGideon, Black Marsh\n\nThe Empress paced around her cell. Wintertide gave her wasteful energy, while in the summer she would merely sit by her window and be grateful for each breath of stale swamp wind that came to cool her. Across the room, her unfinished tapestry of a dance at the Imperial Court seemed to mock her. She ripped it from its frame, tearing the pieces apart as they drifted to the floor.\n\nThen she laughed at her own useless gesture of defiance. She would have plenty of time to repair it and craft a hundred more. The Emperor had locked her up in Castle Giovesse seven years ago, and would likely keep her here until he or she died.\n\nWith a sigh, she pulled the cord to call her knight, Zuuk. He appeared at the door within minutes, fully uniformed as befitted an Imperial Guard. Most of the native Kothringi tribesmen of Black Marsh preferred to go about naked, but Zuuk had taken a positive delight to fashion. His silver, reflective skin was scarcely visible, only on his face, neck, and hands.\n\n""Your Imperial Highness,"" he said with a bow.\n\n""Zuuk,"" said Empress Tavia. ""I'm bored. Lets discuss methods of assassinating my husband today."""

msgid "We look down upon the beggars of the Empire. These lost souls are the poor and wretched of the land. Every city has its beggars. Most are so poor they have only the clothes on their backs. They eat the scraps the rest of us throw out. We toss them a coin so that we don't have to think too long about their plight.\n \nImagine my surprise when I heard the tale of the Beggar Prince. I could not imagine what a Prince of Beggars would be. Here is the tale I heard. It takes place in the first age, when gods walked like men and Daedra stalked the wilderness with impunity. It is a time before they were all confined to Oblivion.\n \n* * * \n\nThere once was a man named Wheedle. Or maybe it was a woman. The story goes to great lengths to avoid declaring Wheedle's gender. Wheedle was the 13th child of a king in Valenwood. As such Wheedle was in no position to take the throne or even inherit much property or wealth.\n \nWheedle had left the palace to find independent fortune and glory. After many days of endless forest roads and tiny villages, Wheedle came upon three men surrounding a beggar. The beggar was swaddled in rags from head to toe. No portion of the vagabond's body was visible. The men were intent on slaying the beggar.\n \nWith a cry of rage and indignation, Wheedle charged the men with sword drawn. Being simple townsfolk, armed only with pitchforks and scythes, they immediately fled from the armored figure with the shining sword.\n \n""Many thanks for saving me,"" wheezed the beggar from beneath the heap of foul rags. Wheedle could barely stand the stench.\n \n""What is your name, wretch?"" Wheedle asked.\n \n""I am Namira.""\n \nUnlike the townsfolk, Wheedle was well learned. That name meant nothing to them, but to Wheedle it was an opportunity.\n \n""You are the Daedric lord!"" Wheedle exclaimed. ""Why did you allow those men to harass you? You could have slain them all with a whisper.""\n \n""I am pleased you recognized me,"" Namira rasped. ""I am frequently reviled by townsfolk. It pleases me to be recognized for my name, if not for my attribute.""\n \nWheedle knew that Namira was the Daedric lord of all thing gross and repulsive. Diseases such as leprosy and gangrene were her domain. Where others might have seen danger, Wheedle saw opportunity.\n \n""Oh, great Namira, let me apprentice myself to you. I ask only that you grant me powers to make my fortune and forge a name for myself that will live through the ages.""\n \n""Nay. I make my way alone in the world. I have no need for an apprentice.""\n \nNamira shambled off down the road. Wheedle would not be put off. With a bound, Wheedle was at Namira's heel, pressing the case for an apprenticeship. For 33 days and nights, Wheedle kept up the debate. Namira said nothing, but Wheedle's voice was ceaseless. Finally, on the 33rd day, Wheedle was too hoarse to talk.\n \nNamira looked back on the suddenly silent figure. Wheedle knelt in the mud at her feet, open hands raised in supplication.\n \n""It would seem you have completed your apprenticeship to me after all,"" Namira declared. ""I shall grant your request.""\n \nWheedle was overjoyed.\n \n""I grant you the power of disease. You may be afflicted with any disease you choose, changing them at will, so long as it has visible symptoms. However, you must always bear at least one.\n \n""I grant you the power of pity. You may evoke pity in anyone that sees you.\n \n""Finally, I grant you the power of disregard. You may cause others to disregard your presence.""\n \nWheedle was aghast. These were not boons from which a fortune could be made. They were curses, each awful in its own right, but together they were unthinkable.\n \n""How am I to make my fortune and forge a name for myself with these terrible gifts?""\n \n""As you begged at my feet for 33 days and 33 nights, so shall you now beg for your fortune in the cities of men. Your name will become legendary among the beggars of Tamriel. The story of Wheedle, the Prince of Beggars, shall be handed down throughout the generations.""\n \nIt was as Namira predicted. Wheedle was an irresistible beggar. None could see the wretch without desperately wanting to toss a coin at the huddled form. However, Wheedle also discovered that the power of disregard gave great access to the secrets of the realms. People unknowingly said important things where Wheedle could hear them. Wheedle grew to know the comings and goings of every citizen in the city.\n \nTo this day, it is said that if you really want to know something, go ask the beggars. They have eyes and ears throughout the cities. They know all the little secrets of the daily lives of its citizens."

msgid "By Anonymous\n\nGalsiah brought out the map of the guildhouse, freshly stolen, and they began to detail out the strategy.\n \nThe last several hours had been a whirlwind to all. In less than a day, the three had met, formulated a plan, bought or stolen the necessary ingredients, and were about to execute it. Not one of the three were sure whether confidence or stupidity were driving the other two, but the fates were aligned. The guildhouse was going to be robbed.\n \nWhen the sun set, Lledos, Galsiah, and Imalyn approached the Cobblers Guildhouse on the east end of town. Galsiah used her cachous of stoneflower to mask their scent from the guard wolves as the three passed over the parapets. She also acted as lead scout, and Lledos was impressed. For someone of relative inexperience, she knew her way through shadows.\n \nLledos's expertise was demonstrated a dozen times, and the guards were of such a diverse variety, he was able to demonstrate all the means of silent assassination he had developed over the years.\n \nImalyn opened the vault in his unique and systematic method. As the tumblers fell beneath his fingers, he softly sang an old dirty tavern song about the Ninety-Nine Loves of Boethiah. He said it helped him focus and organize difficult combinations. Within seconds, the vault was open and the gold was in hand.\n \nThey left the guildhouse an hour after they entered. No alarm had been raised, the gold was gone, and corpses lay pooling blood on the stone floors within.\n \n""Well done, my friends, well done. You learned well."" Lledos said as he poured the gold pieces into the specially designed compartments in his tunic's sleeves, where they held fast with no jingling or unusual bulges. ""We'll meet back at the Plot and Plaster tomorrow morning and split up the bounty.""\n \nThe group parted ways. The only person who knew the most covert route through the city's sewer system, Lledos, slipped in through a duct and vanished below. Galsiah threw on her shawl, muddied her face to resemble an old f'lah fortune-teller, and headed north. Imalyn headed east into the park, trusting his unnatural senses to keep him away from the city watch.\n \nNow I teach them the greatest lesson of all, thought Lledos as he sloshed through the labyrinthine tunnels of sludge. His guar was waiting where he left it at the city gates, making a laconic lunch of the chokeweed shrub to which it had been leashed.\n \nOn the road to Vivec, he thought of Galsiah and Imalyn. Perhaps they had been caught and brought in for questioning already. It was a pity he couldn't see them undergoing interrogation. Who would break under pressure first? Imalyn was certainly the tougher of the two, but Galsiah doubtless had hidden reserves. It was merely intellectual curiosity: they thought his name was Lledos and he was meeting them at the Plot and Plaster. The authorities wouldn't therefore be looking for a Dunmer named Sathis celebrating his wealth miles and miles away in Vivec.\n \nAs he prodded his mount forward and the sun began rising, Sathis pictured Galsiah and Imalyn not undergoing interrogation, but sleeping the good deep sleep of the wicked, dreaming of how they would spend their share of the gold. Both would wake up early and rush to the Plot and Plaster. He could see them now, Imalyn laughing and carrying on, Galsiah hushing him to avoid bringing undue attention. They would take a couple flagons of greef, perhaps order a meal—a big one—and wait. Hours would pass, and so would their moods. The chain of reactions that every betrayed person exhibits: nervousness, doubt, bewilderment, anger.\n \nThe sun was fully risen when Sathis reached the stables of his house on the outskirts of Vivec. He reigned in his guar and filled its feed. The rest of the stalls were empty. It wouldn't be until that afternoon when his servants returned from the feast of St. Rilms in Gnisis. They were good people, and he treated them well, but from past experience he knew that servants talked. If they began to connect his absences with thefts in other towns, it was only a matter of time before they would go to the authorities or blackmail him. After all, they were human. It was best in the long run to give them a week off with pay whenever he was out of town on business.\n \nHe slipped the gold into the vault in his study, and went upstairs. The schedule had been tight, but Sathis had given himself a few hours to rest before his household returned. His own bed was wonderfully soft and warm compared to the dreadful mattress he had to use at the canton in Tel Aruhn.\n \nSathis woke up some time later from a nightmare. For a second after he opened his eyes, he thought he could still hear Imalyn's voice nearby, singing ""The Ninety-Nine Loves of Boethiah."" He lay still in his bed, waiting, but there was no sound except the usual creaks and groans of his old house. Afternoon sunlight came through his bedroom window in ribbons, catching dust. He closed his eyes.\n \nThe song returned, and Sathis heard the vault door in his study swing open. The smell of stoneflower filled his nose and he opened his eyes. Only a little of the afternoon sunlight could pierce the inside of the burlap sack.\n \nA strong, feminine hand clamped over the mouth and a thumb jabbed under his chin. Just as his throat opened and his head was shoved to the side, he heard Galsiah say in her typical calm voice, ""Thank you for the lesson, Sathis."""

msgid "By Anonymous\n\n""The problem with thieves today,"" said Lledos, ""is the lack of technique. I know there's no honor among thieves, and there never was, but there used to be some pride, some skill, some basic creativity. It really makes those of us with a sense of history despair.""\n \nImalyn sneered, slamming down his flagon of greef violently on the rough-hewn table. ""B'vek, what do you want us to say? You asks us 'What do you do when you see a guard?' and I says, 'Stab the fetcher in the back.' What d'you prefer? We challenge 'em to a game of chits?""\n \n""So much ambition, so little education,"" said Lledos with a sigh. ""My dear friends, we aren't mugging some Nord tourist fresh off the ferry. The Cobblers Guildhall may not sound intimidating but tonight, when the dues collection is housed there before being sent to the bank, the security's going to be tighter than a kwama's ass. You can't just stab at every back you encounter and expect to make it into the vaults.""\n \n""Why don't you explain specifically what you'd like us to do?"" asked Galsiah calmly, trying to keep the tone of the group down. Most locals at the Plot and Plaster cornerclub in Tel Aruhn knew enough not to listen in, but she knew better than to take any chances.\n \n""The common thief,"" said Lledos, pouring himself more greef, and warming to his subject. ""sticks his dagger in his opponent's back. This may slay the target, but more often gives him time to scream and drenches the attacker with blood. Not good. Now a good throat-slashing, properly executed, can both slay and silence a guard and leave the thief relatively bloodfree. And after all, after the robbery, we don't want people seeing a bunch of blood-soaked butchers running through the streets. Even in Tel Aruhn, that's likely to warrant suspicion.\n \n""If you can catch your victim lying down asleep or resting, you are in an excellent position. You place one hand over the mouth with your thumb under the chin, then you use your other hand to slit the throat, and quickly turn the head to one side so the body bleeds out away from you. There is a risk here of becoming blood-stained if you don't move the head quickly enough. If you're unsure, strangle the victim first to avoid the blood that tends to spurt out in three foot jets when someone is stabbed while alive.\n \n""A very good friend of mine, a thief in Gnisis whose name I won't mention, swears by the strangle-and-slash technique. Simply put, you grab your victim's throat from behind and while throttling him, you batter his face against the opposite wall. When the victim is thus rendered unconscious, you slash his throat while still holding him from behind, and the risk of staining one's clothes with blood is practically nonexistent.\n \n""The classic technique, which requires less grappling than my friend's variation, is to place one hand over the victim's mouth, and then saw through the throat in three or four strokes rather like playing a violin. It requires little effort, and while there's quite a bit of blood, it all jets forward away from you.\n \nThere's no reason when one knows one is going to be slitting some throats not to take some precautions and bring some extra equipment. The best neck-hackers I know generally carry a bit of wadded cloth on the aft-side of their knives to keep blood from getting on their cuffs. It's impractical for this sort of assignment, but when you're only anticipating one or two victims, nothing beats throwing a sack over the target's head, drawing the string tight, and then supplying the killing blow or blows.""\n \nImalyn laughed loudly, ""Can I see a demonstration sometime?""\n \n""Very soon,"" said Lledos. ""If Galsiah has done her job.""\n \nGalsiah brought out the map of the guildhouse, freshly stolen, and they began to detail out the strategy.\n \nThe last several hours had been a whirlwind to all. In less than a day, the three had met, formulated a plan, bought or stolen the necessary ingredients, and were about to execute it. Not one of the three were sure whether confidence or stupidity were driving the other two, but the fates were aligned. The guildhouse was going to be robbed."

It was a pity, he thought, that he was prone to seasickness. There was nothing for him now in Tamriel to the east or to the west. Vivec's tale of his poor spycraft had spread to taverns everywhere. The Baron of Dwynnen had released him from his contract. No doubt they were laughing about him in Daggerfall, too, and Dawnstar, Lilmoth, Rimmen, Greenheart, probably in Akavir and Yokuda for that matter. Perhaps it would be best to drop into the waves and sink. The thought, however, did not stay long in his mind: it was not despair that haunted him, but rage. Impotent fury that he could not assuage.\n\n""Excuse me, sir,"" said a voice behind him, making him jump. ""I'm sorry to disturb you, but I was wondering whether you could recommend an inexpensive tavern for me to spend the night.""\n\nIt was a young man, a Nord, with a sack over his shoulder. Obviously, he had just disembarked from one of the boats. For the first time in weeks, someone was looking at Cassyr as something other than a colossal, famous idiot. He could not help, black as his mood was, but be friendly.\n\n""You've just arrived from Skyrim?"" asked Cassyr.\n\n""No, sir, that's where I'm going,"" said the fellow. ""I'm working my way home. I've come up from Sentinel, and before that Stros M'kai, and before that Woodhearth in Valenwood, and before that Artaeum in Summerset. Welleg's my name.""\n\nCassyr introduced himself and shook Welleg's hand. ""Did you say you came from Artaeum? Are you a Psijic?""\n\n""No, sir, not anymore,"" the fellow shrugged. ""I was expelled.""\n\n""Do you know anything about summoning Daedra? You see, I want to cast a curse against a particularly powerful person, one might say a living god, and I haven't had any luck. The Baron won't allow me in his sight, but the Baroness has sympathy for me and allowed me the use of their Summoning Chambers."" Cassyr spat. ""I did all the rituals, made sacrifices, but nothing came of it.""\n\n""That'd be because of Sotha Sil, my old master,"" replied Welleg with some bitterness. ""The Daedra princes have agreed not to be summoned by any amateurs at least until the war ends. Only the Psijics may counsel with the Daedra, and a few nomadic sorcerers and witches.""\n\n""Witches, did you say?"""

A roaring fire in the pit in the center of the room cast an almost sinister glow on all the regulars, and made the abundance of bodies look like a punishment tapestry inspired by the Arcturian Heresies. Cassyr took his usual place with his cousin and ordered a flagon of ale.\n\n""Have you been to see the Baron?"" asked Palyth.\n\n""Yes, he may have work for me in the palace of Urvaius,"" said Cassyr proudly. ""But more than that I can't say. You understand, secrets of state and all that. Why are there so many damned people here tonight?""\n\n""A shipload of Dark Elves just came in to harbor. They've come from the war. I was just waiting until you got here to introduce you as another veteran.""\n\nCassyr blushed, but regained his composure enough to ask: ""What are they doing here? Has there been a truce?""\n\n""I don't know the full story,"" said Palyth. ""But apparently, the Emperor and Vivec are in negotiations again. These fellas here have investments they were keen to check on, and they figured things on the Bay were quiet enough. But the only way we can get the full story is to talk to the chaps.""\n\nWith that, Palyth gripped his cousin's arm and pulled him to the other side of the bar so suddenly, Cassyr would have had to struggle violently to resist. The Dunmeri travelers were spread out across four of the tables, laughing with the locals. They were largely amiable young men, well-dressed, befitting merchants, animated in gesture made more extravagant by liquor.\n\n""Excuse me,"" said Palyth, intruding on the conversation. ""My shy cousin Cassyr was in the war as well, fighting for the living god, Vivec.""\n\n""The only Cassyr I ever heard of,"" said one of the Dunmer drunkenly with a wide, friendly smile, shaking Cassyr's free hand. ""Was a Cassyr Whitley, who Vivec said was the worst spy in history. We lost Ald Marak due to his bungling intelligence work. For your sake, friend, I hope the two of you were never confused.""\n\nCassyr smiled and listened as the lout told the story of his failure with bountiful exaggerations which caused the table to roar with laughter. Several eyes looked his way, but none of the locals sought to explain that the fool of the tale was standing at attention. The eyes that stung the most were his cousin's, the young man who had believed that he had returned to Dwynnen a great hero. At some point, certainly, the Baron would hear about it, his idiocy increasing manifold with each retelling.\n\nWith every fiber in his soul, Cassyr cursed the living god Vivec.\n\n21 Frostfall, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\n\nCorda, in a robe of blinding whiteness, a uniform of the priestesses of the Hegathe Morwha conservatorium, arrived in the City just as the first winter storm was passing. The clouds broke with sunlight, and the beauteous teenaged Redguard girl appeared in the wide avenue with escort, riding toward the Palace. While her sister was tall, thin, angular, and haughty, Corda was a small, round-faced lass with wide brown eyes. The locals were quick to draw comparisons.\n\n""Not a month after Lady Rijja's execution,"" muttered a housemaid, peering out the window, and winking to her neighbor.\n\n""And not a month out of the nunnery neither,"" the other woman agreed, reveling in the scandal. ""This one's in for a ride. Her sister weren't no innocent, and look where she ended up."""

A thin glob of saliva burbled down between its fangs, and hung suspended. Turala had never seen anything of its kind before, reptilian and massive, perched on its hind legs like a man. Mynistera applauded enthusiastically.\n\n""My child,"" she crowed. ""You have come so far in so short a time. What were you thinking when you summoned this daedroth?""\n\nIt took Turala a moment to recall whether she was thinking anything at all. She was merely overwhelmed that she had reached out across the fabric of reality into the realm of Oblivion, and plucked forth this loathsome creature, conjuring it into the world by the power of her mind.\n\n""I was thinking of the color red,"" Turala said, concentrating. ""The simplicity and clarity of it. And then—I desired, and spoke the charm. And this is what I conjured up.""\n\n""Desire is a powerful force for a young witch,"" said Mynistera. ""And it is well matched in this instance. For this daedroth is nothing if not a simple force of the spirits. Can you release your desire as easily?""\n\nTurala closed her eyes and spoke the dismissal invocation. The monster faded away like a painting in sunlight, still blinking confusedly. Mynistera embraced her Dark Elf pupil, laughing with delight.\n\n""I never would have believed it, a month and a day you've been with the coven, and you're already far more advanced than most of the women here. There is powerful blood in you, Turala, you touch spirits like you were touching a lover. You'll be leading this coven one day—I have seen it!""\n\nTurala smiled. It was good to be complimented. The Duke of Mournhold had praised her pretty face; and her family, before she had dishonored them, praised her manners. Cassyr had been nothing more than a companion: his compliments meant nothing. But with Mynistera, she felt she was home.\n\n""You'll be leading the coven for many years yet, great sister,"" said Turala.\n\n""I certainly intend to. But the spirits, while marvelous companions and faultless tellers of truth, are often hazy about the when and hows. You can't blame them really. When and how mean so little to them."" Mynistera opened the door to the shed, allowing the brisk autumn breeze in to dispel the bitter and fetid smells of the daedroth. ""Now, I need you to run an errand to Wayrest. It's only a week's ride there, and a week's ride back. Bring Doryatha and Celephyna with you. As much as we try to be self-sufficient, there are herbs we can't grow here, and we seem to run through an enormous quantity of gems in no time at all. It's important that the people of the city learn to recognize you as one of the wise women of Skeffington coven. You'll find the benefits of being notorious far outweigh the inconveniences.""\n\nTurala did as she was bade. As she and her sisters climbed aboard their horses, Mynistera brought her child, little five-month-old Bosriel to kiss her mother goodbye. The witches were in love with the little Dunmeri infant, fathered by a wicked duke, birthed by wild Ayleid Elves in the forest heart of the Empire. Turala knew her nursemaids would protect her child with their lives. After many kisses and a farewell wave, the three young witches rode off into the bright woods, under a covering of red, yellow, and orange."

They say the great craftsman made a deal with the Divines, or some long forgotten god, to bind the winds and see the ship safely to those foreign shores.\n\nAnd lastly, we tell of how our three heroes reached that hostile shore and found the people there were warlike and feasted on the flesh of their enemies. How their crew clamored to fight the savages and drive them away, a conquered people, but the Heroes of the Sanctuary did not listen to the council of rash and foolish Elves. \n\nInstead they met with the leaders of the Wood Elves, and studied their customs. They learned of the Green Pact, which forbids damage to the forest, and of the Meat Mandate, which commands these Elves to eat those they defeat in battle, and most importantly of all, they learned of the Rite of Theft.\n\nIt was customary that the Wood Elves would steal from each other, and on return of the stolen item, demand a boon commensurate to the item's worth. \n\nIt happened that the Heroes of the Sanctuary had brought a staff of great value with them. So they made a deal with the Wood Elves. If the Wood Elves could steal the staff from them, they would leave and never return. However, if they could steal an item from each of the Wood Elf treethanes, then they would be allowed to found a settlement on the shores of Valenwood.\n\nThe deal was struck, and the Heroes swiftly and cleverly set about stealing from the treethanes. From one they stole a prized bow. Another they tricked into handing over a valued necklace in exchange for ""all of the most valuable thing in the world that they could hold in their hands."" The most valuable thing in the world, as any one knows, is air—for without it we could not live.\n\nAt the end of the appointed time, all of the treethanes' items had been stolen, but the Wood Elves had not managed to steal the staff. And that is how Seaside Sanctuary came to be, thanks to the bravery, cleverness, and vision of Eldamar, Hirume, and Meluuran."

msgid "Everywhere Erric looked, he saw white armor and Alessian banners. It wasn't a scouting party that the mercenaries attacked—it was an entire cohort of Alessian soldiers.\n\nThe mercenaries fought hard, but they were undisciplined. They lunged at the wall of armored soldiers like drunks in a tavern brawl. They were cut down, one after another, with relative ease. The Alessians simply blocked and parried each attack, taunting their foolish foes before cutting them down.\n\nThe only members of the mercenary band that appeared to be having anything close to success were Calinden and Kish'na. The Ayleid knight Calinden's massive two-handed sword sliced through armor, flesh, and bone with equal ease, while the Khajiit Kish'na's twin blades twirled around her in an exotic dance of death.\n\nErric watched in awe as the battle played out in front of him. He knew that if he charged in to help the mercenaries, he would be cut down before he could so much as scratch an Alessian shield with his rusted sword. But if he turned and ran, and if any of the mercenaries survived, he would be remembered as a coward and a fake. They might even come after him, looking for revenge. All these thoughts and more bounced around and collided inside his head, leaving him frozen with indecision and fear.\n\nBut nothing brings clarity of mind like a sharp blade cutting through the air in front of you and rushing toward your face. Erric barely dodged out of the way, just as an Alessian soldier backed into him and knocked him to the ground. The rusty blade that Erric had been holding so tightly flew from his hand as he landed on his back. His helmet slammed into the wall he had been standing next to, and for a moment everything went black.\n\nThe next thing Erric knew, Calinden was standing beside him and lifting him to his feet. The street around him was littered with Alessian corpses. The Ayleid knight said nothing. He simply turned and walked back into battle. \n\nErric had seen enough. He couldn't take it anymore. With growing frenzy, he looked for a path of escape. He could count the number of remaining mercenaries on one hand, but the sea of Alessians seemed as wide and deep as the waves that crashed along the Daggerfall coast. At that moment, Erric knew that he didn't want to die. He picked a direction and started to run—right past the most frantic and bloody fighting.\n\nAs Erric's legs carried him past the combatants, he reached down and grabbed a sword lying near one of the many corpses. Drawing on reserves he didn't know he had, he increased his speed. He focused on reaching the nearest open doorway or getting around the next corner. He knew that he could lose himself in the back streets if he could just get away from the fighting. He was close. He was going to make it.\n\nAs Erric turned the corner to make his escape, the sword he carried before him slid into something soft and wet. He was staring into the face of an Alessian officer who looked as surprised as he was. The officer wore multiple badges of honor, but not one of them had been enough to save him. Erric's blade had slid into the space between where the officer's armor connected front to back, slicing between ribs and puncturing a lung. The officer gasped as his eyes rolled back and his knees buckled.\n\nAs the officer dropped to the ground, he let go of the ivory horn he had been holding. It rolled to a stop next to Erric's right foot. Erric stared at the horn for a moment, then he picked it up and stowed it in his belt. He had no idea what he was going to do with it, but it seemed like a good idea at the time.\n\nThat's when the arrow buried itself in Erric's back. He stumbled forward as pain radiated from the point of impact. Already, his vision was starting to blur. He saw the Khajiit and the Elf run toward him. He saw an army of Alessians chasing after them. He tried to breathe but that made everything hurt even more.\n\nAnd then everything faded and Erric saw nothing at all."

msgid "By Halund Greycloak\n\nIn the days beyond memory, when men first walked the lands of Skyrim, there arose in the city of Saarthal a great enchanter. As a boy, his gift for magic and artifice had been evident to his tutors. As a man, his skill surpassed them all. And finding nothing more to learn among his kin, he left wife and child, and set out to train under the Elven masters.\n \nA year became two, then three. And when finally his path led him back to Saarthal, he found only ruins: for the Elves had sacked the city, and all that lived there were dead or gone. Amid the ashes, in the smoldering ruins of his home, he swore a terrible oath of vengeance. And from that comes the name the legends give him: Ahzidal, the embittered destroyer.\n \nAlone, he could do nothing. And so, he bided his time, delving deeper into his art than any before him. From the Dwemer, he learned the seven natures of metal and how to harmonize them. From the Ayleids, the ancient runes and dawn-magic even the Elves had begun to forget. Among Falmer and Chimer and Altmer he traveled, taking what he could from each, and all the while plotting how he might turn that knowledge against them.\n \nFinally, word reached him of Ysgramor and his Companions, newly-arrived from Atmora. For three days and nights, he rode north, and met them as they made landfall on the icy coast near the ruins of Saarthal, which the Elves had fortified against them. He offered the Companions his service, and all he had produced in his years of labor. And with Atmoran steel imbued with his enchantments, the Elves fell before them, and at last he had his revenge.\n\nBut he was not content. His craft had become his life, and his hunger for knowledge still gnawed at him, driving him to delve ever deeper. At long last, he exhausted the lore of the Elves, but it was not enough. He sought the secrets of Dragon-runes, and won for himself a seat among their high priests, but it was not enough. And at length, he turned his gaze to the planes of Oblivion, and found there both power and madness.\n \nSome say he ventured there, never to return. Others, that he was betrayed by his fellow Dragon Priests, and killed, or driven into hiding in the ruins beneath his beloved Saarthal. Among the Skaal of Solstheim, it is said he fled to their island, and was sealed in the depths of Kolbjorn Barrow, together with the last of his relics.\n\nBut that is the tale, as it was told among the bards of Winterhold. Whatever the truth, the legend of Ahzidal was intended as a warning: in pursuit of perfection, one must take care that the pursuit itself does not become all-consuming."

msgid "The sound of clanking armor and approaching footsteps echoed through the dark streets. It was obvious that the marchers didn't care if they were heard. In fact, it sounded like they were trying to make more noise than was necessary.\n\nErric Deleyn closed his eyes and listened. He tried to count how many armor-clad boots were pounding toward them. Not that the numbers mattered. If there were two Alessians or ten, Erric knew how it would end. ""Someone's going to stick a blade right through my head,"" he thought.\n\nErric felt a hand touch his shoulder and he opened his eyes. Calinden, the mercenary Ayleid knight with the long-flowing golden hair squeezed his shoulder reassuringly. ""Stick close to me,"" Calinden said.\n\nA sense of calm came over Erric as he nodded in response. It was as if the Ayleid knight knew exactly what Erric was thinking. Erric would have taken more comfort in that thought if the sounds of the footsteps weren't getting closer and louder.\n\nKish'na, a Khajiiti warrior on Erric's other side, pulled two blades from their sheaths and held one up. She wanted them to hold for her signal. The other mercenaries in the alley shifted back and forth, excitement and fear shining in their eyes as they waited for the order to attack.\n\nMore steps. Louder. Louder. And then silence.\n\nErric looked around in surprise. Why had the unseen marchers stopped? The rest of the mercenary band seemed as confused as he was. Except for Kish'na and Calinden. Kish'na's raised blade did not move.\n\nErric would later learn that what happened next is what usually happens when you hire people willing to stab other people with swords and daggers. The mercenaries grow impatient and become eager to spill blood so they can collect their gold. Usually, this break in discipline brings such hired soldiers to their end that much quicker. And, unfortunately, it was Erric's group that broke first.\n\n""Kill those bastards!""\n\nThe yell rang out from someone behind and to the left of where Erric was standing. Suddenly they were rushing forward, more a tangled mass than a fighting formation. Erric was pushed to the side as weapon waving mercenaries shoved past him.\n\n""What are those idiots doing?"" Kish'na demanded as the mercenaries left the cover of the alley. She shook her head in frustration but ran out after them, her twin blades drawn and ready.\n\nCalinden turned to Erric. ""Remember what I said."" And with that, the Elf pulled the large blade from the sheath on his back and ran to join the fray.\n\nErric felt panic overwhelm him and he stood frozen in place. The clang of weapons and shield. The roars of battle. The screams of pain. Everything sounded muffled to Erric's ears. His feet felt stuck to the cobbled street. The war had arrived, and Erric could only watch it unfold before him.\n\nAfter an eternity that really only lasted a few seconds, Erric was finally able to move. He lifted one foot and placed in front of the other. Slowly, deliberately, he repeated this action until he reached the edge of the alley wall. Erric took a steadying breath. Then he peered around the wall."

In red ink on the margins, ""Yes, I see. Was the acid spell cast uniformly over the entire body of the subject?""

It's addressed to Sedura Iachilla Xyr. His wife, do you think?\n \nCLAVIDES: Iachilla. That was the Telvanni of the Xyr family who I heard about in connection with the giant-slaying.

I find fire to be too unpredictable.\n\nAs she speaks, the flames in the torchs extinguish. The stage is utterly dark. There is the sound of a struggle, swords clanging. Suddenly a bolt of lightning flashes out, and there is silence. From the darkness, Anana/Iachilla speaks. \n\nANARA / IACHILLA: Fascinating.\n\nThere are several more flashes of lightning as the curtain closes. \n\nTHE END"

It was as if she was willing herself to be unconscious before the axe stroke. Her eyes were bound so she could not see her former lover, the Emperor, seated before her, glaring with his one good eye. She could not see the Potentate Versidue-Shaie, his coil neatly wrapped beneath him, a look of triumph in his golden face. She could feel, numbly, the executioner's hand touch her back to steady her. She flinched like a dreamer trying to awake.\n\nThe first blow caught the back of her head and she screamed. The next hacked through her neck, and she was dead.\n\nThe Emperor turned to the Potentate wearily, ""Now that's done. You said she had a pretty sister in Hammerfell named Corda?""\n\n18 Hearth Fire, 2920\nDwynnen, High Rock\n\nThe horse the witches had sold him was not as good as his old one, Cassyr considered. Spirit worship and sacrifice and sisterhood might be all well and good for conjuring spirits, but it tends to spoil beasts of burden. Still, there was little to complain about. With the Dunmeri woman and her child gone, he had made excellent time. Ahead were the walls surrounding the city of his homeland. Almost at once, he was set upon by his old friends and family.\n\n""How went the war?"" cried his cousin, running to the road. ""Is it true that Vivec signed a peace with the Prince, but the Emperor refuses to honor it?""\n\n""That's not how it was, was it?"" asked a friend, joining them. ""I heard that the Dunmer had the Prince murdered and then made up a story about a treaty, but there's no evidence for it.""\n\n""Isn't there anything interesting happening here?"" Cassyr laughed. ""I really don't have the least interest in discussing the war or Vivec.""\n\n""You missed the procession of the Lady Corda,"" said his friend. ""She came across the bay with full entourage and then east to the Imperial City.""\n\n""But that's nothing. What was Vivec like?"" asked his cousin eagerly. ""He supposed to be a living god.""\n\n""If Sheogorath steps down and they need another God of Madness, he'll do,"" said Cassyr haughtily.\n\n""And the women?"" asked the lad, who had only seen Dunmeri ladies on very rare occasions.\n\nCassyr merely smiled. Turala Skeffington flashed into his mind for an instant before fading away. She would be happy with the coven, and her child would be well cared for. But they were part of the past now, a place and a war he wanted to forget forever. Dismounting his horse, he walked it into the city, chatting of trivial gossip of life on the Iliac Bay."

Now it seemed strangely comforting. Beyond the bog lay the city of Gideon. It was funny, she thought, that she had never stepped foot in its streets, though she had watched it every day for seventeen years.\n\n""Can you think of anything I've forgotten?"" she asked, turning to look back on the loyal Kothringi Zuuk.\n\n""I know exactly what to do,"" he said simply. He seemed to smile, but the Empress realized that it was only her own face reflected in his silvery skin. She was smiling, and she didn't even realize it.\n\n""Make certain you aren't followed,"" she warned. ""I don't want my husband to know where my gold's been hiding all these years. And do take your share of it. You've been a good friend.""\n\nThe Empress Tavia stepped forward and dropped from sight into the mists. Zuuk replaced the bars on the tower window, and threw a blanket over some pillows on her bed. With any luck, they would not discover her body on the lawn until morning, at which time he hoped to be halfway to Morrowind."

msgid "2920: The Last Year of the First Era\n\nBy Carlovac Townway\n\n31 Last Seed, 2920\nDorsza Pass, Black Marsh\n\nThe moon was rising over the desolate quarry, steaming with swamp gas from a particularly hot summer as the Prince and his two guard escort rode out of the forest. The massive piles of earth and dung had been piled high in antiquity by some primitive, long-dead tribe of Black Marsh, hoping to keep out some evil from the north. Evidently, the evil had broken through at Dorsza Pass, the large crack in the sad, lonely rampart that stretched for miles.\n\nThe black twisted trees that grew on the barrier cast strange shadows down, like a net tangling. The Prince's mind was on his mother's cryptic letter, hinting at the threat of an invasion. He could not, of course, tell the Dunmer about it, at the very least until he knew more and had notified his father. After all, the letter was meant for him. It was its urgent tone that made him decide to go directly to Gideon.\n\nThe Empress had also warned him about a band of former slaves who attacked caravans going into Dorsza Pass. She advised him to be certain to make his Imperial shield visible, so they would know he was not one of the hated Dunmeri slavers. Upon riding into the tall weeds that flooded through the pass like a noxious river, the Prince ordered that his shield be displayed.\n\n""I can see why the slaves use this,"" said the Prince's captain. ""It's an excellent location for an ambush.""\n\nJuilek nodded his head, but his thoughts were elsewhere. What threat of invasion could the Empress have discovered? Were the Akaviri on the seas again? If so, how could his mother from her cell in Castle Giovesse know of it? A rustle in the weeds and a single sharp human cry behind him interrupted his ponderings.\n\nTurning around, the Prince discovered that he was alone. His escort had vanished.\n\nThe Prince peered over the stretch of the moonlit sea of grass which waved in almost hypnotic patterns to the ebb and flow of the night wind billowing through the pass. It was impossible to tell if a struggling soldier was beneath this system of vibrations, a dying horse behind another. A high, whistling wind drowned out any sound the victims of the ambush might be making.\n\nJuilek drew his sword, and thought about what to do, his mind willing his heart not to panic. He was closer to the exit of the pass than the entrance. Whatever had slain his escort must have been behind him. If he rode fast enough, perhaps he could outrun it. Spurring his horse to gallop, he charged for the hills ahead, framed by the mighty black piles of dirt.\n\nWhen he was thrown, it happened so suddenly, he was hurtling forward before he was truly conscious of the fact. He landed several yards beyond where his horse had fallen, breaking his shoulder and his back on impact. A numbness washed over him as he stared at his poor, dying steed, its belly sliced open by one of several spears jutting up just below the surface of the grass.\n\nPrince Juilek was not able to turn and face the figure that emerged from the grass, nor able to move to defend himself. His throat was cut without ceremony.\n\nMiramor cursed when he saw the face of his victim more clearly in the moonlight. He had seen the Emperor at the Battle of Bodrum when he had fought in His Imperial Majesty's command, and this was clearly not the Emperor. Searching the body, he found the letter and a treaty signed by Vivec, Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and the Duke of Mournhold representing Morrowind and the Prince Juilek Cyrodiil, representing the Cyrodilic Empire.\n\n""Curse my luck,"" muttered Miramor to himself and the whispering grass. ""I've only killed a Prince. Where's the reward in that?""\n\nMiramor destroyed the letter, as Zuuk had instructed him to do, and pocketed the treaty. At the very least, such a curiosity would have some market value. He disassembled the traps as he pondered his next step. Return to Gideon and ask his employer for a lesser reward for killing the heir? Move on to other lands? At the very least, he considered, he had picked up two useful skills from the Battle of Bodrum. From the Dunmer, he had learned the excellent spear trap. And abandoning the Imperial Army, he had learned how to skulk in the grass.\n\n2 Hearth Fire, 2920\nGideon, Black Marsh\n\nThe Empress Tavia lay across her bed, a hot late summer wind she could not feel banging the shutters of her cell to and fro against the iron bars. Her throat felt like it was on fire but still she sobbed, uncontrollably, wringing her last tapestry in her hands. Her wailing echoed throughout the hollow halls of Castle Giovesse, stopping maids in their washing and guards in their conversation. One of her women came up the narrow stairs to see her mistress, but her chief guard Zuuk stood at the doorway and shook his head.\n\n""She's just heard that her son is dead,"" he said quietly."

Her earlier skirmish with the lone wolf had taken more from her than she thought. She dipped her hands into the cool water and began to drink.

Selliel saw the three tiny does behind him. She froze. Then the buck walked calmly toward her and nudged the bow away.\n\nSelliel hesitantly put her hand out. The buck licked her palm gently. Then it snorted and walked back to the forest. The does followed the buck. Selliel did not.\n\n*****\n\nShe returned to the cliff top. The wolf was where she had left it, untouched by scavengers. She skinned it, harvested its meat, and stuffed it into her pack. Then she began the long walk home."

msgid "The soldier waited with bated breath. His hand gripped the blade haft tightly, turning his knuckles ashen white. His sword arm shook nervously as he stood behind the others, waiting for his chance to strike. Any moment now, the Alessian patrol would pass by. He had to wonder, though, what exactly had he gotten himself into?\n\nHis name was Erric Deleyn, and even he didn't know where his part in all of this began. An innkeeper's son barely of age, his family tree was literally dripping with proud horse breeders, farm hands, and—like his father—cooks. He had as much warrior's blood flowing through his body as he did muscles in his arms and back. Which is to say, almost none. Yet here he stood, armor hanging loosely on his thin frame, holding a sword he barely knew how to use.\n\nErric wished he could say that he had joined the militia to gain revenge or honor. That his father and mother had been slain in an Alessian attack. Or that the love of his life was taken to the slave camps of the evil Alessians. By the Eight, he would have settled for any excuse in which the Alessians wronged his family.\n\nBut, no. Erric's family was safe and sound. His pleasantly plump parents happily ran an inn in one of the small towns that dotted High Rock. And the love of his life? Well, there was none. He had never felt the embrace of a damsel or tasted the kiss of serving wench. So why did he want to fight the Alessians? Well, he had heard bad things about them, but as far as he was concerned it was all rumors and innuendo. He had lived a sheltered life.\n\nNo, the reason Erric stood next to Kish'na the fierce Khajiiti maiden and Calinden the handsome Ayleid knight wasn't quite so lofty. It was more mere chance and accident that had led him to this time and place. He had been sneaking off into the woods at night to practice the same fighting techniques he'd seen the city guard practice. He wanted to learn how to fight, but he didn't want anyone to see him doing it. There was too much of a chance someone would make fun of him. After all, he was just a cook's son. So every night Erric would grab his rusty sword and mismatched armor and head into the woods to train.\n\nBut tonight would be different. There would be no more practice.\n\nAs Erric ran through back alleys to reach the hole in the wall he knew so well, he turned a corner and almost ran right into them. His breath caught in his throat when he saw them. A handful of men and women from different cultures all huddled together, whispering. They wore impressive uniforms and carried even more impressive weapons.\n\nCautiously he approached them, but Erric had little skill or grace. He tripped over his own feet and landed in a puddle with a loud splash. The warriors turned as one, weapons drawn and eyes hard. But they saw his armor and weapon and assumed he was there to meet them. Being too afraid to say otherwise, Erric was welcomed into their group.\n\nIt was simply a case of mistaken identity. Later, he might have called it fate.\n\nBut tonight? Tonight was the night Erric Deleyn was going to die. And that event would change the world around him forever."

msgid "Let me tell the tale of the Thief of Virtue. In the land of Hammerfell in the city of Sutch there lived a Baron who was quite wealthy. He was a noted collector of rare coins. The Baroness Veronique found the whole thing quite tedious. However, she did appreciate the lifestyle that the Baron's wealth provided.\n \nRavius Terinus was a noted thief. He claimed to be a master thief in the mythical guild of thieves. However, that was most likely just braggadocio. The only known Thieves Guild was wiped out over 450 years ago.\n \nRavius decided that the Baron should share his wealth. Specifically he should share it with Ravius. The wily thief crept into the Baron's castle one night intending to do just that.\n \nThe walls of the castle were noted for their height and unscalability. Ravius cleverly used an Arrow of Penetration to affix a rope to the top of the battlements. Once on the battlements, he had to evade the Baron's guards. By hiding in the shadows of the crenelations, he was able to work his way to the keep undetected.\n \nEntering the keep was child's play for a thief of his caliber. However, a cunning lock with no less than 13 pins protected the private quarters of the Baron. Ravius broke only 9 lockpicks to open it. Using only a fork, a bit of string, and a wineskin, he disabled the seven traps guarding the Baron's coin collection. Truly Ravius was a master among thieves.\n \nWith the coins safely in his grasp, Ravius began his escape only to find the way blocked. The Baron had found the opened door and was raising the guard to scour the castle. Ravius fled deeper into the castle, one step ahead of the questing guards.\n \nHis only way out led through the boudoir of Baroness Veronique. He entered to find the lady preparing for bed. Now it should be said at this point that Ravius was noted for his handsome looks, while the Baroness was noted for her plainness. Both of these facts were immediately recognized by each of the pair.\n \n""Dost thou come to plunder my virtue?"" asked the lady, all a-tremble.\n \n""Nay, fair lady,"" Ravius said, thinking quickly. ""Plunder be a harsh term to ply upon such a delicate flower as your virtue.""\n \n""I see thou hast made off with mine husband's precious coins."" Ravius looked deeply into her eyes and saw the only path by which he would escape this night with his life. It would require a double sacrifice.\n \n""Though these coins are of rarest value, I have now found a treasure that is beyond all value,"" Ravius said smoothly. ""Tell me, oh beauteous one, why dost thy husband set seven deadly traps around these tawdry coins, but only a simple lock upon the door of his virtuous wife?""\n \n""Ignace protects those things that are dearest to him,"" Veronique replied with ire.\n \n""I would give all the gold in my possession to spend but a moment basking in your radiance.""\n \nWith that Ravius set down the coins he had worked so hard to steal. The Baroness swooned into his arms. When the captain of the guard asked to search her quarters, she hid Ravius most skillfully. She turned over the coins, claiming the thief dropped them when he fled out the window.\n \nWith that sacrifice made, Ravius steeled himself for the second. He robbed the lady Veronique of her virtue that night. He robbed her of it several times, lasting well into the wee hours of the morning. Exhausted, yet sated, he stole away in the pre-dawn hours."

Had he been in a better mood, the sight would have been breathtaking. As it was, he could only think that in practical terms, a small village like this would have meager provisions for himself and his horse.\n\nHe rode down into the main square, where an inn called the Eagle's Cry stood. Directing the stable boy to house and feed his horse, Cassyr walked into the inn and was surprised by its ambience. A minstrel he had heard play once in Gilverdale was performing a jaunty old tune to the clapping of the mountain men. Such forced merriment was not what Cassyr wanted at that moment. A glum Dunmer woman was seated at the only table far from the noise, so he took his drink there and sat down without invitation. It was only when he did so that he noticed that she was holding a newborn baby.\n\n""I've just come from Morrowind,"" he said rather awkwardly, lowering his voice. ""I've been fighting for Vivec and the Duke of Mournhold against the Imperial Army. A traitor to my people, I guess you'd call me.""\n\n""I am also a traitor to my people,"" said the woman, holding up her hand which was scarred with a branded symbol. ""It means that I can never go back to my homeland.""\n\n""Well, you're not thinking of staying here, are you?"" laughed Cassyr. ""It's certainly quaint, but come wintertide, there's going to be snow up to your eyelashes. It's no place for a new baby. What is her name?""\n\n""Bosriel. It means 'Beauty of the Forest.' Where are you going?""\n\n""Dwynnen, on the bay in High Rock. You're welcome to join me, I could use the company."" He held out his hand. ""Cassyr Whitley.""\n\n""Turala,"" said the woman after a pause. She was going to use her family's name first, as is tradition, but she realized that it was no longer her name. ""I would love to accompany you, thank you.""\n\n19 Last Seed, 2920\nAld Lambasi, Morrowind\n\nFive men and two women stood in the silence of the Great Room of the castle, the only sound the scrawl of quill on parchment and the gentle tapping of rain on the large picture window. As the Prince set the seal of Cyrodiil on the document, the peace was made official. The Duke of Mournhold broke out in a roar of delight, ordering wine brought in to commemorate the end of eighty years of war.\n\nOnly Sotha Sil stood apart from the group. His face betrayed no emotion. Those who knew him best knew he did not believe in endings or beginnings, but in the continuous cycle of which this was but a small part.\n\n""My Prince,"" said the castle steward, unhappy at breaking the celebration. ""There is a messenger here from your mother, the Empress. He asked to see your father, but as he did not arrive—""\n\nJuilek excused himself and went to speak with the messenger.\n\n""The Empress does not live in the Imperial City?"" asked Vivec.\n\n""No,"" said Almalexia, shaking her head sadly. ""Her husband has imprisoned her in Black Marsh, fearing that she was plotting a revolution against him. She is extremely wealthy and has powerful allies in the western Colovian estates so he could not marry another or have her executed. They've been at an impasse for the last seventeen years since Juilek was a child.""\n\nThe Prince returned a few minutes later. His face betrayed his anxiety, though he took troubles to hide it.\n\n""My mother needs me,"" he said simply. ""I'm afraid I must leave at once. If I may have a copy of the treaty, I will bring it with me to show the Empress the good we have done today, and then I will carry it on to the Imperial City so it may be made official.""\n\nPrince Juilek left with the fond farewells of the Three of Morrowind. As they watched him ride out into the rainswept night south towards Black Marsh, Vivec said, ""Tamriel will be much healed when he has the throne."""

As she fell, Selliel grabbed her hunting knife and thrust it into the earth wall.\n\nThe knife slowed her descent, but not enough.

Studded with statuary and fountains, the north gardens fit the Emperor's mood, as well as being the coolest acreage in the City during the heat of summertide. Austere, tiered flowerbeds of blue-gray and green towered all around them as they walked.\n\n""Vivec has agreed to the Prince's terms for peace,"" said Reman. ""My son will be returning in two weeks' time.""\n\n""This is excellent news,"" said the Potentate carefully. ""I hope the Dunmer will honor the terms. We might have asked for more. The fortress at Black Gate, for example. But I suppose the Prince knows what is reasonable. He would not cripple the Empire just for peace.""\n\n""I have been thinking lately of Rijja and what caused her to plot against my life,"" said the Emperor, pausing to admire a statue of the Slave Queen Alessia before continuing. ""The only thing I can think of to account for it is that she admired my son too much. She may have loved me for my power and my personality, but he, after all, is young and handsome and will one day inherit my throne. She must have thought that if I were dead, she could have an Emperor who had both youth and power.""\n\n""The Prince … was in on this plot?"" asked Versidue-Shaie. It was a difficult game to play, anticipating where the Emperor's paranoia would strike next.\n\n""Oh, I don't think so,"" said Reman, smiling. ""No, my son loves me well.""\n\n""Are you aware that Corda, Rijja's sister, is an initiate of the Morwha conservatorium in Hegathe?"" asked the Potentate.\n\n""Morwha?"" asked the Emperor. ""I've forgotten: which god is that?""\n\n""Lusty fertility goddess of the Yokudans,"" replied the Potentate. ""But not too lusty, like Dibella. Demure, but certainly sexual.""\n\n""I am through with lusty women. The Empress, Rijja, all too lusty, a lust for love leads to a lust for power,"" the Emperor shrugged his shoulders. ""But a priestess-in-training with a certain healthy appetite sounds ideal. Now what were you saying about the Black Gate?""\n\n6 Sun's Height, 2920\nThurzo Fortress, Cyrodiil\n\nRijja stood quietly looking at the cold stone floor while the Emperor spoke. He had never before seen her so pale and joyless. She might at least be pleased that she was being freed, being returned to her homeland. Why, if she left now, she could be in Hammerfell by the Merchant's Festival. Nothing he said seemed to register any reaction from her. A month and a half's stay in Thurzo Fortress seemed to have killed her spirit.\n\n""I was thinking,"" said the Emperor at last. ""Of having your younger sister Corda up to the palace for a time. I think she would prefer it over the conservatorium in Hegathe, don't you?""\n\nReaction, at last. Rijja looked at the Emperor with animal hatred, flinging herself at him in a rage. Her fingernails had grown long since her imprisonment and she raked them across his face, into his eyes. He howled with pain, and his guards pulled her off, pummeling her with blows from the back of their swords, until she was knocked unconscious.\n\nA healer was called at once, but the Emperor Reman III had lost his right eye.\n\n23 Sun's Height, 2920\nBalmora, Morrowind\n\nVivec pulled himself from the water, feeling the heat of the day washed from his skin, taking a towel from one of his servants. Sotha Sil watched his old friend from the balcony.\n\n""It looks like you've picked up a few more scars since I last saw you,"" said the sorcerer.\n\n""Azura grant it that I have no more for a while,"" laughed Vivec. ""When did you arrive?""\n\n""A little over an hour ago,"" said Sotha Sil, walking down the stairs to the water's edge. ""I thought I was coming to end a war, but it seems you've done it without me.""\n\n""Yes, eighty years is long enough for ceaseless battle,"" replied Vivec, embracing Sotha Sil. ""We made concessions, but so did they. When the old Emperor is dead, we may be entering a golden age. Prince Juilek is very wise for his age. Where is Almalexia?""\n\n""Collecting the Duke of Mournhold. They should be here tomorrow afternoon.""\n\nThe men were distracted at a sight from around the corner of the palace—a rider was approaching through the town, heading for the front steps. It was evident that the woman had been riding hard for some time. They met her in the study, where she burst in, breathing hard.\n\n""We have been betrayed,"" she gasped. ""The Imperial Army has seized the Black Gate."""

The town guard had to carry torches to make their rounds; but the man who came to call at my chapel carried no light with him. I came to learn that Movarth Piquine could see in the dark almost as well as the light—an excellent talent, considering his interests were exclusively nocturnal.\n \nOne of my acolytes brought him to me, and from the look of him, I at first thought he was in need of healing. He was pale to the point of opalescence with a face that looked like it had once been very handsome before some unspeakable suffering. The dark circles under his eyes bespoke exhaustion, but the eyes themselves were alert, intense, almost insane.\n \nHe quickly dismissed my notion that he himself was ill, though he did want to discuss a specific disease.\n \n""Vampirism,"" he said, and then paused at my quizzical look.

I asked.\n \n""Dead,"" Movarth replied coldly, and then, responding to my shock, he added to perhaps soften the blow. ""She said your advice was invaluable, at least for the one vampire.

""Why do you think it would be enough for you?""\n \n""I was a teacher once myself, years ago,"" he said. ""Not in a university. A trainer in the Fighters Guild.

For hours, he asked questions and I answered what I could, but he never volunteered any information about himself. He never smiled. He only studied me with those intense eyes of his, committing every word I said to memory.\n \nFinally, I turned the questioning around. ""You said you were a trainer at the Fighters Guild. Are you on an assignment for them?""\n \n""No,"" he said curtly, and finally I could detect some weariness in those feverish eyes of his. ""I would like to continue this tomorrow night, if I could. I need to get some sleep and absorb this.""\n \n""You sleep during the day,"" I smiled.\n \nTo my surprise, he returned the smile, though it was more of a grimace.

msgid "By Taleon Mythmaker\n\nIn life, Yoregg Grass-Grazer was a rogue and a scoundrel. He made a fortune, first as a bandit and a raider, and later as a landowner and businessman. In all of his roles, he more than earned the name he was given—Yoregg the Bastard. By all accounts, he relished the name, and even had it applied to his tomb when his long and vile life finally came to an end. This is the tale of how that came to be.\n\nYoregg the Bastard was among the oldest men in Windhelm, but he was as strong and as vigorous as anyone half his age. He owned many of the shops and market stalls in the city, as well as the tavern, the stables, and most of the farms beyond the western walls. But ""own"" might be too soft a word. Yoregg ruled over his holdings with as much power and authority as any thane or jarl in the land. If you worked for Yoregg, he treated you little better than a servant or a slave, and if you rented land from him, he made sure you acted as a humble vassal in his vaunted presence.\n\nIn other words, he was a pure and total bastard.\n\nWhile Yoregg continued to fortify his fortune and terrorize the people beholden to him, he also began work on his tomb. He chose a location far to the southeast, in the region where he made his first fortune as a bandit and a raider when he was a very young man. The old hide-out that he used as a headquarters in those days of pillaging and plunder was located within a series of caves in the mountains separating southern Eastmarch from the Rift. He hired the talented stoneworker, Shreg Rock-Fingers, to turn the unadorned caves into a suitable resting place for the Bastard. She didn't disappoint.\n\nWhen Yoregg traveled to the tomb to see what Shreg had accomplished, he made one of the few blatant mistakes of his life. And it was a mistake that was about to cost him dearly. The truth was, Shreg had a grudge against the Bastard. Of course, almost everyone who had ever met the Bastard had a grudge or a grievance or an ax to grind with the intolerable man. But Shreg's grudge was personal and deep seated. \n\nYoregg had squeezed gold from Shreg's parents for decades while they toiled and worked the farm he rented to them. She remembered how they suffered, but rarely complained. How almost every coin they earned had to go to the Bastard to pay off their debt. But it was never enough. And when Mother fell sick, Shreg could only watch as Yoregg and his goons unceremoniously tossed her family from their land for failing to make their regular payments. On that day, Shreg swore she would find a way to make the Bastard suffer.\n\nYoregg was thrilled with the work Shreg had done on the tomb. It was regal and vast, and it appealed to his overblown sense of self-worth and status. He adored the raised dais and the altar that were the focal point of the main burial chamber, and the high ceiling above gave the place a majestic air that played to the Bastard's ego. ""Yes,"" he declared, ""this will do nicely.""\n\nShreg led the old man to an open sarcophagus made of chisiled stone that stood upright against one wall. ""Would you care to step inside, my lord,"" Shreg asked as innocently as she could manage, ""so that I can take an accurate measure?"" Yoregg beamed. He couldn't wait to step inside the ornate stone casket. But Yoregg was still a big man, even at his advanced age, and the inside of the box was tight and snug. \n\n""Squeeze in, my lord,"" Shreg said, shoving at one of Yoregg's broad shoulders. Finally, after a bit of a struggle and some judicious contortions by the old man, Shreg was able to swing the massive lid of the sarcophagus closed.\n\n""How does it feel, my lord?"" Shreg asked sweetly.\n\n""It's a bit cramped,"" Yoregg admitted. ""And very dark.""\n\n""Just like your soul, my lord,"" Shreg shouted, making sure he could hear her through the stone.\n\n""Excuse me? What did you say?"" Yoregg demanded, his voice reflecting confusion and anger and a slight hint of blossoming fear.\n\n""This is for my parents, you bastard,"" Shreg declared as she sealed the lid of the sarcophagus. ""Enjoy your eternal rest, my lord.""\n\nShreg could hear the Bastard's cries echo through the chambers as she exited the tomb. She hoped it took him a long, long time to die."

After a few bottles of mead and feeling encouraged, he ran off waving his bow, telling me he would return with a fine buck before the sun fully set. I decided to make camp, figuring my cousin would soon tire of hunting as evening fell.\n\nThe snow started just as I finished off another bottle of mead and crawled into our small tent. Not long after, I heard some strange beast thrashing about in the woods nearby. I called out, thinking it was Knudek. An eerie moan was the only response, making the hairs on my arms stand up. \n\nI grabbed my bow, determined to face the creature. As I leapt out, a strong gust of wind caused the snow to swirl. I became tangled up in my tent and pitched forward, my hand landing in the small campfire. I screamed in surprise, startling the creature as it paused near the camp. \n\nThe creature was too small to be a frost troll. It made some odd noises and I yelled at it to go away. I could not see it clearly because of the snow and my eyes streaming from the pain of my burns. The creature made more unintelligible noises. \n\nIn desperation and in fear for my life, I grabbed a handful of hot embers with my uninjured hand and flung them at the creature's head. The pain caused me to scream even louder than the creature, which began to thrash around, flailing into a snowdrift. I managed to stand as the creature struggled to its feet. It was pale-skinned and hunched. It did not attack me. The pain in my hands had rendered me speechless.\n\nIn spite of my pain, I decided to make a run for it. I fled toward Fort Amol. Luckily, I ran into a group of soldiers heading back to the fort. They got me to healer, who tended to my hands. Knudek showed up several days later. He said he'd gotten lost, fallen and broken his arm, and was later attacked by a rogue mage who flung fireballs at him repeatedly. He was sorry he missed the Ice Elf. He wants to go looking for it again, after we both heal."

msgid "Ehtelar awoke in darkness, faint rivulets of falling sand powdering her brow. Memories of her short battle in the ruins above flashed through her mind. \n\nRahad, the Redguard merchant who had accompanied her into the desert, was dead, taken unaware in the ruins above. His sword lay buried in the skull of the creature that did him in.\n\nShe remembered the sickening crunch it had made as steel met skull, the hideous scraping vibration in her arm as she drove it home. Then the ground had opened up, devouring the world to send her tumbling into the abyssal void below.\n\nHow far had she fallen, and for how long? Sand, then stars had accompanied her fall before the deepest darkness had swallowed her up, but she had no memory of landing.\n\nDeprived of sight, she felt around her to gather what she could of her surroundings. While her arms were free, her legs felt leaden under the sand that covered them and she immediately began excavating herself.\n\nAs she worked, the metallic tang of blood filled the air. Feeling her leg, she felt the warm grating wet that could only be sand in clotting blood.\n\nCursing under her breath, she undid her belt and cinched its cold leather just above the gouge in her calf. Feeling her way in the dark, she tore several strips of fabric from her tunic, winding it surely about the wound.\n\nIf it held, her handiwork would stop the bleeding, but she had no potions to stave off infection. She would need to find a way back to her caravan soon.\n\nStill blinded by the depthless shadow around her, she exhumed her other leg and began feeling in her pack for a token Rahad had given her.\n\n""Nights in the waste are deeper than Satakal's belly,"" he'd said. ""When you lose yourself, pray to Tall Papa. He will show you the way.""\n\nHer fingers closed about the tiny coin. Pulling it from its hiding place, she closed her eyes and mouthed, ""Ruptga."" Eyelids flushing coral from the sudden light, she opened them to survey the cavern sprawling out before her.\n\nHeavy stone blocks, shattered from the fall, lay in shards all around her. Further out, enormous pillars reached like trees up into darkness, casting long shadows out into the black.\n\nLooking up, her breath caught in her throat as the bright eyes and maw of the lamia gaped out at her from the dark. Though unmoving, Rahad's sword still embedded in its skull, it was half a hundred heartbeats before she could look away.\n\nStill recovering from the shock, she resumed her search and found several long, hooked spears scattered about the sand. Taking one up, she grabbed hold of her pack and slid down the lonely dune.\n\nBoots met stone and she braced her spear against one of the mighty pillars. Using it to steady herself, she stood upright.\n\nShe took a moment to test her wounded leg. When it became clear it would not fail her, she gathered up her pack, dusted herself off, and struck out into the darkness.\n\nIn the deep quiet, muffled by the vast expanse of nothing reaching out around her, her passage was marked only by a steady staccato of steel on stone."

msgid "2920, The Last Year of the First Era\n\nBy Carlovac Townway\n\n9 Hearth Fire, 2920\nPhrygias, High Rock\n\nThe strange trees on all sides resembled knobby piles crowned with great bursts of reds, yellows, and oranges, like insect mounds caught fire. The Wrothgarian mountains were fading into the misty afternoon. Turala marveled at the sight, so alien, so different from Morrowind, as she plodded the horse forward into an open pasture. Behind her, head nodding against his chest, Cassyr slept, cradling Bosriel. For a moment, Turala considered jumping the low painted fence that crossed the field, but she thought better of it. Let Cassyr sleep for a few more hours before giving him the reins.\n\nAs the horse passed into the field, Turala saw the small green house on the next hill, half-hidden in forest. So picturesque was the image, she felt herself lull into a pleasant half-sleeping state. A blast of a horn brought her back to reality with a shudder. Cassyr opened his eyes.\n\n""Where are we?"" he hissed.\n\n""I don't know,"" Turala stammered, wide-eyed. ""What is that sound?""\n\n""Orcs,"" he whispered. ""A hunting party. Head for the thicket quickly.""\n\nTurala trotted the horse into the small collection of trees. Cassyr handed her the child and dismounted. He began pulling their bags off next, throwing them into the bushes. A sound started then, a distant rumbling of footfall, growing louder and closer. Turala climbed off carefully and helped Cassyr unburden the horse. All the while, Bosriel watched open-eyed. Turala sometimes worried that her baby never cried. Now she was grateful for it. With the last of the luggage off, Cassyr slapped the horse's rear, sending it galloping into the field. Taking Turala's hand, he hunkered down in the bushes.\n\n""With luck,"" he murmured. ""They'll think she's wild or belongs to the farm and won't go looking for the rider.""\n\nAs he spoke, a horde of Orcs surged into the field, blasting their horns. Turala had seen Orcs before, but never in such abundance, never with such bestial confidence. Roaring with delight at the horse and its confused state, they hastened past the timber where Cassyr, Turala, and Bosriel hid. The wildflowers flew into the air at their stampede, powdering the air with seeds. Turala tried to hold back a sneeze, and thought she succeeded. One of the Orcs heard something though, and brought another with him to investigate.\n\nCassyr quietly unsheathed his sword, mustering all the confidence he could. His skills, such as they were, were in spying, not combat, but he vowed to protect Turala and her babe for as long as he could. Perhaps he would slay these two, he reasoned, but not before they cried out and brought the rest of the horde.\n\nSuddenly, something invisible swept through the bushes like a wind. The Orcs flew backwards, falling dead on their backs. Turala turned and saw a wrinkled crone with bright red hair emerge from a nearby bush.\n\n""I thought you were going to bring them right to me,"" she whispered, smiling. ""Best come with me.""\n\nThe three followed the old woman through a deep crevasse of bramble bushes that ran through the field toward the house on the hill. As they emerged on the other side, the woman turned to look at the Orcs feasting on the remains of the horse, a blood-soaked orgy to the beat of multiple horns.\n\n""That horse yours?"" she asked. When Cassyr nodded, she laughed loudly. ""That's rich meat, that is. Those monsters'll have bellyaches and flatulence in the morning. Serves 'em right.""\n\n""Shouldn't we keep moving?"" whispered Turala, unnerved by the woman's laughter.\n\n""They won't come up here,"" she grinned, looking at Bosriel who smiled back. ""They're too afraid of us.""\n\nTurala turned to Cassyr, who shook his head. ""Witches. Am I correct in assuming that this is Old Barbyn's Farm, the home of the Skeffington Coven?""\n\n""You are, pet,"" the old woman giggled girlishly, pleased to be so infamous. ""I am Mynista Skeffington.""\n\n""What did you do to those Orcs?"" asked Turala. ""Back there in the thicket?""\n\n""Spirit fist right side the head,"" Mynista said, continuing the climb up the hill. Ahead of them was the farmhouse grounds, a well, a chicken coop, a pond, women of all ages doing chores, the laughter of children at play. The old woman turned and saw that Turala did not understand. ""Don't you have witches where you come from, child?""\n\n""None that I know of,"" she said.\n\n""There are all sorts of wielders of magic in Tamriel,"" she explained. ""The Psijics study magic like it's their painful duty. The battlemages in the army on the other end of the scale hurl spells like arrows. We witches commune and conjure and celebrate. To fell those Orcs, I merely whispered to the spirits of the air, Amaro, Pina, Tallatha, the fingers of Kynareth, and the breath of the world, with whom I have an intimate acquaintance, to smack those bastards dead. You see, conjuration is not about might, or solving riddles, or agonizing over musty old scrolls. It's about fostering relations. Being friendly, you might say.""\n\n""Well, we certainly appreciate you being friendly with us,"" said Cassyr.\n\n""As well you might,"" coughed Mynista. ""Your kind destroyed the Orc homeland two thousand years ago. Before that, they never came all the way up here and bothered us. Now let's get you cleaned up and fed.""\n\nWith that, Mynista led them into the farm, and Turala met the family of the Skeffington Coven."

msgid "By Anonymous\n\nThe next day, he did return with more questions, these ones very specific. He wanted to know about the vampires of eastern Skyrim. I told him about the most powerful tribe, the Volkihar, paranoid and cruel, whose very breath could freeze their victims' blood in the veins. I explained to him how they lived beneath the ice of remote and haunted lakes, never venturing into the world of men except to feed.\n \nMovarth Piquine listened carefully, and asked more questions into the night, until at last he was ready to leave.\n \n""I will not see you for a few days,"" he said. ""But I will return, and tell you how helpful your information has been.""\n \nTrue to his word, the man returned to my chapel shortly after midnight four days later. There was a fresh scar on his cheek, but he was smiling that grim but satisfied smile of his.\n \n""Your advice helped me very much,"" he said. ""But you should know that the Volkihar have an additional ability you didn't mention. They can reach through the ice of their lakes without breaking it. It was quite a nasty surprise, being grabbed from below without any warning.""\n \n""How remarkable,"" I said with a laugh. ""And terrifying. You're lucky you survived.""\n \n""I don't believe in luck. I believe in knowledge and training. Your information helped me, and my skill at melee combat sealed the bloodsucker's fate. I've never believed in weaponry of any kind. Too many unknowns. Even the best swordsmith has created a flawed blade, but you know what your body is capable of. I know I can land a thousand blows without losing my balance, provided I get the first strike.""\n \n""The first strike?"" I murmured. ""So you must never be surprised.""\n \n""That is why I came to you,"" said Movarth. ""You know more than anyone alive about these monsters, in all their cursed varieties across the land. Now you must tell me about the vampires of northern Valenwood.""\n \nI did as he asked, and once again, his questions taxed my knowledge. There were many tribes to cover. The Bonsamu who were indistinguishable from Bosmer except when seen by candlelight. The Keerilth who could disintegrate into mist. The Yekef who swallowed men whole. The dread Telboth who preyed on children, eventually taking their place in the family, waiting patiently for years before murdering them all in their unnatural hunger.\n \nOnce again, he bade me farewell, promising to return in a few weeks, and once again, he returned as he said, just after midnight. This time, Movarth had no fresh scars, but he again had new information.\n \n""You were wrong about the Keerilth being unable to vaporize when pushed underwater,"" he said, patting my shoulder fondly. ""Fortunately, they cannot travel far in their mist form, and I was able to track it down.""\n \n""You must have surprised it fearfully. Your field knowledge is becoming impressive,"" I said. ""I should have had an acolyte like you decades ago.""\n \n""Now, tell me,"" he said. ""Of the vampires of Cyrodiil.""\n \nI told him what I could. There was but one tribe in Cyrodiil, a powerful clan who had ousted all other competitors, much like the Imperials themselves had done. Their true name was unknown, lost in history, but they were experts at concealment. If they kept themselves well-fed, they were indistinguishable from living persons. They were cultured, more civilized than the vampires of the provinces, preferring to feed on victims while they were asleep, unaware.\n \n""They will be difficult to surprise,"" Movarth frowned. ""But I will seek one out, and tell you what I learn. And then you will tell me of the vampires of High Rock, and Hammerfell, and Elsweyr, and Black Marsh, and Morrowind, and the Summerset Isles, yes?""\n \nI nodded, knowing then that this was a man on an eternal quest. He wouldn't be satisfied with but the barest hint of how things were. He needed to know it all.\n \nHe did not return for a month, and on the night that he did, I could see his frustration and despair, though there were no lights burning in my chapel.\n \n""I failed,"" he said, as I lit a candle. ""You were right. I could not find a single one.""\n \nI brought the light up to my face and smiled. He was surprised, even stunned by the pallor of my flesh, the dark hunger in my ageless eyes, and the teeth. Oh, yes, I think the teeth definitely surprised the man who could not afford to be surprised.\n \n""I haven't fed in seventy-two hours,"" I explained, as I fell on him. He did not land the first blow or the last."

His general demeanor was less aloof than others of his kind, though he still had that somewhat mistrustful air about him. I offered him some wine and bread at my campsite, and he seemed grateful enough for a little company.\n\nHe claimed to be a ""Mabrigash,"" which I took to be some sort of Ashlander clan off-shoot, though I was unaware that any clan had traveled this far south from Vvardenfell. I asked him about his journey, and he said he was going nowhere and anywhere. He said he couldn't return to the Vale.\n\nWhen I asked, he told me the Vale was his home. He claimed his clan protected snakes and ghosts in this mysterious place. In turn, a ""Ghost Snake"" watched over the clan. Now, he was getting a bit drunk by this time, as we shared more than a bottle or two, but he assured me there was indeed a Ghost Snake.  I asked why he left. He was silent for a long while. Finally, he mumbled that he had failed his trial. I asked what he meant and he said that he had not walked the path, that his courage had failed him and he had fled. ""Now I can never return,"" he told me. ""I have shamed my family and dishonored my clan.""  \n\nHe started to weep softly, so I pretended to busy myself with my packs, and a minute later he was snoring. Poor fellow. Obviously some primitive ritual or tribal rite had gone awry. I was determined to encourage him to return home when we broke camp in the morning. However, when I awoke at dawn, he was gone. \n\nI miss you as always. I will write again in a few days.\n\n— Thorgo"

msgid "2920: The Last Year of the First Era\n\nBy Carlovac Townway\n\n14 Morning Star\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\n\nThe chimes proclaiming South Wind's Prayer echoed through the wide boulevards and gardens of the Imperial City, calling all to their temples. The Emperor Reman III always attended a service at the Temple of the One, while his son and heir Prince Juilek found it more political to attend a service at a different temple for each religious holiday. This year, it was at the cathedral Benevolence of Mara.\n\nThe Benevolence's services were mercifully short, but it was not until well after noon that the Emperor was able to return to the palace. By then, the arena combatants were impatiently waiting for the start of the ceremony. The crowd was far less restless, as the Potentate Versidue-Shaie had arranged for a demonstration from a troupe of Khajiiti acrobats.\n\n""Your religion is so much more convenient than mine,"" said the Emperor to his Potentate by way of an apology. ""What is the first game?""\n\n""A one-on-one battle between two able warriors,"" said the Potentate, his scaly skin catching the sun as he rose. ""Armed befitting their culture.""\n\n""Sounds good,"" said the Emperor and clapped his hands. ""Let the sport commence!""\n\nAs soon as he saw the two warriors enter the arena to the roar of the crowd, Emperor Reman III remembered that he had agreed to this several months before and forgotten about it. One combatant was the Potentate's son, Savirien-Chorak, a glistening ivory-yellow eel, gripping his katana and wakizashi with his thin, deceptively weak looking arms. The other was the Emperor's son, Prince Juilek, in ebony armor with a savage Orcish helm, shield and longsword at his side.\n\n""This will be fascinating to watch,"" hissed the Potentate, a wide grin across his narrow face. ""I don't know if I've even seen a Cyrodiil fight an Akaviri like this. Usually it's army against army. At last we can settle which philosophy is better—to create armor to combat swords as your people do, or to create swords to combat armor as mine do.""\n\nNo one in the crowd, aside from a few scattered Akaviri counselors and the Potentate himself, wanted Savirien-Chorak to win, but there was a collective intake of breath at the sight of his graceful movements. His swords seemed to be a part of him, a tail coming from his arms to match the one behind him. It was a trick of counterbalance, allowing the young serpent man to roll up into a circle and spin into the center of the ring in offensive position. The Prince had to plod forward the less impressive traditional way.\n\nAs they sprang at each other, the crowd bellowed with delight. The Akaviri was like a moon in orbit around the Prince, effortlessly springing over his shoulder to attempt a blow from behind, but the Prince whirled around quickly to block with his shield. His counter-strike met only air as his foe fell flat to the ground and slithered between his legs, tripping him. The Prince fell to the ground with a resounding crash.\n\nMetal and air melted together as Savirien-Chorak rained strike after strike upon the Prince, who blocked every one with his shield.\n\n""We don't have shields in our culture,"" murmured Versidue-Shaie to the Emperor. ""It seems strange to my boy, I imagine. In our country, if you don't want to get hit, you move out of the way.""\n\nWhen Savirien-Chorak was rearing back to begin another series of blinding attacks, the Prince kicked at his tail, sending him falling back momentarily. In an instant, he had rebounded, but the Prince was also back on his feet. The two circled one another, until the snake man spun forward, katana extended. The Prince saw his foe's plan, and blocked the katana with his longsword and the wakizashi with his shield. Its short punching blade impaled itself in the metal, and Savirien-Chorak was thrown off balance.\n\nThe Prince's longblade slashed across the Akaviri's chest and the sudden, intense pain caused him to drop both his weapons. In a moment, it was over. Savirien-Chorak was prostate in the dust with the Prince's longsword at his throat.\n\n""The game's over!"" shouted the Emperor, barely heard over the applause from the stadium.\n\nThe Prince grinned and helped Savirien-Chorak up and over to a healer. The Emperor clapped his Potentate on the back, feeling relieved. He had not realized when the fight had begun how little chance he had given his son at victory.\n\n""He will make a fine warrior,"" said Versidue-Shaie. ""And a great emperor.""\n\n""Just remember,"" laughed the Emperor. ""You Akaviri have a lot of showy moves, but if just one of our strikes comes through, it's all over for you.""\n\n""Oh, I'll remember that,"" nodded the Potentate.\n\nReman thought about that comment for the rest of the games, and had trouble fully enjoying himself. Could the Potentate be another enemy, just as the Empress had turned out to be? The matter would bear watching."

It was an idyllic site, lightly wooded where the water took the bend around a steep bluff to the east with a gorgeous wildflower meadow to the west. The strange flora of Morrowind met the strange flora of Cyrodiil on the border and commingled gloriously.\n\n""There will be time to sleep when you've finished!""\n\nThe soldiers had been hearing that all morning. It was not enough that they had been marching all night, now they were chopping down trees on the bluff and damming the river so its waters spilled over. Most of them had reached the point where they were too tired to complain about being tired.\n\n""Let me be certain I understand, my lord,"" said Vivec's lieutenant. ""We take the bluff so we can fire arrows and spells down on them from above. That's why we need all the trees cleared out. Damming the river floods the plain below so they'll be trudging through mud, which should hamper their movement.""\n\n""That's exactly half of it,"" said Vivec approvingly. He grabbed a nearby soldier who was hauling off the trees. ""Wait, I need you to break off the straightest, strongest branches of the trees and whittle them into spears. If you recruit a hundred or so others, it won't take you more than a few hours to make all we need.""\n\nThe soldier wearily did as he was bade. The men and women got to work, fashioning spears from the trees.\n\n""If you don't mind me asking,"" said the lieutenant. ""The soldiers don't need any more weapons. They're too tired to hold the ones they've got.""\n\n""These spears aren't for holding,"" said Vivec and whispered, ""If we tired them out today, they'll get a good night's sleep tonight,"" before he got to work supervising their work.\n\nIt was essential that they be sharp, of course, but equally important that they be well balanced and tapered proportionally. The perfect point for stability was a pyramid, not the conical point of some lances and spears. He had the men hurl the spears they had completed to test their strength, sharpness, and balance, forcing them to begin on a new one if they broke. Gradually, out of sheer exhaustion from doing it wrong, the men learned how to create the perfect wooden spears. Once they were through, he showed them how they were to be arranged and where.\n\nThat night, there was no drunken pre-battle carousing, and no nervous neophytes stayed up worrying about the battle to come. As soon as the sun sank beneath the wooded hills, the camp was at rest, but for the sentries.\n\n20 First Seed, 2920\nBodrum, Morrowind\n\nMiramor was exhausted. For last six days, he had gambled and whored all night and then marched all day. He was looking forward to the battle, but even more than that, he was looking forward to some rest afterwards. He was in the Emperor's command at the rear flank, which was good because it seemed unlikely that he would be killed. On the other hand, it meant traveling over the mud and waste the army ahead left in their wake.\n\nAs they began the trek through the wildflower field, Miramor and all the soldiers around him sank ankle-deep in cold mud. It was an effort to even keep moving. Far, far up ahead, he could see the vanguard of the army led by Lord Storig emerging from the meadow at the base of a bluff.\n\nThat was when it all happened.\n\nAn army of Dunmer appeared above the bluff like rising Daedra, pouring fire and floods of arrows down on the vanguard. Simultaneously, a company of men bearing the flag of the Duke of Mournhold galloped around the shore, disappearing along the shallow river's edge where it dipped to a timbered glen to the east. Warchief Ulaqth nearby on the right flank let out a bellow of revenge at the sight and gave chase. Queen Naghea sent her flank towards the embankment to the west to intercept the army on the bluff.\n\nThe Emperor could think of nothing to do. His troops were too bogged down to move forward quickly and join the battle. He ordered them to face east towards the timber, in case Mournhold's company was trying to circle around through the woods. They never came out, but many men, facing west, missed the battle entirely. Miramor kept his eyes on the bluff.\n\nA tall Dunmer he supposed must have been Vivec gave a signal, and the battlemages cast their spells at something to the west. From what transpired, Miramor deduced it was a dam. A great torrent of water spilled out, washing Naghea's left flank into the remains of the vanguard and the two together down river to the east.\n\nThe Emperor paused, as if waiting for his vanquished army to return, and then called a retreat. Miramor hid in the rushes until they had passed by and then waded as quietly as he could to the bluff.\n\nThe Morrowind army was retiring as well back to their camp. He could hear them celebrating above him as he padded along the shore. To the east, he saw the Imperial Army. They had been washed into a net of spears strung across the river, Naghea's left flank on Storig's vanguard on Ulaqth's right flank, bodies of hundreds of soldiers strung together like beads.\n\nMiramor took whatever valuables he could carry from the corpses and then ran down the river. He had to go many miles before the water was clear again, unpolluted by blood."

As every cub knows, Rajhin the Purring Liar, the Trickster God, and the Cat Who Walks cares little for stuffy aphorisms. He lives to challenge limits and stretch more than just the truth. To him, one shadow proved too few for his purposes ….\n\nFor one day, Rajhin found himself walking in the hot sun. He called out to Khenarthi to blow a breeze through his mane, but the Wind God was otherwise occupied. Rajhin then asked Alkosh to shorten the day and bring cool night. But Alkosh did not steal away the day at the Thief-God's word. None of Rajhin's further appeals brought relief, and so the trickster was left to his own devices.\n\nIn time, Rajhin came upon a wealthy merchant in the shade of a tall stone. ""My friend,"" Rajhin said, ""kindly share your resting place with this unfortunate one.""\n\nBut the merchant growled, ""There is no room, wanderer. The stone's shade is large enough for one, but not two!""\n\nRajhin saw the truth in this statement, rude as it was, and did not argue. Instead, he purred, ""Did you drop a bag of gold along the path? For this one passed such a treasure not a moment ago.""\n\nThe merchant's frown turned to surprise. In a moment, the fat one struggled to his feet. ""Why, I must have! Pray, tell me where you saw it and I shall leave my shady stone to you!""\n\nRajhin directed the greedy trader down the path whence he had come and the man hurried off. But as he went, the trickster saw the fat merchant's shadow easily dwarfed that of the stone.\n\n""Why should I settle for the egg when the hen stands before me?"" Rajhin mused. With a flick of a hidden knife, the thief-god cut the fat merchant's shadow away so cleanly that the greedy man didn't even notice.\n\nWithin moments, he tied the shadow's feet to his own and it spread out before him, opposite his own shadow. This cooled the Trickster God and hid him from the burning sun.\n\nLaughing, Rajhin continued down the road, his two shadows dancing before and behind him."

The air above it vibrated with the waves of heat. Though each student kept his or her face sturdy and emotionless, as a true Psijic should, their terror was nearly as palpable as the heat. Sotha Sil closed his eyes and uttered the charm of fire resistance. Slowly, he walked across the basin of leaping flames, climbing to the other side, unscathed. Not even his white robe had been burned.\n\n""The charm is intensified by the energy you bring to it, by your own skills, just as all spells are,"" he said. ""Your imagination and your willpower are the keys. There is no need for a spell to give you a resistance to air, or a resistance to flowers, and after you cast the charm, you must forget there is even a need for a spell to give you resistance to fire. Do not confuse what I am saying: resistance is not about ignoring the fire's reality. You will feel the substance of flame, the texture of it, its hunger, and even the heat of it, but you will know that it will not hurt or injure you.""\n\nThe students nodded and one by one, they cast the spell and made the walk through the fire. Some even went so far as to bend over and scoop up a handful of fire and feed it air, so it expanded like a bubble and melted through their fingers. Sotha Sil smiled. They were fighting their fear admirably.\n\nThe Chief Proctor Thargallith came running from the arbor arches, ""Sotha Sil! Almalexia has arrived on Artaeum. Iachesis told me to fetch you.""\n\nSotha Sil turned to Thargallith for only a moment, but he knew instantly from the screams what had transpired. The Nord lad Wellig had not cast the spell properly and was burning. The smell of scorched hair and flesh panicked the other students who were struggling to get out of the basin, pulling him with them, but the incline was too steep away from the entry points. With a wave of his hand, Sotha Sil extinguished the flame.\n\nWellig and several other students were burned, but not badly. The sorcerer cast a healing spell on them, before turning back to Thargallith.\n\n""I'll be with you in a moment, and give Almalexia the time to shake the road dust from her train,"" Sotha Sil turned back to the students, his voice flat. ""Fear does not break spells, but doubt and incompetence are the great enemies of any spellcaster. Master Wellig, you will pack your bags. I'll arrange for a boat to bring you to the mainland tomorrow morning.""\n\nThe sorcerer found Almalexia and Iachesis in the study, drinking hot tea, and laughing. She was more beautiful than he had remembered, though he had never before seen her so disheveled, wrapped in a blanket, dangling her damp long black tresses before the fire to dry. At Sotha Sil's approach, she leapt to her feet and embraced him.\n\n""Did you swim all the way from Morrowind?"" he smiled.\n\n""It's pouring rain from Skywatch down to the coast,"" she explained, returning his smile.\n\n""Only a half a league away, and it never rains here,"" said Iachesis proudly. ""Of course, I sometimes miss the excitement of Summerset, and sometimes even the mainland itself. Still, I'm always very impressed by anyone out there who gets anything accomplished. It is a world of distractions. Speaking of distractions, what's all this I hear about a war?""\n\n""You mean the one that's been bloodying the continent for the last eighty years, Master?"" asked Sotha Sil, amused.\n\n""I suppose that's the one I mean,"" said Iachesis with a shrug of his shoulders. ""How is that war going?""\n\n""We will lose it, unless I can convince Sotha Sil to leave Artaeum,"" said Almalexia, losing her smile. She had meant to wait and talk to her friend in private, but the old Altmer gave her courage to press on. ""I have had visions; I know it to be true.""\n\nSotha Sil was silent for a moment, and then looked at Iachesis, ""I must return to Morrowind.""\n\n""Knowing you, if you must do something, you will,"" sighed the old Master. ""The Psijics' way is not to be distracted. Wars are fought, Empires rise and fall. You must go, and so must we.""\n\n""What do you mean, Iachesis? You're leaving the island?""\n\n""No, the island will be leaving the sea,"" said Iachesis, his voice taking on a dreamy quality. ""In a few years, the mists will move over Artaeum and we will be gone. We are counselors by nature, and there are too many counselors in Tamriel as it is. No, we will go, and return when the land needs us again, perhaps in another age.""\n\nThe old Altmer struggles to his feet, and drained the last sip of his drink before leaving Sotha Sil and Almalexia alone: ""Don't miss the last boat."""

Lord Glavius had a luxurious villa, but it was not close to being large enough to house the entire army within its walls. Tents lined the hillsides, and the soldiers were flocking to enjoy his lordship's famous hot springs. Little wonder: winter chill still hung in the air.\n\n""Prince Juilek, your son, is not feeling well.""\n\nWhen Potentate Versidue-Shaie spoke, the Emperor jumped. How that Akaviri could slither across the grass without making a sound was a mystery to him.\n\n""Poisoned, I'd wager,"" grumbled Reman. ""See to it he gets a healer. I told him to hire a taster like I have, but the boy's headstrong. There are spies all around us, I know it.""\n\n""I believe you're right, Your Imperial Majesty,"" said Versidue-Shaie. ""These are treacherous times, and we must take precautions to see that Morrowind does not win this war, either on the field or by more insidious means. That is why I would suggest that you not lead the vanguard into battle. I know you would want to, as your illustrious ancestors Reman I, Brazollus Dor, and Reman II did, but I fear it would be foolhardy. I hope you do not mind me speaking frankly like this.""\n\n""No,"" nodded Reman. ""I think you're right. Who would lead the vanguard then?""\n\n""I would say Prince Juilek, if he were feeling better,"" replied the Akaviri. ""Failing that, Storig of Farrun, with Queen Naghea of Riverhold at left flank, and Warchief Ulaqth of Lilmoth at right flank.""\n\n""A Khajiit at left flank and an Argonian at right,"" frowned the Emperor. ""I never do trust beastfolk.""\n\nThe Potentate took no offense. He knew that ""beastfolk"" referred to the natives of Tamriel, not to the Tsaesci of Akavir like himself. ""I quite agree, Your Imperial Majesty, but you must agree that they hate the Dunmer. Ulaqth has a particular grudge after all the slave-raids on his lands by the Duke of Mournhold.""\n\nThe Emperor conceded it was so, and the Potentate retired. It was surprising, thought Reman, but for the first time, the Potentate seemed trustworthy. He was a good man to have on one's side.\n\n18 First Seed, 2920\nAld Erfoud, Morrowind\n\n""How far is the Imperial Army?"" asked Vivec.\n\n""Two days' march,"" replied his lieutenant. ""If we march all night tonight, we can get higher ground at the Pryai tomorrow morning. Our intelligence tells us the Emperor will be commanding the rear, Storig of Farrun has the vanguard, Naghea of Riverhold at left flank, and Ulaqth of Lilmoth at right flank.""\n\n""Ulaqth,"" whispered Vivec, an idea forming. ""Is this intelligence reliable? Who brought it to us?""\n\n""A Breton spy in the Imperial Army,"" said the lieutenant and gestured towards a young, sandy-haired man who stepped forward and bowed to Vivec.\n\n""What is your name and why is a Breton working for us against the Cyrodiils?"" asked Vivec, smiling.\n\n""My name is Cassyr Whitley of Dwynnen,"" said the man. ""And I am working for you because not everyone can say he spied for a god. And I understood it would be, well, profitable.""\n\nVivec laughed, ""It will be, if your information is accurate."""

Besides himself and his companion, there were only a couple of old seadogs in the shadowy room, and they were more unconscious from drink than aware of what was going on around them. The grime of the unwashed floor was something you felt rather than saw. Copious dust hung in the air, unmoving in the sparse rays of dying sunlight.\n\n""You have experience in heavy combat?"" asked Zuuk. ""The reward is good for this assignment, but the risks are great as well.""\n\n""Certainly I have combat experience,"" replied Miramor haughtily. ""I was at the Battle of Bodrum just two months ago. If you do your part and get the Emperor to ride through Dozsa Pass with a minimal escort on the day and the time we've discussed, I'll do my part. Just be certain that he's not traveling in disguise. I'm not going to slaughter every caravan that passes through in the hopes that it contains Emperor Reman.""\n\nZuuk smiled, and Miramor looked at himself in the Kothringi's reflective face. He liked the way he looked: the consummate, confident professional.\n\n""Agreed,"" said Zuuk. ""And then you shall have the rest of your gold.""\n\nZuuk placed the large chest onto the table between them. He stood up.\n\n""Wait before leaving,"" said Zuuk. ""I don't want you following me. Your employers wish to maintain their anonymity, if by chance you are caught and tortured later.""\n\n""Fine by me,"" said Miramor, ordering another grog.\n\nZuuk rode his mount through the cramped labyrinthine streets of Gideon, and both he and his horse were happy to pass through the gates into the country. The main road to Castle Giovese was flooded as it was every year in springtide, but Zuuk knew a shorter way over the hills. Riding fast under trees drooping with moss and over treacherous, slime-coated rocks, he arrived at the castle gates in two hours' time. He wasted no time in climbing to Tavia's cell at the top of the highest tower.\n\n""What did you think of him?"" asked the Empress.\n\n""He's a fool,"" replied Zuuk. ""But that's what we want for this sort of assignment.""\n\n30 Second Seed, 2920\nThurzo Fortress, Cyrodiil\n\nRijja screamed and screamed and screamed. Within her cell, her only audience was the giant gray stones, crusted with moss but still sturdy. The guards outside were deaf to her as they were deaf to all prisoners. The Emperor, miles away in the Imperial City, had likewise been deaf to her cries of innocence.\n\nShe screamed knowing well that no one would likely hear her ever again.\n\n31 Second Seed, 2920\nKavas Rim Pass, Cyrodiil\n\nIt had been days, weeks since Turala had seen another human face, Cyrodiil or Dunmer. As she trod the road, she thought to herself how strange it was that such an uninhabited place as Cyrodiil had become the Imperial Province, seat of an Empire. Even the Bosmer in Valenwood must have more populated forests than this Heartland wood.\n\nShe thought back. Was it a month ago, two, when she crossed the border from Morrowind into Cyrodiil? It had been much colder then, but other than that, she had no sense of time. The guards had been brusque, but as she was carrying no weaponry, they elected to let her through. Since then, she had seen a few caravans, even shared a meal with some adventurers camping for the night, but met no one who would give her a ride to a town.\n\nTurala stripped off her shawl and dragged it behind her. For a moment, she thought she heard someone behind her and spun around. No one was there. Just a bird perched on a branch making a sound like laughter.\n\nShe walked on, and then stopped. Something was happening. The child had been kicking in her belly for some time now, but this was a different kind of spasm. With a groan, she lurched over to the side of the path, collapsing into the grass. Her child was coming.\n\nShe lay on her back and pushed, but she could barely see with her tears of pain and frustration. How had it come to this? Giving birth in the wilderness, all by herself, to a child whose father was the Duke of Mournhold? Her scream of rage and agony shook the birds from the trees.\n\nThe bird that had been laughing at her earlier flew down to the road. She blinked, and the bird was gone and in its place, a naked Elf man stood, not as dark as a Dunmer, but not as pale as the Altmer. She knew at once it was an Ayleid, a Wild Elf. Turala screamed, but the man held her down. After a few minutes of struggle, she felt a release, and then fainted away.\n\nWhen she awoke, it was to the sound of a baby crying. The child had been cleaned and was lying by her side. Turala picked up her baby girl, and for the first time that year, felt tears of happiness stream down her face.\n\nShe whispered to the trees, ""Thank you"" and began walking with babe in her arms down the road to the west."

Ald Iuval and its sister city on the other side of the lake Ald Malak were strategically important fortresses. He had been expecting a move against them for some time.

""They'd be dragged down in the bogs if they then tried to circle around to Ald Marak from the north, so they must be planning to cross the straits here and take Ald Iuval. Then they'd proceed around the lake to the east and take Ald Marak from the south.""\n\n""They'll be vulnerable along the straits,"" said the captain. ""Provided we strike when they are more than halfway across and can't retreat back to the Heartland.""\n\n""Your intelligence has once again served us well,"" said Vivec, smiling to Cassyr. ""We will beat back the Imperial aggressors yet again.""\n\n3 Mid Year, 2920\nBethal Gray, Cyrodiil\n\n""Will you be returning back this way after your victory?"" asked Lord Bethal.\n\nPrince Juilek barely paid the man any attention. He was focused on the army packing its camp. It was a cool morning in the forest, but there were no clouds. All the makings of a hot afternoon march, particularly in such heavy armor.\n\n""If we return shortly, it will be because of defeat,"" said the Prince. He could see down in the meadow, the Potentate Versidue-Shaie paying his lordship's steward for the use of the village's food, wine, and whores. An army was an expensive thing, for certes.\n\n""My Prince,"" said Lord Bethal with concern. ""Is your army beginning a march due east? That will just lead you to the shores of Lake Coronati. You'll want to go south-east to get to the straits.""\n\n""You just make certain your merchants get their share of our gold,"" said the Prince with a grin. ""Let me worry about my army's direction.""\n\n16 Mid Year, 2920\nLake Coronati, Morrowind\n\nVivec stared across the blue expanse of the lake, seeing his reflection and the reflection of his army in the cool blue waters. What he did not see was the Imperial Army's reflection. They must have reached the straits by now, barring any mishaps in the forest. Tall feather-thin lake trees blocked much of his view of the straits, but an army, particularly one clan in slow-moving heavy armor, could not move invisibly or silently.\n\n""Let me see the map again,"" he called to his captain. ""Is there no other way they could approach?""\n\n""We have sentries posted in the swamps to the north in case they're fool enough to go there and get bogged down,"" said the captain. ""We would at least hear about it. But there is no other way across the lake except through the straits.""\n\nVivec looked down again at his reflection, which seemed to be distorting his image, mocking him. Then he looked back on the map.\n\n""Spy,"" said Vivec, calling Cassyr over. ""When you said the army had a horde of battlemages, what made you so certain they were battlemages?""\n\n""They were wearing gray robes with mystical insignia on them,"" explained Cassyr. ""I figured they were mages, and why else would such a vast number travel with the army? They couldn't have all been healers.""\n\n""You fool!"" roared Vivec. ""They're mystics schooled in the art of Alteration. They've cast a spell of water breathing on the entire army.""\n\nVivec ran to a new vantage point where he could see the north. Across the lake, though it was but a small shadow on the horizon, he could see gouts of flame from the assault on Ald Marak. Vivec bellowed with fury and his captain got to work at once redirecting the army to circle the lake and defend the castle.\n\n""Return to Dwynnen,"" said Vivec flatly to Cassyr before he rode off to join the battle. ""Your services are no longer needed nor wanted.""\n\nIt was already too late when the Morrowind army neared Ald Marak. It had been taken by the Imperial Army."

After Khunzar-ri defeated the giant Drol by consuming four-hundred-and-one moon-sugar pies, he met a demon.\n\nThe demon said, ""My brothers and I shall take this land and its treasures. Even the moons from the sky!"" Khunzar-ri objected, but the demon laughed. ""You cannot stop us, little cat-thing!""\n\nKhunzar-ri said, ""Not by myself, foul demon. I shall gather a Kra'Jun—a company of heroes—starting with the Altmer, Nurarion the Perfect, who communes among the buried roots of the Ayleid worms.""\n\nThese are the words and the words are true."
