msgid "A Summary\n\nBy Aicantar of Shimmerene, Sapiarch of Indoctrination\n\nThe kingdoms of the Daggerfall Covenant are inhabited by mongrel upstarts who have cruelly suppressed our Direnni cousins: the High Elves who are the rightful rulers of northwest Tamriel. They were largely complicit in the rise of the dangerous and genocidal fanatics known as the Alessian Order. They allow their pirates to prey on Aldmeri shipping. The Bretons are also so indiscriminate that they have accepted the bestial Orsimer as allies. (Orsimer! Can you imagine?) Though capable of mustering substantial brute force, there is no evidence that these degraded hybrids have the wisdom or learning to deal with the mystical disaster now threatening the Mundus. They must be disciplined and subdued as rapidly as possible, so the Dominion can get on with the business of saving the world … and protecting it in the future."

msgid "By Aicantar of Shimmerene, Sapiarch of Indoctrination\n\nOur cousins the Dark Elves have been duly punished for the betrayal of their ancestry: because they have embraced, and then attempted to emulate, the Daedra, a curse has disfigured their bodies and blasted their land. That lesson was apparently insufficient, for they have now left the boundaries of their cursed domain, and seek to infect the rest of the mainland with their heresies. The trio of wily demonspawn who rule them have duped the simple Nords and the slave-lizard Argonians into joining this mad escapade. \n\nTo allow the Ebonheart Pact to rule in Cyrodiil would be just as foolish as to leave the Empire to one or another of the tribes of Men. The Tribunal is ultimately an even greater danger to Nirn than the heedless and impetuous human nations. They must be driven back into their haunted corner of the continent with their power broken … forever."

Old Ehlnofey!\nYour loving visage haunts us yet.\nYour zephyr's kiss enthralls us still,\nThough only in heart's memory,\nAnd sorrow to the marrow deep\nInfuses every Aldmeri.\nWhen Magnus sinks and night-hour comes,\nAnd owl and spectre prowl and creep,\nWhen eyes can gaze at stars no more,\nThen fancy flits across the deep,\nWhence Aldmer came to eastern isles,\nEscaping doom oblivious,\nTo Auridon, hue-imbued\nWith spectrum vivid, various.\n\nFrom foam it rose before the ships;\nNine prows did plow the gleaming strand.\nTorinaan stepped from foremost craft,\nAnd claimed as Kinhold all the land\nFrom silver beach to green-clad hills,\nBegilded by the golden dawn.\nAuridon thus was the name\nBestowed upon that realm anon.\nThough wild it was, at once it gripped\nTorinaan's once remorseful heart.\nHe drew his blade, he drew his blood,\nAnd swore an oath to ne'er depart.\nThey disembarked upon the shore,\nBuilt Kinhouse, gardens, forge, and hive.\nThey tamed the meadows, beaches, fields,\nAnd made a home where Elves could thrive.\n\nThen howling from the hills in hate\nCame horrors horned, bedight with eyes.\nGheatus; Welwa; Ilyadi—\nAll sought the Aldmers' cruel demise.\nSome said they should take ship anew\nAnd seek a farther, safer shore.\nBut bold Torinaan valor steeled,\nAnd drawing on ancestral lore,\nHierogram with Varla Stones\nHe wove upon Auridon's loom,\nDrew power down from stars above,\nAnd drove fell monsters to their doom.\nHe harried them 'cross hills and heights,\nAll smiting them with magics dire,\nTill one by one they fell at last\nTo blast of lightning, ice, or fire.\n\nSo warded then by spells well-spun\nAuridon bloomed beneath the touch\nOf Altmer craft and husbandry,\nImagoform and sculpture.

msgid "Varieties of Faith in Tamriel: The High Elves\n\nBy Brother Mikhael Karkuxor of the Imperial College \n\nThe Eight\n\n(though few Altmer outside the Empire accept the limitation of Divines to eight):\n\nAuri-El (King of the Aldmer):\n\nThe Elven Akatosh is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of Anui-El, who, in turn, is the soul of Anu the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons. Most Altmeri and Bosmeri claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of Lorkhan in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Altmer, Altmora and Old Ehlnofey. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.\n\nMagnus (Magus):\n\nThe god of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the last second, though it cost him dearly. What is left of him on the world is felt and controlled by mortals as magic. One story says that, while the idea was thought up by Lorkhan, it was Magnus who created the schematics and diagrams needed to construct the mortal plane. He is sometimes represented by an astrolabe, a telescope, or, more commonly, a staff.\n\nTrinimac:\n\nStrong god of the early Aldmer, in some places more popular than Auri-El. He was a warrior spirit of the original Elven tribes that led armies against the Men. Boethiah is said to have assumed his shape (in some stories, he even eats Trinimac) so that he could convince a throng of Aldmer to listen to him, which led to their eventual Chimeri conversion. Trinimac vanishes from the mythic stage after this, to return as the dread Malacath (Altmeri propaganda portrays this as the dangers of Dunmeri influence).\n\nY'ffre (God of the Forest):\n\nWhile Auri-El Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, Y'ffre is revered as the spirit of ""the now."" According to the Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the Ehlnofey, or ""Earth Bones."" After these laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it.\n\nXarxes:\n\nXarxes is the god of ancestry and secret knowledge. He began as a scribe to Auri-El, and has kept track of all Aldmeri accomplishments, large and small, since the beginning of time. He created his wife, Oghma, from his favorite moments in history.\n\nMara (Goddess of Love):\n\nNearly universal goddess. Origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the ""Anuad,"" the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. For the Altmer, she is the wife of Auri-El.\n\nStendarr (God of Mercy):\n\nGod of compassion and righteous rule. In early Altmeri legends, Stendarr is the apologist of Men.\n\nSyrabane (Warlock's God):\n\nAn Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic, Syrabane aided Bendu Olo in the Fall of the Sload. Through judicious use of his magical ring, Syrabane saved many from the scourge of the Thrassian Plague. He is also called the Apprentices' God, for he is a favorite of the younger members of the Mages Guild.\n\n— Additional Deities with Significant Altmer Cults —\n\nPhynaster:\n\nHero-god of the Summerset Isles, who taught the Altmer how to naturally live another hundred years by using a shorter walking stride.\n\nLorkhan (The Missing God):\n\nThis Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri ""Lorkhan,"" or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo—much like his father Padomay had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. He and his metaphysical placement in the ""scheme of things"" is interpreted a variety of ways. To the High Elves, he is the most unholy of all higher powers, as he forever broke their connection to the spirit plane. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind."

msgid "By Telenger the Artificer\n\nAt the request of Her Majesty's advisor Nuulehtel I have compiled this brief accounting of the Maormer of Pyandonea, known commonly as Sea Elves. Read, now, and let the light of knowledge free you of your fear.\n\nTheir ancient history is well known across the Dominion, and not worth recounting in detail here. Suffice to say that the arch-mage known as ""King"" Orgnum has long led the outcasts of the shrouded isle. He uses foul spells, rituals and sacrifices to continually renew his youth and vigor.\n\nOther rumors you have heard are true, as well. The rituals of Orgnum allow the Maormer to control sea serpents. Some have mastered the art of riding the beasts among the waves, while larger and less docile beasts swim in support of their largest fleets.\n\nThe fleet that now threatens Auridon, we have learned, calls itself the Sea Viper. Recent events in the Three Banners War have driven the Vipers into the seas around Auridon and the mainland. The opportunistic Maormer now seek their own victories in the war between the alliances.\n\nThe First Auridon Marines, the Dominion Navy, and others now stand ready to halt the advance of the Maormer. If you see signs of the Vipers, report them at once to your Canonreeve or the nearest Dominion officer.\n\nEagles, know that the viper will not take our nest. Be wary, but have courage."

msgid "By Nuulehtel of Skywatch\n\nLoyal citizens of Auridon! I have the pleasure of being an advisor to Her Royal Majesty, Queen Ayrenn the First, Eagle Primarch of the Aldmeri Dominion, High Queen of the Summerset Isles, Overfriend of the Royal Camoran House of the Wood Elven people, and boon companion to the Mane of the Khajiit.\n\nAs Royal Advisor, I have penned this brief account of Queen Ayrenn's life and history. Read, that you might welcome our Queen into your hearts.\n\nHer Majesty spent her early days as many children do in the Isles. She trained in blades beside her father. She rode horses in the surf along our golden beaches. And she memorized history and sonnets beneath soft pink petals.\n\nOver twenty years ago, your forward-thinking King—His Royal Majesty, King Hidellith of Alinor, may he be ever honored in Aetherius—gathered with the royal family at the Crystal Tower in celebration of Her Majesty's passage into the Labyrinth. This time of intensive study had been required by all Summerset rulers in the past, and Her Majesty was to step into that period with arms wide. As the hour approached, however, the then-princess was found missing!\n\nWhile a long search was begun, in truth, Her Majesty had claimed her own destiny. Her Majesty had stolen away to the Isle of Balfiera to live with the Direnni at the Adamant Tower. The members of that clan trained her in the art of war. They turned her simple noble swordplay to lithe and seasoned blade-dancing. Her beachside rides became forced marches on horseback, and her singing of sonnets beneath the trees of her homeland gave way to the study of the arts most arcane.\n\nMuch has been made of our Queen's adventures in Tamriel by bards and common broadsheet scribes. Yes, it's true that she once rode a bear. That she hunted the frost trolls of Skyrim, delved into the depths of a Dwarven ruin, and crewed with a pirate captain of Cyrodiil. Her Majesty once flew upon an enormous kite on the winds of the Alik'r Desert, and danced with nereids in the Illessan Hills. These adventures were not the larks of a wanton, but instead a deliberate process. The tempering of a blade!\n\nAnd when His Majesty King Hidellith passed away, when it looked as though our remote isles would be left to flounder in the swell of history, Princess Ayrenn returned! Her Majesty plucked the crown from where it had fallen in the dust. She took up her father's sword and led us out into the world.\n\nLed us into the world to find new allies waiting just off our shores! The Queen's connections to the noble Wood Elves and fierce Khajiit enabled us to form the mighty Dominion that now stands astride our corner of Tamriel, poised to strike at the dark heart of Cyrodiil and ward off the depredations of the warmongering alliances of the north.\n\nThough she has her detractors and cowards defame her courage from behind a veil, Queen Ayrenn is the living, beating heart of the Dominion. Our fortune and prosperty depend upon her."

msgid "By High Incunabulist Valaste of the Mages Guild\n\nAs a member in high standing, I feel it necessary to explain and extirpate the notion that Kinlord Rilis the XII is somehow a founder of the Mages Guild. The common folk believe that the kinlord, in the days before his cruelty and sadism became well-known, brokered a deal that reigned in ""dangerous mages"" and somehow put binders in place to keep the commonalty safe. This is simply not the case. \n \nVanus Galerion, student of Iachesis, did indeed flout prevailing thought when it came to magical experimentation in large cities. He drew together numerous students and artificers to the city of Firsthold. For the first time, he sought to prove the benefit of spellcasters working in close proximity. Not for a mighty ritual, but for study, experimentation, and a sense of camaraderie.\n \nThis simple premise so terrified the people of Firsthold that they turned to their ruler, Kinlord Rilis the XII. Now known by many less polite titles, Rilis was first and foremost a political animal. He saw in ""Galerion's Folly,"" as it was known at the time, a chance to play the mages and common folk off against each other.\n \nThe much-speculated-upon ""Charter Conclave"" brought together Rilis, Iachesis, Galerion, and other notables from across the Isles and the Psijic Order. By common agreement, it is true, no records were kept of that meeting. But mark my words here, adept: Rilis allowed the meeting, allowed Galerion to do what he did, to further his own ends.\n \nIn retrospect, of course, the legacy of Artaeum is the proud heritage of the new Mages Guild. We now boldly gather together under the Guild banner, and will no doubt do so for many centuries to come. Just let it be remembered: Rilis the Twelfth was a dangerous mer. Even at the time of the Conclave, he trafficked with dark powers and made pacts with Daedra. \n \nThe proud order we all now serve is here despite his best intentions. Not because of them."

msgid "1st Morning Star: \nA new year, and a new start. Sirune agreed to be my betrothed last night! I'm the luckiest mer in Mathiisen. I've already made arrangements with Yondin to use the forge. I'm going to melt down my father's old blade and use it as the base for a Ring of Mara. Mathiisen steel is good enough for the troops, right? It will be good enough for my true heart.\n\n3rd Sun's Dawn: \nThe Heralds are shouting in every square across the island. There's a new Queen! And we're now part of some kind of Alliance—with the Wood Elves and the Khajiit, of all people. ""The Aldmeri Dominion,"" they're calling it. I couldn't be prouder, but father has done nothing but grumble. He says letting ""those kind of folk"" onto the island will be bad for business.\n\n10th Sun's Dawn: \nSirune and I sneaked out in the middle of the night and made for Skywatch. It was so exciting, bedding down by the side of the road. Like we're in the Fighters Guild! The handbills telling of the parade have been all over the island, and we decided we couldn't let something like this pass us by. I'll be thrice-cursed by the old mer, I know it. But damn him for a fool. Miss a chance to see the Queen, the Mane, and the Bosmer Treethanes? Not on your life.\n\n11th Sun's Dawn: \nIf today was any indication, Father was right. The parade was amazing, with Her Majesty leading a phalanx of Marines up the path to the gates. Then came the Treethanes, with their wily jungle rangers. Vinedusk, I think someone said? And then the Mane, with those braids! Amazing to see the Khajiiti warriors on display.\n\nMuch more pleasing than the furry sneak-thief I caught with his hand in my coin-purse. I tried to catch him before he made off, but he dove between some of those damned dock workers who were so obsessed with their frog races they didn't even look up. And then he was gone. Sirune said it was all right, that we'd just leave earlier than we'd planned. Damn it. Just hate to let her down.\n\n17th Sun's Dawn: \nDamn them all! Everything has been a mess since Sirune and I came back from Skywatch. Father was furious that we'd left, and when I told him how many coins that cat took … old bastard hasn't beaten me like that since I was learning the forge. \n\nThen, a few days ago, they pulled all of us into the forgemaster's office. Condalin had gotten word that, with the new alliance, tradesmer can start hiring some of ""those folk."" Tossing a certain number of jobs to ""them"" would net you extra coin from the Thalmor. \n\nAnd so he dropped father's contract! Been with the forge for decades, and now cat-men and cannibals are doing the job. All because of this damned alliance. Father's beside himself, about the steel more than anything. Says they won't know how to cure it right. Stars above, what's happening?\n\n2nd First Seed: \nMy life is ruined. I'm on the run, and everyone I knew and loved hates me. Damn the ""Dominion"" and our smiling Queen to boot!\n\nIt all started when that recruiter for the Battlereeve came to town. He was looking for volunteers for the Dominion military. When no one came forward, he said he'd been empowered to take conscripts. He tapped me and Sirune's brother. He also grabbed the twins, Taleril and Tanaril. Shoved us into a line with a gang of others and started us down the road.\n\nWe weren't a mile before Tanaril snapped. Went crazy, screaming about how he couldn't fight Dark Elves, that they use your body to hatch spiders in. He made a break for it, and a bunch of us used the chance to run as well.\n\nI'm holed up in a cave near Silsailen. My father is penniless. My bride-to-be will soon think me a traitor. The damned cats and runty Elves are taking over the island, and the military is putting children on the front lines. This isn't the homeland I grew up in!\n\n5th First Seed: \nI was reduced to trying to steal something for my evening meal, and—of course—I was caught. I slipped into Silsailen after dusk, the smell of some delicious whitefish wafting on the breeze. I hadn't eaten anything worthwhile since the morning the recruiter came into town, when I had that delicious spiced bread Sirune's mother made. \n\nI slipped into town and tracked the smell to the local inn. I was trying to figure out how to get into the kitchen when a big beefy hand fell on my shoulder. One of the Canonreeve's men. He knew exactly what I was doing, almost like he'd been watching me since I got into town. Now I'm sitting in a cell underneath the reeve's manse, waiting his justice. At least they let me keep the journal here.\n\nDamn you, Ayrenn! Damn you, Dominion!\n\n10th First Seed: \nMy old life is over. And my new life under the Veil has begun. It turns out the Canonreeve himself, an honorable man named Valano, has experienced his own doubts about his future under the Dominion. He used to be a good friend to the Queen, even, but worries now the years have changed her.\n\nValano is a member of a group called the Veiled Heritance. They're a group of freedom fighters, willing to do what has to be done. They're willing to make the hard choices, and stop the spread of foreign influence on our soil. \n\nI was brought up out of that cellar below Silsailen thinking I was going to do hard labor. Instead, I found a new family. Valano said he knew all about my problems, even knew that I'd been taken by a Dominion recruiter. Said that he was willing to help, and help me help myself.\n\nAnd I will."
