The Elves here found a way to bind the spirit of the jungle to the city's Welkynd Stones.\n\nThey must have thought themselves brilliant at the time. Bind the jungle to the city walls, then control the walls with magic. No more randomness. Pure order. \n\nBut the jungle went mad, trapped within the artificial walls. It took control of the city. Killed the inhabitants. Dragged the city beneath the ground. Then it slept. And we woke it up.\n\nThere may be a way to undo it. I'll need an Attunement Stone, used by the builders to create the binding spell. There should be one in the lower chamber, west of the central Welkynd Stone.\n\nWith the Attunement Stone, I have a chance to put things right here.\n\nBut first, three support stones must be attuned before the central stone can be used to remove the binding magic in the walls. I've marked the three here so I'll remember their location.\n\nWith those taken care of, it should be a simple matter of attuning the central Welkynd Stone, freeing the spirit of Root Sunder and ending this nightmare.\n\nDangerous task, but simple. I hope to be back at camp in time for wine with the others."

msgid "By Mirise Dres\n\nThe dead have so much to say if we have but the will, and the skill, to listen. My studies have already added much to my knowledge of necromancy and death magic. Why my fascination with the dead? I believe it goes back to my early childhood, when I would watch the sick and dying slaves in their pens, marveling at their pain and suffering. \n\nThere was one slave in particular, a Khajiit who went by the name of Abilar. Abilar was ancient when I was young. He was kind to the children of House Dres, serving as a teacher and guardian for the youngest among us. I was one of his students. He always had stories to tell and sweets to hand out. I found him to be … interesting. For a slave.\n\nOne day, Abilar did not show up to teach and watch over us. Instead, an Argonian whose name I don't recall came in his stead. When I asked about the Khajiit, the Argonian said that Abilar was ill and would not be returning. This intrigued me, as illness always did, and as soon as the opportunity arose I went in search of the ancient Khajiit.\n\nI found Abilar in the slave pens, lying on one of the hard platforms that served as beds for the household thralls. His eyes were closed, but he tossed and turned as though terrible dreams plagued him. I found a stool and sat beside Abilar, determined to watch and record every moment of his slide into death. My mother passed by and decided I was keeping a favored servant company until his end. I made no attempt to otherwise explain my actions.\n\nIt took Abilar three days to expire. He went in and out of consciousness along the way. Sometimes he was completely coherent and seemed genuinely touched that I was by his side. Other times he was delirious, speaking of places and people I knew nothing of. These periods of nonsense, I determined, were really glimpses of the border between life and death. Abilar's mind was bemused by the increasingly frequent trips his soul was making back and forth across the border. \n\nWhen the end finally approached, I moved closer and stared directly into Abilar's eyes. I saw the fear within them, and the acceptance. I saw the dawning understanding as his mind finally began to comprehend the mysteries and strangeness of the borderland. I asked him to tell me what he saw, what he knew, what he was experiencing. He started to form the words, started to reveal his secret to me. And then I watched as the light in his eyes dimmed and the breath rattled out of him. He died without so much as uttering a final word.\n\nThat was the day. That was when my affair with death and its mysteries began. I have devoted my life to discovering the secrets of death and dying. I have learned to harness the power of necromancy. But still a few vital secrets elude me. I shall never stop searching, even if it means a million slaves must die. After all, what's more important than knowledge? Abilar taught me that, and I shall always honor his lesson."

msgid "Scholars have studied the Ayleid ruins of Tamriel for generations, but they still remain shrouded in mystery. The treasures the Ayleids allegedly left behind have attracted both the intrepid and the foolish.  \n\nSome ruins are best left unexplored.\n\nThe Mages Guild has long sought to study a particular Ayleid site known according to old Ayleid records as Moravagarlis. Upon approaching its engraved arches, the first expedition wrote that they could detect a sense of wrongness about the very stones of the place.\n\nThose who remained at Moravagarlis for a significant time spoke of strange dreams and mad whispers that tugged at the edges of their sanity. Very little was discovered at the ruin as a result of the disturbances, and the dig was eventually abandoned.\n\nFurther expeditions became ill advised when the ruin was infested with Goblins in 2E 545. The ""Bonesnap"" tribe occupied Moravagarlis and the surrounding environs so thoroughly that dislodging them would have required a very difficult undertaking.\n\nNaturally, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Goblins experience any effects similar to those reported by the expedition team.

msgid "by Justinius Poluhnius\n\nIt is widely known among scholars that the Elder Scrolls entail a certain hazard in their very reading. The mechanism of the effects has, at present, been largely unknown—theories of hidden knowledge and divine retribution were the subject of idle speculation with little investigation.\n\nI, Justinius Poluhnius, have undertaken to thoroughly document the ailments inflicted by the Elder Scrolls on their readers, though a unified theory of how they manifest continues to elude me and remains a subject for future study.\n\nI have grouped the effects into four, finding that the avenue of experience depends largely upon the mind of the reader. If this is unclear, I hope that a proper dichotomy will lay it plain.\n\nGroup the First: The Naifs\n\nFor one who has received no training in the history or nature of the Elder Scrolls, the scroll itself is, effectively, inert. No prophecy can be scryed nor knowledge obtained. While the scroll will not impart learning to the uninformed, neither will it afflict them in any adverse fashion. Visually, the scroll will appear to be awash in odd lettering and symbols. Those who know their astronomy often claim to recognize constellations in the patterns and connections, but such conjecture is impossible to further investigate since the very nature of this study necessitates unlearned subjects.\n\nGroup the Second: The Unguarded Intellects\n\nIt is this second group that realizes the greatest danger from attempting to read the scrolls. These are subjects who have an understanding of the nature of the Elder Scrolls and possess sufficient knowledge to actually read what is inscribed there. They have not, however, developed adequate discipline to stave off the mind-shattering effect of having a glimpse of infinity. These unfortunate souls are struck immediately, irrevocably, and completely blind. Such is the price for overreaching one's faculties. It bears mentioning, though, that with the blindness also comes a fragment of that hidden knowledge—whether the future, the past, or the deep natures of being is dependent on the individual and their place in the greater spheres. But the knowledge does come.\n\nGroup the Third: Mediated Understanding\n\nAlone in Tamriel, it would appear that only the Cult of the Ancestor Moth has discovered the discipline to properly guard one's mind when reading the scrolls. Their novitiates must undergo the most rigorous mental cultivation, and they often spend a decade or more at the monastery before being allowed to read their first Elder Scroll. The monks say this is for the initiates' own protection, as they must have witnessed many Unguarded Intellects among their more eager ranks. With appropriate fortitude, these readers also receive blindness, though at a far lesser magnitude than the Unguarded. Their vision fogs slightly, but they retain shape, color, and enough acuity to continue to read mundane texts. The knowledge they gain from the scroll is also tempered somewhat—it requires stages of meditation and reflection to fully appreciate and express what one saw.\n\nGroup the Fourth: Illuminated Understanding\n\nBetween the previous group and this one exists a continuum that has, at present, only been traversed by the monks of the Ancestor Moth. With continued readings the monks become gradually more and more blind, but receive greater and more detailed knowledge. As they spend their waking hours pondering the revelations, they also receive a further degree of mental fortitude. There is, for every monk, a day of Penultimate Reading, when the only knowledge the Elder Scroll imparts is that the monk's next reading shall be his last.\n\nFor each monk the Penultimate Reading comes at a different and unknowable time—preliminary work has been done to predict the occurrence by charting the severity of an individual monk's blindness, but all who reach these later stages report that the increasing blindness seems to taper with increased readings. Some pose the notion that some other, unseen, sense is, in fact, continuing to diminish at this upper range, but I shall leave such postulations to philosophers.\n\nTo prepare for his Ultimate Reading, a monk typically withdraws to seclusion in order to reflect upon a lifetime of revelations and appoint his mind for reception of his last. Upon this final reading, he is forever blinded as surely as those Unguarded ones who raced to knowledge. The Illuminated one, though, has retained his understanding over a lifetime and typically possesses a more integral notion of what has been revealed to him.\n\nIt is hoped that this catalog will prove useful to those who wish to further our mortal understanding of the Elder Scrolls. The Moth priests remain aloof about these matters, taking the gradual debilitation that comes with reading as a point of pride. May this serve as a useful starting point for those hoping to take up such study.\n\nDictated to Anstius Metchim, 4th of Last Seed in the 126th year of the Second Era"

msgid "A Student's Journal\n\n14 First Seed\nAs I approach the end of my studies at the University, I am setting out to research the native wildlife in the surrounding lands. I have decided to focus mainly on the taxonomic order Skeevera, a much neglected area of study. It is also a far safer endeavor than more popular subjects such as giant insects or trolls. By avoiding such risks, I will be able to travel farther at less expense, eliminating the need for hired mercenaries.\n\n16 First Seed\nMy journey officially began today. As I made my way to the city walls, I took the opportunity to observe many of the rats that infest the sewers and trash heaps. Often overlooked in daily life, they really are quite a presence in the city. Living amongst and feeding on our waste, the common rat is quite at home in even the most inhospitable climates. Disease often follows it closely, making the rat one of the scourges of any major settlement.\n\n21 First Seed\nImmediately outside the city limits I began to see a wider variety of wildlife. The most common specimen of Skeevera found outside of a town is the rabbit. The rabbit commonly inhabits meadows and forests. It hides from its many predators in underground warrens. One may occasionally see a rabbit as a pet, but it is far more common to find one in a pie or a stew.\n\nToday is Hogithum, a fact I had forgotten until I almost stumbled upon two Dunmeri priests performing their annual ritual in the forest. I felt it wiser to avoid them, and quietly slipped away before I was noticed.\n\n7 Rain's Hand\nIt has been raining for two weeks now. Impossible to stay dry. I have been able to keep a fire burning only because of my rudimentary magic lessons at the University. The downpour has been too heavy to observe any wildlife. Even the wolves are hiding.\n\nAs interesting as the smaller creatures are, I long for something more … exciting. When the rain finally lets up I may choose to continue my studies elsewhere.\n\n12 Rain's Hand\nFinally, a break in the clouds!\n\n14 Rain's Hand\nI have located a wild skeever nest and have begun my observations. Like their rat cousins, skeevers often carry disease. However, the skeever is a major food source for many larger predators. Giant spiders will always have a few hanging in their webs. It is not uncommon to even find a skeever cooking over a camp fire.\n\nTomorrow I will attempt to capture a skeever for closer observation and dissection. One skeever should give me no trouble.\n\n15 Rain's Hand\nToday I attempted to catch one of the skeevers. The nest of creatures caught my scent before I got close enough to grab one. I got away but these bite wounds look like they might be getting infected. Perhaps traveling alone was not the wisest of decisions."

For most of my life and service as a healer, this has remained a theoretical issue. That is, until Ja-Reet.\n\nThough born in slavery, he's done well since the Pact and our emancipation. He even married a Dunmer—the daughter of the Narsis family who owned his parents. While I view such a union with personal distaste, it speaks well of his ability to interact in society despite his obvious disadvantage.\n\nMake no mistake, in Argonian society, he is disadvantaged. He's unable to read social clues, the subtle movements of muscle and tail that most of us take for granted. We occasionally have difficulty reading the emotions of other races. Ja-Reet has that problem even with fellow Argonians. He listens to spoken words, and is insensitive to their tone. Surely being born away from the Hist has deprived him of emotional intuition.\n\nHe brought his Elven wife with him to Percolating Mire. She's not welcomed by all, though she draws him out socially, which has been invaluable in trying to learn about how he thinks.\n\nPerhaps proximity to a thriving Hist tree will help Ja-Reet gain the intuition the rest of us take for granted."

Any Jarrin Root that has a dark purple coloration is far more effective, and is well worth the time and resources to find.\n\nOnce all ingredients are acquired, mix equal amounts of Jarrin Root, Nirnroot, lava ash, and water. Once your mixture is properly produced, crush it into pebble sized chunks and spread over the moon-sugar grass. Finally, wait for the grasses to begin thriving and producing highly potent moon-sugar.

Any browning or what would normally look to be a deceased plant is really a thriving moon-sugar grass sprout that will one day be vastly productive.\n\nMoon-sugar grasses that continue to grow in the vertical direction and emanate vibrant colors after the mudcrab treatment should be drowned in molten lava. While this may seem like it kills the plant immediately, it is actually creating an environment that encourages the effected moon-sugar grass to thrive after an extended period of time. Repeat this process until numerous moon-sugar grasses begin sprouting from the piles of cooled, hardened lava. \n\nUsing these methods in conjunction with recommended fertilization techniques will ensure thriving and productive moon-sugar grass crop.

It seemed too arcane, too brilliant for even a great alchemist to develop. Not that I couldn't likely produce something similar given enough time and resources, but my method, my language, would never be so … flawless. Even I can admit that.\n\nI found the answer. It was staring at me all this time in the middle of the shrine. Clavicus Vile. A maker of deals, granter of wishes, and not one I would ever wish to be indebted to.\n\nIt seems this ruin was stumbled upon once before in a very similar fashion to how we found it. It is likely they were the previous owners of Vassir-Didanat mine. It's a well-kept secret that the mine is not particularly rich. It produces barely enough ebony to make it worth working at all. And these mer that came before us grew desperate. They called out to Vile.\n\nA particular lack of wisdom and foresight it was that made them wish for an endless source of ebony. One must choose words carefully when dealing with Daedra. Although in this case it may have been better to make no deal at all. Regardless, some pact was made and the formula came to them. They must have successfully brewed it, for we found statues here dating back centuries. But suspiciously they kept very little records about their progress, or how they used it. \n\nIn truth, knowing this fact makes me somewhat uneasy. Sometimes I feel like I can hear the statue of Clavicus Vile whispering, or laughing softly to itself. But I made no deal with him. I am simply studying the result. He holds no sway over me."

The latest batch of curative starts the affliction, progresses the plague at a reasonable rate of speed, and then turns the afflicted into plague husks seventy percent of the time. Now we have a superior version of the plague and an effective way to dispense it.\n\nOf course, handing out curatives can be a slow process, especially in the larger towns and cities. Before we begin operations in Mournhold, we'll need a faster way to disperse the plague. But that's not my task at this moment. Besides, I'm sure that Alchemist Merdyndril is tackling this problem even as I write these notes.\n\nI should also record that I've perfected the husk scent. We can once again walk among the husks without fear of being attacked. I might even have an idea about a soap to remove the scent after we're finished.\n\nWe'll begin making larger batches of the curative immediately. In no time at all, we should be able to give everyone at the Serk and in the immediate vicinity a dosage of the curative. Don't worry, my mistress.

The afflicted turned into violent husks far more quickly than we had hoped for at this point in the process. Perhaps this particular mixture will be useful later, when we need a quick influx of undead soldiers, but for now this batch won't suffice.\n\nAn interesting side effect of this version of the curative concerns the level of aggressiveness demonstrated by the newly created husks. They turn immediately violent and consider everything that moves to be an enemy. Or food.\n\nThese husks also demonstrated a total disregard for the husk scent we apply when working in close proximity to them. They attacked our workers as soon as they saw them, indicating that the scent no longer masks us from husks created with this version of the curative.\n\nLet's increase the cooking time by one hour and decrease the amount of wolf bile by twenty-five percent.\n\n—Nostrum Breva"

I hope to answer many questions today.\n\nWere the Ayleids part of a strong contingent of Elves based at Variela? Or were they scouts coming from afar?

And if my admittedly limited knowledge of the language serves me, it's the classic Elven cosmogony:\n\nFirst there was Aurbis, the formless chaos from which the universe was formed. Then Lorkhan convinced the Aedra to sacrifice themselves to create the world, Mundus. Then finally, at the birth of the world, Magnus opened a hole to Aetherius, creating the sun and letting magic flow into Nirn.\n\nThis trinary comes up frequently in Razak texts. Chaos, earth, and magic. Perhaps it's central to his understanding of creation, not just of the world, but of constructs as well? \n\nI will have to ruminate on this later. For now I'll try my hand at picking the lock. Perhaps I'll have success with the mundane where magic failed."

The fortress rested high above the coast of Valenwood, a great stone monument and a bulwark against all enemies.\n\n""Because of its greatness, it became a wayrest for travelers, a vault for great treasures, and a vast library.

That is when the commander gathered the hundred original soldiers and convened a meeting. The fateful decision was made. One by one the soldiers bled on the stones and brought the great fortress crashing to the ground, destroying the enemy host beneath it.""\n\n* The text is unclear as to the nature of this horde, and the word used is unfamiliar to me, but resembles the word for ""army.""\n\nI have dedicated my life to finding the location of this great fortress.

It was simple to convince him that his own soul was tied to it and that its removal would mean immediate death.\n\nI do not have complete control of the illusions yet; when I tried to convince him the shed was made of stone instead of wood, he saw it as made of sweetmeats and I had to prevent him from attempting to eat it. The individual's own predispositions still have some undesired influence.\n\n17th Second Seed\nFinally! I solved two problems that have been stalling my work with one elegant solution. With the exact combination of domination spells I have created, I now have total control over the hallucinations (along with persistence) without the need for costly enchantments.\n\nThis is a timely find, as the subject recently indicated that removal of the amulet might be preferable to the current stages of the experiment. I can now begin looking for additional subjects.\n\n5th Mid Year\nThe three that inhabit my basement are convinced that they live in a palace. They have begun to take on the aspect of nobles, which is their own conceit—I have not attempted to alter their perceptions of themselves. This shared illusion has held for two weeks and shows no sign of breaking down under prolonged scrutiny, as the others had.\n\nI remain hesitant to subject myself to these illusions yet, though I am fairly confident I'd be able to extract myself. Testing has not revealed any of the distortions I'd hoped to observe in the nature of local reality. Perhaps more subjects are needed.\n\n10th Sun's Height\nAnother interesting development occurred today. I introduced the notion that a werewolf would rampage through the palace to just one of the subjects, out of range of the others. When I returned him and he awoke, it was not he who first spotted the werewolf at all, but another subject!\n\nEach seemed to perceive the beast. I shall have to test this further—is the illusion becoming its own reality, or have I accidentally connected them in some way? Could the false world bleed through? How exciting! \n\n23rd Sun's Height\nI am losing control. It is almost as if some outside force is interfering; I can feel a strange undercurrent in the spells I have woven, resistance in the minds of the subjects. They are becoming unintelligible and difficult to work with.\n\nOne sits in the corner, rocking back and forth and muttering prayers to Dibella, of all things. Another has injured herself horribly and will need to be removed. Thus far, I had not been concerned for the soundness of their minds. What could be causing this?\n\n2nd Last Seed\nTo my great surprise, everything in the basement was gone this morning—the simple furnishings, supplies, and, most upsettingly, the subjects. The basement walls, ceiling, and floor are now completely covered with a mural depicting the grand chamber of a palace.\n\nThe subjects are nowhere to be seen, and strangest of all are the set of paints and single brush found lying in the corner. Some trickery and tampering has clearly taken place. I shall have to investigate further."

They gave up everything they had to protect this very land.\n\nThe term ""hero"" depends on one's point of view. One man's hero, after all, can be another's villain, and another's king might be your tyrant. But everyone buried in Cath Bedraud fought and died for this land. Each of them, in their own way, has allowed us to live as we live today.\n\nAnd beneath the graves of these heroes lie the catacombs. The place where I believe the kings and queens and royalty of the past have been entombed. My studies of the surrounding countryside indicate that the catacombs exist. However, I haven't been able to find an entrance into these hidden tombs. Allow me to speculate on subjects where the existing records are incomplete at best.\n\nBefore our time, the greatest battles of the Alessians and Direnni took place in this very land. Thousands lost their lives in the great battles that occured here. After those conflicts, we saw the last Ayleid King pass away and the bloodline of the Direnni thin out.\n\nYet these Direnni had the most powerful magic at their command. Some say it was a type of magic that hasn't been seen before or since the Direnni. Magic that allowed them to bring down the tyranny of the Alessians and stop their army.\n\nI can only conclude that those who rest below Cath Bedraud are the heroes who fell in battle those long years ago. That the Direnni buried their own and then sealed the crypts so that their resting places would never be disturbed.\n\nI will continue to search for new evidence that supports this theory. And I will continue to explore Cath Bedraud in the hope of finding an entrance into these catacombs.\n\nI can only hope I don't disturb the Direnni magic that protects these tombs."

It was full of odd trees and murky water.  When I asked a local what this place was, he said ""This is the Hag Fens. A swamp, as anyone with eyes can plainly see."" I asked what I might find within, if I were to explore these Fens. The fellow responded rather tersely, ""Hags, you git. Why do you think we call it that?"" (I do enjoy speaking to the natives. It always adds an element of raw authenticity to my travels.)\n\nWhen pressed to explain about the hags, the local told me that they are some sort of witch. Exciting news! I like researching the different ways that magicka is employed across the land. I asked the taciturn fellow where I might find the ladies of the swamp and he made a rather rude noise. ""If ye're fool enough to go looking for the 'ladies,' as you call them, then head to the North Fens. Maybe they'll invite you to tea."" Locals are always leery of those that use magic, but I am sure the swamp witches would welcome some scholarly discussion.\n\n***\n\nI found the area of the Fens where the hags dwell. Unfortunately, I lost one boot, my walking stick, and one of my packs to the rather aggressive crocodiles that also call these fens home. But I can see some of the tree dwellings that I believe belong to the hags nearby. I have been observing from my hiding place behind a small shrub. My notes forthwith:\n\nHags have some strange deformity and rely on a walking staff to get around.\n\nThe hags appear rather unkempt and are obviously old.\n\nHags apparently use materials found in these Fens to craft attire that is rather rustic.\n\nThere are a group of younger, prettier witches who do not abide with the elderly hags.\n\nHags must send their menfolk off to work, as I have observed no male hags up to this point. Perhaps the males dwell in a separate camp? Note: Ask hags about their menfolk.\n\nOne of the hags nearest my observation post seems to be cooking something in a rather large cauldron. A bit of hot stew and a cup of tea would be welcome after my mishaps in the swampy fens. I shall approach slowly, so as not to startle the elderly lady. \n\n— Notation from Wyress Galliane: \n\nWe found a rather tattered Bosmer crawling out of the fens. He had barely survived an encounter with the hags and a crocodile or two. He was delirious and kept begging for tea and stew. We healed him and sent him on his way, although not before he attempted to proposition nearly every wyress in our camp. He left some of his notes, which we have preserved, though his complete lack of wit with regard to local creatures and customs, and his absurd observation skills, do not bode well for him surviving another journey."

The text was probably recorded by an Altmer, for it is written in Aldmeris.\n \n23. The Death of Lord Ihlendam\n \nIt happened in Second Planting (P.D. 1220) that Lord Ihlendam, on a journey in the Western Uplands, came to Nchuleft; and Protector Anchard and General Rkungthunch met him there, and Dalen-Zanchu also came to the meeting. They talked together long by themselves; but this only was known of their business, that they were to be friends of each other. They parted, and each went home to his own colony.\n \nBluthanch and her sons came to hear of this meeting, and saw in this secret meeting a treasonable plot against the Councils; and they often talked of this among themselves. When spring came, the Councils proclaimed, as usual, a Council Meet, in the halls of Bamz-Amschend. The people accordingly assembled, handfasted with ale and song, drinking bravely, and much and many things were talked over at the drink-table, and, among other things, were comparisons between different Dwemer, and at last among the Councilors themselves.\n \nOne said that Lord Ihlendam excelled his fellow Councilors by far, and in every way. At this Councilor Bluthanch was very angry, and said that she was in no way less than Lord Ihlendam, and that she was eager to prove it. Instantly both parties were so inflamed that they challenged each other to battle, and ran to their arms. But some citizens who were less drunk, and more understanding, came between them, and quieted them; and each went back to his colony, but nobody expected that they would ever meet in peace again together.\n \nBut then, in the fall, Lord Ihlendam received a message from Councilor Bluthanch, inviting him to a parley at Hendor-Stardumz. And all Ihlendam's kin and citizens strongly urged him not to come, fearing treachery, but Lord Ihlendam would not listen to counsel, not even to carrying with him his honor guard. And sadly, it came to pass that, while traveling to Hendor-Stardumz, in Chinzinch Pass, a host of foul creatures set upon Lord Ihlendam and killed him, and all of his party. And many citizens said thereafter that Bluthanch and her sons had conjured these beasts and set them upon Lord Ihlendam, but nothing was proven. Lord Ihlendam lies buried at a place called Leftunch."

msgid "After reviewing Kireth's notes on the prismatic emitter matrix set into the conduit chamber shows some remarkable strides in the understanding of Dwemer construction. Her scribbling may be childish and her language is, at best, imprecise, but her conclusions are no less exceptional despite her best efforts to the contrary.\n\nMy sister actually managed to generate and execute a working hypothesis that allowed her to not only determine how the Dwemer device was supposed to operate, but resulted in her repairing and utilzing the device to open a door that had been sealed—almost literally—forever.\n\nShe was able to fashion a replacement for a damaged emitter stone using scavenged parts from damaged Dwemer constructs and her own saliva. I won't touch the new component, and that's certainly not how I would have solved this predicament, but I am proud of my little sister."

msgid "The alignment of all of these crystally prism things seems to indicate that some shooty sparkly bits once propelled energy around the chamber. This is just a working theory, mind you, but I think I can repair this thing and make it do something. I just need some more sparkly bits and spinny parts from the metal spiders crawling around the ruin.\n\nThat would require fighting the icky spiders, however. I hate spiders."

msgid "Raynor,\n\nYour insistence on ignoring basic research continues to astonish me, dear brother. Look, you know what a Dragon priest is? Right? Centuries ago, the Nords worshiped Dragons as living gods. The most devout were elevated by the magic of the Dovah.\n\nThese shrines were everywhere. Now only a handful remain, most buried. Some may never be seen again. These ruins have a reputation for being draugr-haunted deathtraps, and they mostly are. But Taarengrav represents a unique opportunity to study this people's past.\n\nHere we've already seen evidence of how they lived as they built idols to their gods. We've found some of their children's stories and toys. Small carved Dragons, with writings in the Dragon tongue etched in their side. Little blocks with notches, to teach children the names of Dragons almost before they knew their parents' names\n\nSo stop complaining about how nice and warm the steam tunnels in Dwemer ruins are! You drive me mad.\n\n— Kireth"
