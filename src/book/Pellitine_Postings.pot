msgid "By Eutropia Laetonius\n\nKhajiit culture is often known for its flamboyance. It seems that whatever the Khajiit choose to do, they do it with gusto. But if I told you that the flair of the silk draped streets of Senchal couldn't hold a candle to a tiny village in the hills of Tenmar Forest, would you believe it? I do not exaggerate when I say that Black Heights is dripping with color, quite literally.\n\nMore than half the people of this town are devoted to the pursuit of art. Whether they be artists themselves or artisans who provide the highest quality supplies for the task. The pigments made in their so-called ""Colorworks"" are sought all over Tamriel for their vibrance in paint and dyes. These alone provide the town with enough wealth to allow such indulgence in the arts for so small a population.\n\nThe Khajiit of Black Heights have been refining their techniques for generations and their works are influenced by traditions carried on since the founding of the settlement. One of the oldest and most prominently displayed is a stone painting. Black Heights itself is nestled into the base of a mountain range and dotted with great stone boulders. Khajiit, particularly at a young age, are shown to paint with their paws upon the stones. Creating vast and colorful images out of hundreds of tiny paw prints. The greatest example of this is a fixture known as the Wall of Life, where every member of the village goes to add their leaves to the tree before they pass on. The scale of this bittersweet landmark left me speechless and it will do the same for you, if you hazard to venture out from the safety of Senchal and take in all the wonders Pellitine has to offer."

msgid "By Zargit the Studious\n\nThis one has studied the Topal Legionary Academy on and off, sometimes even asking those within (while they still lived) more about the history of the place. Because of the current status of the academy, Zargit does not wish to venture into the area yet. Perhaps some day. For now, though, this one will write what he knows of the place.\n\nOriginally a simple base camp for Imperials, the site was perfect for their needs at the time. The Imperials spent several years examining the terrain in the area at the behest of their Emperor, which, forgive this one, would most likely be listed in one of the books in the academy. This one's notes are confusing on that matter. They did not express what goal they had, but this one suspects it had something to do with taking over Khajiiti lands. Empires will be empires, after all.\n\nTime passed, as it does, and the Imperials started building a fortification here for reasons they would not tell Zargit, alas. For a generation or so, it was merely a safehold that allowed for Imperial movement within the area, but one of the leaders decided it would make sense to transition it into a training center for Imperials with potential. And so was born the Topal Legionary Academy.\n\nFor several generations, Topal Legionary Academy held a place of honor among the Imperial military families. Several sponsored the place, providing funds for its operation. In the early years, the location continued to serve as a barracks for those Imperials assigned to this area, but as sponsorship and demand for elite training increased, and other factions decided it was not as useful as it once was for troop movement, it transitioned fully into a school.\n\nThis tradition of training excellence continued until the Knahaten Flu, when the school's luck regarding sweeping illnesses ran out. (It withstood the Thrassian Plague, after all. The commandant noted to this one that they barricaded themselves inside for that illness, surviving it handily.) Unfortunately, whatever choices they made failed them in the face of the virulence of the flu, and the academy fell.\n\nNow local Khajiit claim that the place is haunted by the spirits of those who fell victim to the flu, though one or two of the more magically inclined state that something else that ""feels arcane or cursed"" haunts the location. They dare not approach, they state, to determine what this effect is, instead saying, ""Why would one ever want to visit a place that is now called the Forsaken Citadel? That is a fool's errand and a death wish.""\n\nDespite these warnings, this one wishes to venture into the glorious library and take away some of the books within for further study, but none will accompany him. Zargit finds it exasperating that he did not take better notes, too, and wishes to rectify this mistake. Maybe one day, yes?"

msgid "By Sulema, Initiate Scholar of the Pa'alatiin\n\nWith reverence for the experiences of those who came before us. May any sacrifices you made for the greater good be respected by those who follow.\n\nAs this one noted in her introduction to Anequina and Pellitine, we must work with a lot of unconscious biases of the non-Khajiit when it comes to building any historical work on Elsweyr using non-Khajiit sources. When the base language of a people differs from your native tongue, one misses nuance. This one would say the same for herself were she writing a history of, say, Murkmire, using translations of native Argonian lore. No language can be translated on a one-to-one basis given that words represent symbols of a thing, not the thing itself. And symbols often have tonal and emotional color: People fight for symbols; they die for symbols. They do not fight and die for a mere scrap of colored fabric but for what that fabric symbolizes to them.\n\nThat noted, this one shall start the history of the area now called Pellitine with the sixteen clans of the Khajiit and their ruler, the Moon-Emperor. During those days, the province now known as Elsweyr was open to all sixteen clans, and many roamed as they needed to perform the function they took on under the Moon-Emperor's auspices. Some functions required stable physical locations, such as ship-building yards and moon-sugar farming, so some clans formed permanent settlements to cater to such activities.\n\nThe name Pellitine comes from the clan of Moon-Priests named Pa'alatiin, in Ta'agra. The reasons for this name's rise to prominence over the years vary, but until the Thrassian Plague in 1E 2260, Pa'alatiin was simply a clan name, not the name of a geographical region, as the Moon-Priests lived among the people of all clans. The plague hit so hard, however, that clan structures crumbled in the south. Senchal, which had already started shifting in its social systems due to the influence of the Bretons and Imperials who came to its port, led the way in the aftermath of this illness. How? Simply by example and proximity.\n\nThe clans within the south at that time, seeking succor from the devastation of the plague, assembled on Senchal, the largest town at that time. Moon-Priests of Pa'alatiin also congregated in the town, seeking to provide what aid they could. Mix that with the social strata that had formed among those living in Senchal, and everything changed. Senchal's way of living imprinted itself on the Khajiit coming in from other areas, and when order slowly restored itself, these Khajiit returned to their lives changed.\n\nThis turning point, where the northern Khajiit adhered even more strongly to their clan ties, while the southern Khajiit started forming a more class-based society, also created a strong division between north and south that we still see today.\n\nOver time, the southern Khajiit rebuilt ruined structures, re-established trade routes with other peoples, and started thriving again. Senchal became the focal point of the south, both as a busy trading port and as the center of all customs and traditions that the southern Khajiit held dear. Additionally, Imperial ties strengthened to the point where the Potentate Versidue-Shaie took up residence in the Senchal Palace. So it came as an unpleasant surprise to some when Eshita, the ruler of Pellitine in 2E 309, married Keirgo of Anequina. Many in Senchal were aghast at the temerity of their civilized ruler marrying a barbarian of the north. The tribes of Anequina felt similarly betrayed. Yet, it happened, and the rulers worked to join their kingdoms together. But it was the Mane, Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, who quelled the unrest and instituted a power-sharing system between the tribes and the nobility based on the phases of the Moons.\n\nThen, in 2E 324, an assassin killed the Potentate while he was in residence at the Senchal Palace, scrawling the words ""Morag Tong"" in the Versidue-Shaie's own blood on the wall. Some claim that was an effort to mislead, while others believe firmly that the assassin was a member of the Morag Tong. Whatever the case, Imperial ties with the Khajiit became strained.\n\nTensions mounted until, in 2E 326, Khajiiti rebels slaughtered most of the royal dynasty. At that point, the two lands drew apart again, both writing statements of blame over the incident (see, for reference, the pamphlet entitled ""Northern Barbarian Betrayal!"" wherein an anonymous author claims the ""bloodthirsty"" Ne Quin-al clan brought about the demise of the royal line).\n\nDespite this state of matters with their northern neighbors, Pellitine flourished and Senchal grew until another sickness ravaged the land: The Knahaten Flu arrived in 2E 565.\n\nSo many died initially, especially in the Black Kiergo slums, that some tried to protect themselves by burning parts of Senchal to stave off the flu. As the fire grew, smoke killed many more in unaffected areas of the city. Many fled, only to die of starvation later as food stores ran low in the outer areas of Pellitine. Other unfortunate acts occurred, including the mysterious closure of the Topal Legionary Academy, and Southern Elsweyr stumbled for a time.\n\nNow, in these troubled days, with an Imperial legion stationed in Senchal to help with restoration and recovery efforts, and a sense of self-preservation overcoming the last of the clan-oriented practices, Southern Elsweyr suffers. Let us hope that the next phase of its story proves less troublesome."

Whenever you're butchering a Dragon, remember a pan or something to catch all the good bits.\n\nBlood\n\nAll that hot red stuff leaking out the Dragon's corpse. Goes without saying. Provided you left any in the beast before you killed it, slip a sturdy dagger between the scales on the throat and give a squeeze.

You'll want to drive a blade into the Dragon's groin and cut in the direction of its head until you hit the ribs. Don't cut too deep or you'll hit the stomach and spill acid everywhere. Reach in under the ribcage until you find a muscly tube and follow that until you reach a melon-sized organ. Give it a squeeze. If it's spongy, yank it out. If it's firm, that's the stomach, and you don't want to rupture it. The spongy organ should be full of pure bile. Ring it out like a dishrag until you've got nothing but pulp in your hands.\n\nRheum\n\nTechnically, you don't need to kill a Dragon to collect its rheum, but good luck scraping mucus off its face while its sleeping. Dragons secrete this from their eyes, nose, and mouth when they sleep. It tends to collect and dry in the corners of their eyes, edges of the nose, and crease of the mouth. Dried crust is fine, wet is better, but it'll probably be rare to get it that fresh.\n\nThere's a lot more I could add to this list, but they're too hard to gather in the field.\n\nGood hunting,\nDahfnar"

msgid "By Theyo Prevette\n\nIn my travels as a ghost hunter, I've encountered all manner of strange spirits and unusual entities, but I've never seen anything quite like the possession occasionally suffered by Khajiit. It starts as a sort of mental twitch, a tick of the tail, and an ear-worm the afflicted can't quite shake.\n\nAccording to Khajiit folklore, this is the first signs of becoming a Lost Cat. Without intervention, the Khajiit become more and more enthralled by an unheard tune. They begin to move along with the beat, performing unsettling motions they call the Bent Dance. Now I'd understand if you thought this madness was simply the result of an ailment or disease, but once the afflicted begins the Bent Dance proper the evidence of possession is unmistakable.\n\nAs the Khajiit continues to dance, their body begins a transformation. Their fur turns black and dark energies emanate from their body that even the uninitiated can see. Unlike most other possessions, the soul of the possessed isn't driven out to make room for the new spirit. Instead, the true occupant is twisted along with their form. Once the transformation is complete, they cease being Khajiit at all and become beings called ""dro-m'Athra."" These evil spirits go on to cause more harm until they are banished from Nirn.\n\nTo fight again this horrifying affliction, the Khajiit formed an order of wandering priests who use song to fight off the strange tune's influence. These are the Twilight Cantors. They claim the Dusk-Canticles they perform were a gift to the Khajiit from their ""god"" Azurah. I can't attest to the truth of that claim. By my estimation, the Daedric Princes bring nothing but horrors to our world. At any rate, I can say that when observing a Khajiit caught in the Bent Dance, the words of the Twilight Cantors seemed to soothe the afflicted and return them to some semblance of sense and self. I witnessed a cantor sing for three days to drive out the unnatural energies from a victim. Then, without so much as a moment's rest, she was off down the path in search of more darkness to banish.\n\nThese traveling mystics spend their entire lives on the road, ever vigilant in their fight against the dro-m'Athra. The Twilight Cantors have little in the way of possessions, carrying only the necessities and tools that assist them in their duties. They charge no fee for their work, instead living on the offerings Khajiit make in appreciation of their service. I noticed that Khajiit treat the cantors with a mixture of reverence and fear. It's a common belief that a cantor's visit is a sign of imminent misfortune and the folk who play host to them are quick to make offerings to guarantee the cantor's protection. Given that the stakes at risk involve the irrevocable corruption of their souls, you can imagine why.\n\nAs a professional ghost hunter, I have to respect the devotion it takes to risk your very soul every day for nothing more than a sense of justice. So, if you ever cross paths with one of these devoted exorcists, be courteous and pay them your respects with your coin pouch for their tireless and dangerous work."

I feel like they hamper understanding of what this itinerant Khajiit Moon-Priest tried to explain to me, but I needed to get these concepts down (albeit roughly) before my own mind confused me even more. As a result, any mistakes in this transcription are my own. I only wish I could give you the sense of timelessness that the Moon-Priest provided to me. But, perhaps that way opens a path to the likes of Sheogorath. Also, please note that the Moon-Priest refused to provide his name, stating that he was both a priest with knowledge and a neophyte with no knowledge, all at once.\n\n* * *\nBefore time and the tapestry, Pridehome existed. As an ideal, it has always existed. It will always exist. The Dragon God of Time, Alkosh, wove it into the tapestry and time, making it real for the rest of us with our limited perception of linear time.\n\nPridehome served as a home for the adepts who follow the teachings of the God of Time. A secluded place. A place where they prepared for the Doom to Come, a time when the Dragons return and bring unbalance to the world.\n\nChampion Ja'darri heard the call of Alkosh and crafted Pridehome, making it real for the rest of us. Yes, she fought the Black Beast. Yes, she died even as she succeeded. Yet she succeeded only for a time, in your mind. But, yes, she has always existed and succeeded. She will always exist.\n\nThe ideal and place of Pridehome has always existed. As has the Pride of Alkosh, of which Ja'darri was the first, provided you hold with the concept of events unfolding one after the other instead of all at once.\n\nCan you imagine, you who are bound to the tapestry and linear time, knowing that Ja'darri both succeeded and failed at the same time? Just as the one called Abnur Tharn succeeded and failed at the same time? And in the same moment, outside of linear time? Perhaps you cannot. Perhaps that asks too much.\n\nMore champions heeded the call after Ja'darri, in linear time. More came. Clan Mothers came and went as well. Until, as time passed, in the common parlance, one named Ra'khajin arrived. He both succeeded and failed to become a champion, just as Ja'darri before him. How, you ask, is this possible?

msgid "By Ziri, Chronicler of the Senchal City Council\n\nThe Knahaten Flu devastated Pellitine, what the Imperials refer to as Southern Elsweyr. So many Khajiit fell to this terrible disease, including Z'har Tasluz, governor of Senchal and vassal to the royal family of Anequina, as well as most of the nobles of the Pellitine bloodline. For seventeen years, Senchal was cut off from the rest of Tamriel and literally left to its own devices. And those devices, they were not altruistic.\n\nPirates, smugglers, marauders, and thieves rose to positions of power and influence in order to fill the vacuum left by the death of our legitimate leaders. It was a dark time for Senchal and the surrounding countryside, a time of death, destruction, fire, and oppression. We had to become stronger, wilder, to survive, which was ironic considering we always thought of ourselves as the more refined and cultured half of Elsweyr.\n\nFinally, help arrived in the form of an Imperial Legion. The Thirteenth Legion, to be exact. General Renmus and his legionaries were sent by Emperor Aquilarious shortly after he took the Ruby Throne. It was a noble gesture, but once the emperor disappeared and the empire collapsed, the general and his soldiers were on their own. But they never abandoned their post. They brought back a semblance of order and made Senchal safer than it had been in years. Until the Dragons returned.\n\nGeneral Renmus returned law to our lawless land. He refuses to become a military dictator or oppress our people. Even though we originally met the Imperials with hostility and distrust, we grew to respect them. We even gave them a new name—the Shields of Senchal, for that is what they quickly became. Under their protection, Senchal began to rebuild and return to something resembling the days of old. Criminal elements were driven back into the shadows and a modicum of law was reestablished. The general even helped us form a governing council to better administrate the needs of the city.\n\nThey may not be Khajiit, but their hearts are with Senchal and its people. They are our shields, and we appreciate everything they have done and continue to do for us. This one just wishes she believed they can actually save us from the rage of Dragons."

msgid "by Amun-dro, the Silent Priest\n\nHis feet touched sand and he knew he had died. He could not remember how it happened, but found he did not care either. It had been a life well-lived, whether he believed so or not, and all had been exactly as it was meant to be.\n\nHe could not remember his name. He was still Khajiit, that much he knew. He felt his claws, and his whiskers, and his fur. He smelled salt and sugar.\n\nHe opened his eyes when he remembered having them, looking out at an endless sea. There were old things there, above and below. He saw he was not alone. Other spirits slowly drifted away from the shore. He thought better of calling out to them. The sand was warm between his toes and the sky was painted dusk. \n\nHe turned to look upon the island. There was a house there, one of glass and moonlight and truth. The smell of sugar was stronger in that direction, so he walked that way.\n\nThe sand shifted under his feet, never quite giving him sure-footing. When he tried to step up to what seemed to be stone, it crumbled beneath his foot. Still he walked, and stumbled, and climbed. He reached a stair and stepped on to it, but it was made of transparent glass. Even though it was sturdier than the sand, he found it difficult to trust each step. Still he walked, and stumbled, and climbed. He reached the door to the house of light, but he could not open it. He looked up to the sky and the Lattice. He tried to remember the Motions, the secrets a Mother had taught him, but it was hard, and the Lattice kept shaking. Still he walked, and stumbled, and climbed.\n\nThe gates to the house opened and he walked inside. He knew She was there. He knew he would be struck blind if he looked upon Her, but he could not help it. He looked upon Azurah, She Who Sits at the Precipice, and he saw Her. He was not blinded. She was lithe and tall, reclining on a cloudy bed of stars. She wore nothing, yet he could only see one of her faces. There her eyes shined like the Moons.\n\n""My child,"" Azurah said, and he remembered his name. ""You've come home.""\n\n""I have been here before,"" said the Khajiit.\n\n""You have walked many paths,"" Azurah replied with a purr. A path of roses formed before his feet, leading up to her. ""All for me.""\n\nHe stepped onto the path of roses. Thorns cut his feet. The closer he got to Azurah, the farther away she appeared to be. She rose higher and higher until he was climbing a wall of roses and his fur was matted with blood. Each time he reached the top of the wall and pulled himself over, he was standing at the start of the path again. Still he walked, and stumbled, and climbed.\n\nHe was in Her cupped hands then. Her face was the sky and Her eyes the Bright Moons. He lived there in sugary bliss for many lifetimes before his feet touched sand again. \n\nNow he was on the other side of the island. It was dark and cold. It was so dark that he could only see the water when it moved. If there were any spirits there, they were one with the darkness. His tail twitched.\n\nHe turned and saw Azurah once again, smaller now to stand alongside him. She carried a Moon-Staff and wore a silken dress of purple and gold. She appeared not unlike a mortal. Beautiful and weary. She looked with him out into the darkness.\n\nThe Khajiit saw the sadness in Azurah's eyes. She had given him so much, he knew, and he had given so little in return. ""I am ready to walk again,"" he said at last. ""What would you have me do?""\n\n""I must send you into the dark, little one."" There were tears in Her eyes, but She did not let them fall. ""You must make a path for me.""\n\nHe looked back over the dark water, noticing just how much it moved. ""I will do anything you ask, Mother."" \n\nAzurah smiled at that, and his heart was glad. She plucked the Moon from atop her staff and stepped toward him.\n\n""I give to you my Moon,"" Azurah said, and She put Her lips to his forehead and kissed him. And as he took the Moon, it became a weapon.\n\nThe Khajiit held the blade before him. It shined with Moonlight and he no longer feared the dark. \n\nAnd Azurah told him: ""Bring my children back."""

msgid "Yeah, so, this is my journal. I'm Yamighu of Peryite's Chosen. Hopefully this book doesn't become privy paper like my last journal did. I'll dust these pages with some itching powder just in case. I can stand the itch. Most others can't—especially in their tender regions.\n\nTraveling to find a new location for my group's worship of Peryite has been hard for an Orc like me. I gave up my home for Peryite, but that's a long story that requires more ungorth than Elsweyr has. Still looking for a new home. Heard about this place called Black Kiergo and decided I should visit one day. That day is now.\n\nBlack Kiergo is a vast, underground slum that stretches beneath the streets of Senchal. Supposedly, secrets paths lead into Black Kiergo, so I'll need to find one of these paths. In addition to the poor and destitute, all sorts of vile and corrupt business takes place in the depths of Black Kiergo, which speaks to the glory of Peryite almost perfectly! I can't wait to see the place for myself.\n\nDay One\n\nSenchal looks run down. Fire-scarred as well as flu-scarred, I hear. So many refugees. Bet they need work. Got to prove themselves worthy to eat. Perhaps this is a sign. I have plenty of work to hand out, thanks to Peryite. Not enough food here. And the Dragons, well, they just add to the whole ambiance. I like it.\n\nFound out Black Kiergo got flamed first during both the Thrassian Plague and the Knahaten Flu. Weak-minded fools. Putting flame to such things only gets you dead of breathing smoke. Promising for my purposes, I suppose.\n\nDay Two\n\nHeard some tales about this Rajhin thief fellow growing up in Black Kiergo. Also learned more about how people fear Black Kiergo if they don't live in it. It's the slums of this town. This place gets better and better. Time to head into this welcome darkness.\n\nTaking a moment to write what I've seen since this morning. And smelled. For a place that serves as the home of outlaws and scoundrels, Black Kiergo sure is spacious. I bet we could take over a corner and no one would even notice. Folk down here are a suspicious lot, but I like that about them. Trusting folk make my tusks itch. The smells, though. Just what you'd expect of a slum. I note them only because it reminds me of my time hiding out in Riften. Good times.\n\nCat-land history mentions a fellow named Keirgo who married someone and founded the nation. Got to make sure I spell that name right. Even though it sounds the same, it isn't spelled the same as the underground slums. This place and that fellow have no real connection. I found this out when I asked one of the locals about it and he put a knife to my throat. Nice to see they have pride in their heritage, but I did need to give the guy a bloody nose and a broken knife for my troubles. Praise Peryite!\n\nThese people need better blades, though. It shouldn't have broken so easily.\n\nDay Three\n\nGot a bit celebratory down in the arena area of Black Kiergo. Lots of strong drinks. Some of it was Elven backwash, but who cares after your twentieth or so flagon? And, yeah, the slums have an arena. More of a fighting pit, actually. A place for nobles to spend gold and bet on how much blood the poor people can spill. Kind of exciting, though. Heard some whispers about a cult that worships Dragons. Competition? I'll need to keep my ears open. Peryite's more than a Dragon, of course, but I wasn't expecting to have to compete for followers. Tusk it all, anyway!\n\nDay Four\n\nFound a nice place to set up shop. Need to send Reetza off to collect the rest of the group and bring them back here. She's been busy in Senchal proper, talking to the crowds and spreading the word of Peryite. We're striving for a mix of fun and work. Balance, you know. Peryite's not all pestilence and poverty, after all. Any illness he sends your way? Live through it and prove yourself strong, that's what I say! Too bad about some of those I sent to their graves for disagreeing with me. Seeing as how I'm still here and they aren't, I think my Prince agrees with me.\n\nI'm thinking of entering the arena while I'm waiting for the rest of the group to arrive. Haven't had a good fight in a long time, and maybe I can earn some gold along the way. Peryite knows we could use the funds! Wish me luck in Black Kiergo!"

We do not jail free-thinkers as Dark Elves do. We do not decry salads as a blasphemy like the stubby acorn-worshipers of Valenwood. We do not pledge our souls only to eight dusty myths like the furless litters of long-dead Alessia. To be a Khajiit is to be free—free of cruel dogma, and free of bitter self-denial. Riddle'Thar does not kneel and mumble, it dances and sings! Ours is a faith rooted in joy, and faithful indulgence, and grinning charity. Alas, this strength often slides into shrugging disregard. We let our claws slip from the truth and wonder if ""truth"" even matters. Worship and transaction fall into eclipse. Well-earned relaxation gives way to a kitten's indolence. Our spirits grow poor. And a spirit so afflicted makes itself the perfect prey for the dro-m'Athra.\n\nAmun-dro's catalogue of spirits preys on the worst aspects of our carefree natures. Take the inclusion of Mafala, the Eight-Clawed. Were the bloody horrors of the Sinner Suicides not proof enough of her dark nature? Consider also the Tide-King, Hermorah. This document would have us believe that Azurah walks the dampened halls of his dark library as friend. If our distant mother does this, should we not do the same? No! For Khajiit who call on Hermorah's counsel risk a fate worse than death. Mumbles from the sea will tear a mind asunder as surely as the most potent skooma. His briny ""truths"" shred our sense of reality and set us adrift—far from ja-Kha'jay.\n\nWe must also consider who this catalog of spirits excludes. These books offer the rosiest descriptions of malevolent beings, but what of loving Mara and noble S'rendarr? This ancient zealot, Amun-dro, fails even to mention their names. And why? Because his aged theology offers no refuge for simple virtues like charity, humility, and love. Our beloved Rid-Thar-ri'Datta offered us more than Clan Mother tales—he offered us grace. In a world so crowded by great spirits and grand cosmic plans, where does the simple Khajiit rest his weary paws?  The Two-Moons Dance speaks plainly. It has no need for ancient conflicts—only simple precepts that lead to a life well-lived. In the end, a joyful life is the greatest gift of the Riddle'Thar."

msgid "Thava-ko sings now a song of Riddle'Thar. Let its sweetest truth rest upon Thava-ko's tongue.\n\nNow Thava-ko thinks on the Path.\n\nThe ancient Amun-dro's catalog of spirits offers us little more than vagaries when it comes to moral action. This comes as no surprise. In truth, the First Mane's epiphany had little to do with the aged stories of kingdoms past. Before Riddle'Thar, priests and adepts busied themselves deciphering the arcane ramblings of ancient prophets—gleaning precious little from vast and crumbling archives. How like pearl divers they were! Prying open countless ugly shells in the vain hope of finding some tiny treasure within.\n\nYou must ask yourselves, what profits a Khajiit to puzzle over such a text? You who wield the scythe. You who drive the wagons. You who work the forge. Do these tales of cosmic import bring you solace in your darkest moments? When you turn to thievery to feed a sick child, or watch your father whip your brother for a sin you committed, or struggle under the heel of a foreign oppressor, what guidance can you find in these old myths? They speak of ""paths"" and ""laws,"" but Amun-dro's path is little more than this: obedience. Slavish devotion to our distant mother, Azurah. Deference and respect for darkest spirits of Oblivion. Tangled, contradictory virtues that threaten to send one tumbling whisker-first into the gaping maw of Lorkhaj. Amun-dro's world is a world of woe—a swirling gyre of fate and darkness where the Khajiit have no voice beyond hymns of worship or screams of terror.\n\nWhat of Llesw'er? What of joy, and good food, and honest labor? Riddle'Thar, as described by our blessed First Man, offers a true path. Better yet, it is a path you already know. The Two-Moons Dance whirls and reels in your heart, just as it always has since the moment of your birth. You needn't look to the distant past. Look to the now, and the road ahead—tread clean by the paws of faithful pilgrims. Nirni's bounty and the Sands of paradise are your birthright, Moon-child. Cast aside Amun-dro's morbid tales and live a joyful life worthy of the Sugar God!"

msgid "Taken from the sacred annals of prophesied Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, First Mane of the Epiphany\n\nLo, many proud Khajiit bring their braided locks to me in hopes of affixing their dreams to my own. They prostrate themselves before me and kiss my weathered soles, begging for a glimpse of ja-Kha'jay. I sit then upon my upraised throne, draped in the plaited burdens of countless chiefs, and sigh. For the epiphany of Riddle'Thar rests not within the Mane-made-mighty—not even in the sacred halls of the Temple of Two-Moons Dance. The truth of Riddle'Thar lies in the heart of true Khajiit. In the claws, the whiskers, and the soul. Think now on Jone and Jode. Think now on their wax and wane. Khajiit do not deliberate in the womb. We do not struggle for form and purpose. The Dance decides. And in that fated moment of birth, we learn what our soul already knows. We fall into the cadence and the step. The Moons' virtues and obligations are inherent, just as our furstock is inherent. The truth of Riddle'Thar grows like sugarcane in the soul—sweet, vibrant, and eager for the harvesting. We do not make the cane grow. We do not coax it into fullness. It does that of its own accord. You need only take up the scythe in the proper season and reap its ample blessings.\n\nThe pursuit of Riddle'Thar's mysteries is also the pursuit of joy. Of fulfillment. I speak now the truth that, in your heart, you already know. Embrace that wisdom, pay heed to the dictates of the soul, make way for the peace and order Riddle'Thar provides, and you shall find joy in abundance.\n\nFirst, a true cat must be curious. How often the furless outsiders fall prey to deception and mirage! Lorkhaj's inventions do not lurk at the corners of our sight. They lounge in plain view—so common and unassuming that we accept them as truth with a kitten's simplicity. One must always listen longer and gaze deeper. Do not yield at your first thought. Inquire. Lift stones both great and small. For gifts of persistence are many indeed.\n\nNext, a true cat must be clever. Providence granted us the gifts of swift claws, fleet paws, and graceful strength. But the dangers that prowl upon Nirni's back too often withstand the well-timed strike. When trapped in life's cruel maze, you must resist the call to simple solutions. Do not resort to artless scheming. For every trouble there are countless strategies—and the greatest of those strategies rest within the mind. Fight without fighting. Speak without speaking. Yield without yielding. Do this, and you shall find that the greatest joys are those that hide on the far side of a jest.\n\nThird, a true cat must treat themselves with kindness. Too often, leaders of the book and stole preach charity at one's own expense. Theirs is a wheezing virtue, hidden beneath a mournful shroud. How many coins can a starved almsgiver carry? Too few. I tell you, the fruit of charity grows from joyful, vigorous branches. If all give and none take, how wretched our kingdoms would become! Take the rest your labors earn. Taste the sugar that falls from above. Drink the wine that flows from Nirni's great bounty. For in walking pleasure's road, we blaze a trail for the downtrodden to follow.\n\nNext, a true cat must be pious. The Two-Moons Dance offers a path to ja-Khaj'ay, but without Llesw'er's guides, even the cleverest Khajiit can drift toward the Dark. Mighty Alkosh, Blessed Khenarthi, Noble S'rendarr, Loving Mara, Clever Baan Dar, and most importantly, Jone and Jode reign beyond the stars, alight with kindness, wisdom, and virtuous cunning. The enlightenment of Riddle'Thar is a lens of clarity through which true cats can now view these divine ancestors. Heed their counsel, observe their laws, and by the grace of Riddle'Thar, you shall never fall prey to the snares of Namiira.\n\nFinally, a true cat must be wary. Of all the races who dwell upon Nirni's back, we Khajiit risk the most. Our history dwarfs that of men. We sowed our crops here before the coming of the Elves. Our souls stretch back beyond the counting of the years and the certainty of each sun's rising. That makes us both wise and dangerous. The hateful eyes of Lorkhaj stay fixed upon us always. Namiira's darkness swirls amid our dreams and doubts. All the evils of Oblivion rake their claws and gnash their fangs against the Lattice, seeking to take our old souls as a prize. Be cautious. Move swiftly. Hide your hearts away in the thick jungles of the self and think often of their great worth. For if you fail to hear the beating of your own heart, the beat of Lorkhaj's will take its place forevermore.\n\nRiddle'Thar is all of these virtues, Moon-child. The great well of Khajiiti spirit from which we all drink. Know that its truth dances beyond just the Mane, beyond the Temples, beyond the plains and jungles of our beloved homeland. Look to the Moons. When Jone and Jode dance above, your soul dances with them."

msgid "An Investigation into the Order of the New Moon\nBy Sulema, Initiate Scholar of the Pa'alatiin\n\nThe appearance of recruiters for the Order of the New Moon has caused a few in Senchal to look upon this emergent religion with either contempt or concern, depending on their station and perspective. This one decided to take a different approach. Does the Order of the New Moon represent a new cult born out of the chaos of the rage of Dragons, or is it an ancient religion resurfacing from the depths of history?\n\nThis one was able to speak to a recruiter, who was more than happy to describe in vivid detail the creeds and tenets of their beliefs. While these Khajiit acknowledge Jone and Jode, they believe that a New Moon will soon rise that will outshine them both. They believe that the path to salvation and power lies in this New Moon and not in the worship of gods that remain silent and distant despite the desperate prayers of the faithful. \n\nThe Order of the New Moon definitely attempts to appeal to those suffering under the current troubles that have been compounded by the appearance of the Dragons. For this reason, they have attracted mostly the poor and the homeless to their ranks. This one observes that the cult uses false promises and fear as a recruitment tactic. They also seem intent on appeasing the Dragons rather than in combating them. Very curious.\n\nThis one has found references to a similar group that was active in the ancient past. Which brings us back to the original question: Is the Order of the New Moon a recently organized cult or does it represent the resurgence of an ancient religion that was biding its time before making a return? This one will need to engage in more research and investigation to make that determination."

msgid "By Axulsha of Black Marsh\n\nTo better prepare for possible threats to the Hist, I tasked myself with studying Dragons in Southern Elsweyr. Herein are my observations on the appearance, diet, daily habits, and combat techniques of two Dragons I observed. For simplicity, I have classified them by color.\n\nThe Red Dragon\nMy understanding, after talking with those in Senchal, is that the Dragons currently operating in Elsweyr have a hierarchy of sorts, which is unusual if you consider some of the lore I've read on the subject. As such, the red Dragon I observed for a few days as it hunted in Southern Elsweyr seemed remarkable in that it was not overtly part of a hierarchy at all. Aside from this broad observation, my compiled and clarified notes on this creature follow.\n\nAppearance\nCovered in crimson, overlapping scales, the red Dragon possessed a sleek profile. It lacked ostentatious horns, which surprised me. Perhaps my expectations led me to believe that all Dragons had a jagged profile with horns that would gore prey, much like a bull's horns. Its yellow eyes had slitted pupils.\n\nDiet\nThe primary diet of the red Dragon appears to be meat. I did not see it eat plants at any point, so it most definitely be classified as a carnivorous creature. As an apex predator, this makes sense. As for preferred food? I didn't notice any particular preference, though at times the Dragon acted as if it hunted intelligent prey for the challenge they presented. It especially savored a two-person hunting crew that gave it a brief challenge. It toyed with them until one made a lucky strike with an arrow. It ended the confrontation quickly after this.\n\nDaily Habits\nAside from eating, I did not witness a range of cyclical habits pertaining to this Dragon. I cannot say for certain that they need sleep, which makes them even more dangerous if this proves to be the case. Given my sample size, though, I may have stumbled across an insomniac who has no preference for time of day and activity. Even its eating habits were somewhat random, though perhaps they were based on how much it had last eaten and its digestive process.\n\nCombat\nWithout large horns, the Dragon relied on claws, shouts, wings, and tail against intelligent prey. Against animals, it simply grabbed what it wanted and landed to eat it. This Dragon also utilized flame-based attacks and could summon creatures of flame, such as flame atronachs. Methods for countering fire must be developed for dealing with this creature.\n\nThe Black Dragon\nAs with the red Dragon I observed, the black Dragon (though some might call it ""dark gray"") also seemed to observe no hierarchical societal structure in regards to other Dragons. At least, none that I could see.\n\nAppearance\nThe black scales on this Dragon also overlapped, and its head structure featured downward curving horns. Its tail was covered in spikes at the end, making it particularly effective as a melee weapon. Its orange-gold eyes have slitted pupils.\n\nDiet\nThis Dragon preferred meat to anything else, though I did see it graze on some leaves at one point. Perhaps it requires plants to add valuable nutrients to its system? When hungry, it grabbed the animal it wanted and flew a short distance to eat it in relative safety. As for hunting intelligent beings, its tactics tended more toward stealthy hunting, then ambushing them to keep resistance to a minimum. I can only guess as to why it chose ambush tactics. Perhaps it was wounded in the past when stalking armed hunting parties? Or maybe it finds joy in stealth and surprise.\n\nDaily Habits\nThe black Dragon preferred nocturnal activity, taking shelter during the day in a location I found only through careful observation. Upon sunset, it began hunting for food, returning with captured prey to its shelter. After that, it would take to the skies and fly, returning at dawn to what I came to think of as its nest or lair. I believe that it must have sensed my presence at one point, for it did not return the next morning. A quick examination of the remains of its recent meals demonstrated the Dragon to be a fastidious eater. It was careful to remove armor and eat around natural protection to get at the soft meat inside.\n\nCombat\nAs noted, the black Dragon I observed preferred to hunt and ambush its prey, surprising and making quick work of its targets. It used a combination of tail swipes, wing buffets, shouts, and claws on those it attacked, preferring the snatch-and-grab tactic against animals. Since this black Dragon called lightning and storm atronachs to aid it against multiple targets, I'm tempted to call it a storm Dragon."

Instead she wept, the light of the Lattice was reflected in her tears.\n\nFadomai whispered to Azurah three secrets and more. She told her daughter many things, stories of love and war and dreams undreamt. And Azurah wept more to hear these things, so much that moonlight shined in the darkness.\n\nAnd Fadomai told Azurah the names of all gates and thresholds, and the names of all the spirits, and the names of all the Khajiit that would ever live. And Azurah wept more to hear how difficult their paths would be, so much that the light of her tears became one with the Lattice.\n\nAnd Fadomai told stories of her children and her favorite aspects of each of them. When she reached Azurah, she smiled and told her favored daughter she could not decide. And Fadomai died.\n\nAzurah sat in the Great Darkness for timeless ages, musing on what she had learned and mourning the loss of her mother. Still she wept, and now the darkness fled from her tears and from the Lunar Lattice. She wept for so long that soon she was no longer in the Great Darkness, but in a place of moonlight and shadow. \n\nAnd Azurah tried to return to Fadomai-Mother, but her tears had formed a great sea. Beyond it was a black gate that opened into a hungering dark.\n\nLorkhaj stood in the doorway. He was broken and bleeding, and there was a hole in his chest. But the Great Darkness was still in his blood, and it filled the hole where his heart had been. The dark mass beat like a heart, and black blood spilled out onto the threshold. Azurah heard each beat of the heart like the beating of a drum, and each drop of blood tapped to form a rhythm she felt in her tail.\n\nBut Fadomai had taught Azurah the names of all of the spirits, so she recognized the Great Darkness for what it was, and she roared in time with the song:\n\nUR DRA NA MII RA UR DRA NA MII RA UR DRA AZU RA\n\nAnd Azurah tore out the dark heart of Lorkhaj, and all of the darkness in him came with it, and she cast it beyond the sea. \n\nFrom the Dark Heart of Lorkhaj was born the Moon Beast, the first of the dro-m'Athra, who lurks at the edge of the Lattice and knows nothing but hunger.\n\nAnd with the darkness bled from him, Azurah could see her mother in Lorkhaj, and she held him until he died. \n\nAzurah burned what remained of his body before the gate, lighting the fire with lanterns of love and mercy. She wept for her brother Lorkhaj, and her tears fell upon the pyre. \n\nAs the ashes of Lorkhaj scattered across the Lattice, even the Moon Beast became silent for a time.\n\nThen Azurah dried her eyes at last and went unto the World. Her time of grieving was over, and Fadomai had given her so much to do."

msgid "Thava-ko sings now a song of Riddle'Thar. Let its sweetest truth rest upon Thava-ko's tongue.\n\nHear Thava-ko's voice, children of the Two-Moons Dance. Word reaches us in the Torval Curiata that an ancient book—a pre-ri'Datta catalog of spirits, assembled by an ancient priest named Amun-dro—has captured the imaginations of Khajiit throughout Pellitine. Our people seem taken with its colorful and otherworldly descriptions of powerful spirits, both good and evil. Adepts from far and wide have come to Thava-ko with curious hearts and twitching tails, asking why they were not taught these old scriptures. We Khajiit are a curious and playful people, but some subjects carry great risk. We cannot, in good conscience, allow this heretical document to fester in the minds of light-minded ja'Khajiit. For that reason, Thava-ko and her fellow priests publish this refutation. Spread this far and wide, faithful litter of Rid-Thar-ri'Datta.\n\nIn the dark times before the First Mane's revelation, our forebears held scattered beliefs—sixteen faiths that tumbled and scratched their way through history, competing for the souls of all Khajiit. This spiritual chaos led us down many paths, all of which carried great risk. You need only look upon our bent kin, the dro-m'Athra, to find the proof of these perils. This book of profanities is the product of those dark times. Shall we return to the era of sixteen wars, and hunter-fiefs, and pitiless famine? No, and no, and no again! In the truth of Riddle'Thar, we find more than spiritual fulfillment. We find a rock to build upon—an end to the shifting sands of old. We find a better path through peace and order.\n\nThis old text carries greater danger because it hides its blasphemies under a shroud of truth. Many of its attestations walk paw-in-paw with Riddle'Thar, such as its praise for the Moons, and its deference to the blessed spirits: Khenarthi, S'rendarr, and others. But its darker fables lay hidden like snares. Take, for instance, its account of the Moon Beast, Lorkhaj.\n\nWho knows noisy Lorkhaj's darkness better than the Khajiit? We all suffer the call to the Dark at some point in our lives. Who among us has not heard the beating drum of the Dark Heart in our moments of deepest sorrow or most anguished regret? To lift up the first dro-m'Athra as a hero of our people defies both faith and reason. How many adepts shall fall to Namiira on account of this document? How many ja'khajiit will call on the Moon Beast, intent on reviving his true spirit, only to be swallowed by his eternal curse? Any thief can tell you that the surest path to a victim's purse starts with a smile. A smiling Lorkhaj is too dangerous to contemplate."

msgid "By Xandria Prevette, Scholar-at-Large\n\nMuch attention has been paid to the depredations of Dragons in Northern Elsweyr (also called Anequina), but Southern Elsweyr also faces a plague of these vile creatures. This is a record of my experiences with these beasts—from afar, of course. I'm no Dragon hunter!\n\nWhile traveling near Senchal, I met my first witness to a Dragon. They described a great red beast as it swooped across the sky. Before the Dragon could attack, the witness fled. I do not judge those who choose the wiser course of action, but I am not one to run away. Instead, I seek to categorize and record.\n\nI ventured to where the witness last saw this red Dragon. Luckily, it lingered in the area, so I was able to approach and observe it for a time. I noticed a strangeness in the horn formation—was it missing part of a horn? After a while, the Dragon flew off. It never harmed a thing. I know not its purpose in that area, but was intrigued that it caused neither chaos nor damage. Very much unlike what has been reported in the north. Is it possible this Dragon was benign? Alas, I have an absence of evidence to quantify such a claim.\n\nShortly thereafter, a different red Dragon appeared in a burned-out area near Senchal, clearly intent on hunting. A group of Dragon hunters also came through, and a great battle ensued. I watched, hoping to learn the Dragon's name as it shouted and roared. After it fell to the hunters but before it died, I approached the Dragon and asked, ""Please share your name so that I may record it.""\n\n""You are not worthy of my name, mortal,"" It said. Then it expired. A shame. Perhaps the next Dragon will prove to be more cooperative. For posterity, you understand. I placed both of these red Dragons under ""Unnamed Dragons,"" as Brother Mathnan did in his Atlas of Dragons, 2E 373.\n\nNext, I heard that a black Dragon was spotted near a quarry to the south. I headed there quickly on my faithful steed, hoping to see this one in action. Luck was with me yet again. The Dragon perched on a rock overlooking the quarry, speaking to figures I could not quite see.\n\n""I am Laatvulon, your master, and you will do as I say,"" it roared.\n\nHow fortunate I was to hear the Dragon speak its own name! I wrote it down and departed as quickly as I could, realizing I was just a little too close to a Dragon and its minions for my own comfort, scholarly pursuits be damned.\n\nI returned to Senchal, where I overheard some refugees talking about a new Dragonguard. Could such an ancient order actually return to help us against the Dragons? I should seek them out. For my research, you understand.\n\nI wonder who I know who might help with the introductions?"

msgid "by Amun-dro, the Silent Priest\n\nAkha. The First Cat, whom we know as the Pathfinder and the One Unmourned. In the earliest days, when Ahnurr and Fadomai were still in love, he explored the heavens and his trails became the Many Paths. He was Ahnurr's Favored Son, and his father told him to find love like Ahnurr found with Fadomai. Akha mated with the Winged Serpent of the East, the Dune Queen of the West, and the Mother Mammoth of the North. He then went to the South and never returned. Instead, Alkosh appeared speaking warnings of the things Akha had made along the Many Paths. Since then, Alkosh and his faithful watch over the many children of Akha, for they are both terrible and kind.\n\nAlkosh. The Dragon King. The Highmane. He was granted rule over the myriad kingdoms of Akha along the Many Paths. In time, the children of Akha overthrew him and scattered his body on the West Wind. It is said that when Khenarthi learned this, she flew across the Many Paths and put Alkosh back together. In doing so, she saw all the things Akha had wrought, including those that should not be. Now, Alkosh and Khenarthi safeguard the Many Paths from the wayward children of Akha. Pray to Alkosh not for his strength or his mighty roar, but for his sense of duty and purpose.\n\nAlkhan. The Scaled Prince. Firstborn of Akha, who bred with a demon of fire and shadow. He can devour the souls of those he kills to grow to an immense size. The songs tell us Alkhan was slain by Lorkhaj and his companions, but as an immortal Son of Akha he will return from the Many Paths in time. He is the enemy of Alkosh, Khenarthi, and Lorkhaj, and ever hungers for his crown.\n\nBoethra. The Warrior of the East and West. She is the mate of Mafala, who did not forget her love for Boethra after Ahnurr sent her into exile for her rebellious nature. Boethra walked the Many Paths in exile, and she returned. It was she who pried the eye from Magrus, and this is why Khajiit value swords as well as claws. There is no need for a True Cat to pray to Boethra, as you honor this spirit merely by walking the Path, and only hiding in order to pounce. It is forbidden to say her name on nights of the Ghost Moon, as during these phases Boethra dons the death-shroud of Lorkhaj and wages war beyond the Lattice.\n\nMafala. The Teaching Mother. Elder Spirit and the Keeper of the Ancient Secrets of Fadomai. These were the secrets her children only needed in the beginning, and it was Mafala that carried them down. She watches over Eight of the Many Paths, each of which a Khajiit must walk in time. Mafala aids the Clan Mothers in guiding the Khajiiti people along the Path and protecting our secrets from Others. She is an ally of Azurah, Boethra, and Lorkhaj. Her numbers are Eight and Sixteen, and these are two of her keys."

He tests Khajiit on the Path by making them doubt the truth of their own thoughts, beliefs, and actions. He must be faced along the Path and overcome before a Khajiit can visit Hermorah's library. Some tribes believe Sheggorath is dead and has been replaced by something Other.\n\nOrkha. A demon that followed Boethra back through the Many Paths. It spoke in curses of affliction and knew no other words. Lorkhaj, Khenarthi, and Boethra battled the demon in the ancient songs, but Orkha could only be banished and would not die. Khajiit understand that Orkha and others of his ilk serve as tests along the Path, and nothing more.\n\nDagon. The Demon Cat. Also called Merrunz. Born of Fadomai's Second Litter, he quickly turned destructive and wild. Ahnurr exiled him, but he chose to explore the Great Darkness rather than the Many Paths. There he fell to the demon Molagh, who tortured him until the creation of the World. During the chaos, it is written that the wife of Molagh freed Merrunz and used his destructive nature as a weapon against the Lattice. Merrunz reveled in this and became a kinslayer, and was henceforth the demon we call Dagon. You will face him on the Path. \n\nMolagh. One of the twelve Demon Kings. Elder Spirit of Domination and Supreme Law. This demon was the first to assault the Lattice with intent, alongside Dagon and Merid-Nunda. Boethra and Molagh fought to a standstill before the Lattice, but it was Azurah who shackled the Demon King with secrets only she knows. He will test you, and you will overcome him with the might of Boethra, the Will Against Rule. \n\nMerid-Nunda. False Spirit of Greed. The Orphaned Glimmer. She is the daughter of Magrus, who loved only himself and his own creations. Magrus did not take a mate, but instead forged children of the aether. Merid-Nunda is a cold spirit, born of light without love. She is intellect without wisdom, knowledge without purpose. She is the consort of demons, and some songs blame her for orchestrating the death of mighty Lorkhaj. When Merid-Nunda dared assault the Lattice, Azurah struck her down before the Varliance Gate and dragged her away from it. She then cast Merid-Nunda into the Void and bound her there with mirrors. The nomads say she has since escaped."

I feel crushed here amid all the people needing food. Needing clean water. Needing clothes. Needing. So much needing. I know you call me overly sensitive, but it's more an overabundance of empathy. How can I not give the food I found to someone else who needs it more? I've already lost so much weight since this started, and it's only going to get worse because I can't live with this continual guilt of eating when others go without. Do I need this sustenance more than these people who just came into the city? Than the ones who barely survived a Dragon attack? I can't keep food down when these are my constant thoughts. The pressure to help others at my own expense, while the pure overwhelming sense of everyone needing so much is going to kill me. So, I must leave.\n\nI'm heading north to Rimmen. From there, I don't know where I'll end up. Perhaps Summerset via another port town, though I know the High Elves will do me no favors.

msgid "This Journal Belongs to Julia Runellius\n\nFather told me that if I were to travel and fill bounties, I needed to keep a journal of my activities. He handed me this blank book and told me to fill it. I'm not much of one for writing, but I'll honor his request as best I can. I'm here in Senchal now. Following the trail of a lost soul. Gian Mico. He's wanted for several crimes, not least of which is stealing some important books from the Mages Guild in Daggerfall. Books? Of all the things to steal! He last showed up here. My guess is that he thought being among the Khajiit would keep him safe enough, especially since there is an Imperial presence here that he can blend into.\n\nBut I'll find him.\n\nDay Two: Senchal\n\nI walked around the city. You can't take a step without bumping into a refugee or a flustered Khajiit. A militia of sorts marginally protects the city. They call them the Shields of Senchal. It was originally the Thirteenth Legion, but the locals gave them their new name after they settled in and started to police the place. They don't run the city, though. Just enforce whatever rules the Khajiit want them to enforce, from the sound of things.\n\nMy bet is that Mico has joined them. Perhaps I should do the same just long enough to find my target.\n\nDay Three: The Shields\n\nOh by all the gods, these Alfiq! I don't know how it got into my room, but it woke me up with purring, as if it were a housecat, then said clear as day, ""Time to get up, walker."" I'm not sure what to do. If this were another Imperial, I'd smash their nose in then kick them out of my room. But it's a creature that reminds me a bit of Mouser, my first cat. I just nodded at it, then asked it to leave, polite as can be.\n\nAfter breakfast, I talked to some fellow named Bruccius about the Shields and how they recruit new candidates. Though he seemed like he wanted to complain about his aches or send me after some wayward priest, I kept him on topic and asked what the new recruits did. He helpfully pointed me to an area of the city where they train. I think I'll head over there and see if I can pick out Mico.\n\nDay Four: Bureaucracy\n\nI spent most of today talking to various Shields. Mico was indeed among the new recruits. I went to the person in charge of the training squad and told her about Mico's past activities and my bounty to bring him back to the Mages Guild in Daggerfall. She said she needed to bump this up the chain of command. It wasn't long before I ended up talking to the Shield's commander, General Renmus.\n\nI learned more about the Shields of Senchal in this discussion. They were sent here five years ago by Emperor Aquilarios to help the city restore order in the aftermath of the flu. Without royal guidance since the demise of the ruling family of Senchal, the Imperials helped set up a city council and have been working with them to govern the region. With the arrival of the Dragons, though, refugees are pouring into the city, putting a strain on already stretched resources. He invited me to join the Shields. I guess smart, well-trained combatants are in short supply.\n\nI was honored, of course, but I prefer traveling and working on my own for now.\n\nAnd that is when the general noted that Mico is a very skilled battlemage and had stolen those books in the hope of coming here and destroying Dragons with new magic. He didn't condone the mage's actions, but he also needed as many soldiers as he could get to protect Senchal. So, he refused to release Mico into my hands.\n\nMy first bounty, and I need to make a decision regarding whether to let this bounty go for the greater good or try to persuade the general to let me take him back to Daggerfall to face justice. I've already talked to Mico, and he does indeed wish to fight Dragons with some techniques he uncovered in various tomes he took from the Mages Guild. But theft? Why didn't he work with all those mages to fight Dragons? It's not as if these beasts are going to stick around Elsweyr forever. They're a threat to us all.\n\nAnd, having written that, I think I've made my decision. Father, you were right to give me this journal. Sometimes writing things down removes any foggy thinking. Perhaps my next bounty will be easier. I'll acquire a new book for my next bounty. (Oh, I should note: I'm going to work with those mages who had their books stolen to put them in touch with Mico so they can work together to defeat the Dragons.)"

The terror birds were in their breeding season, so the beasts were particularly ornery. Aken had this great trick he learned from an Argonian, though.

msgid "I fled Senchal today. I couldn't stand to remain behind after what had happened. The flu was bad enough, but to see all that fire? And breathing—so difficult.\n\nEvery time I think about it, I just want to vomit. And when I sneeze, which is often thanks to the smoky air, I darken my fur if I cover my nose.\n\nWe're all dark inside now because of what we've done. Even those of us who tried to stop it. We failed. The darkness is more than just the air we breathe. Our very spirits have dimmed. Maybe even diminished.\n\nAnd now we have to live with ourselves and this devastation that we added to the world. The flu? A terrible thing. But to add to that as we did? We did that. That was us. What hubris! And so much fear. So much bad behavior. It stains us.\n\nBut, start where we are. That's what my grandmother would say. Start where we are.\n\nDespite the darkness inside us that we gave a fiery form, we must keep moving forward.\n\nAnd so I leave Senchal. I leave the miasma of death and destruction behind me. And I will find and heal anyone I encounter outside its walls. I cannot stay around Senchal, no. It sickens me to do so. But I can work my healing on those outside it. Perhaps the flu will find me. Perhaps it won't. That is beyond my control.\n\nZiss. Enough of this.\n\n* * *\nI must write this down before I forget. It has been weeks since the fires. I cannot return to Senchal and be part of that, but I have found a roving community outside the walls. We protect each other. We forage for food. We take in more as we can. And I heal them all with what supplies we can find. The land is not as generous as we would like, but now and again, we find a treasure trove of herbs I can use.\n\nBut I write now because of this: None have died from the flu for several days now. Some have recovered. Some have not. But none have sickened in the past several days. Perhaps we should head north and see if the so-called barbarians of Anequina will be kinder than the ""civilized people"" of Senchal were. Or maybe we will discover more fear-driven and hubris-driven behavior. That is beyond our control.\n\nWe will start where we are. Move forward. Make each step count.\n\n* * *\nZiss! It has been … decades? I forgot I wrote down my pain in this little journal and tucked it into one of our hidden safeholds. Those were dark days. We were staving off more than the flu back then. We fought off fear and starvation. Lived off the land without destroying it and ourselves. But one thing everyone in that group had in common: We knew we needed to be better. Do better. Have more empathy. Be kind. And learn patience. With others, and most of all with ourselves.\n\nYes, devastation surrounded us for quite a while as we traveled. We saw many behaving badly. We tried to offset that as much as we could, and to some extent, we succeeded. Not as much as we'd like, but the path was the effort, not the result.\n\nI shall leave this little book behind with the hopes that any who pick it up will remember these words: Start where you are. Each moment, and especially when facing the worst things you can imagine, that's all you can do. Start where you are.\n\nRiifa, Itinerant Healer"

msgid "By Sulema, Initiate Scholar of the Pa'alatiin\n\nWith love for those who raised this one, who succumbed to the flu. You breathed life into this one's heart before your passing.\n\nFor those compiling a history of the city-state of Senchal, we must rise to a series of challenges. The very nature of how Senchal came into being lies heavily within the realm of song and oral history passed among clans of Khajiit. Various calamities compound the difficulties facing a scholar researching this city, such as loss of property during various chaotic periods, which of course affected any written lore. That said, this one has found some resources that provide us with a brief overview of the history of Senchal. Given the nature of these resources, however, approach what follows with the same caution you would use when sneaking past a terror bird.\n\nThe Formation of Senchal\n\nThe early days of the Khajiit within the province now called Elsweyr saw them separated into sixteen different clans, each of which performed a different function. The location that is now Senchal was originally a favored landing place of the Senchal clan, who were skilled at building ships and sailing them from port to port.\n\nAs trade increased, the Khajiit built dwellings and businesses, creating permanent structures. Fires demolished these buildings upon occasion in the early days, which led them to the use of stone. At this time, a class system started forming among the merchants, traders, and raiders. From this, the infamous Black Kiergo section of town was born (the rumored stomping grounds of Rajhin), catering to raiders and thieves, while the rest of the town had its own sections based on social status, including the home of the clan leader.\n\nThe Thrassian Plague\n\nThe budding city-state of Senchal continued to grow until the Thrassian Plague in 1E 2260. According to a partially burnt journal, author unknown:\n\n""… many dead to this Thrassian Plague, with the rest in a panic. This one thinks it best to flee, but they have closed the gates. The smuggler tunnels burn, trapping those within Black Kiergo. They will die fiery deaths, no doubt. This one hates to think of even the worst of them dying that way. This one also worries that those fires will spread to the remaining wooden structures, and then to the stone buildings. Already, this one cannot breathe due to smoke. Wet cloth over the mouth does only so much. Curse those who set those fires. They will kill those of us who don't fall to ….""\n\nPresumably, the author was referring to the plague at the end. And indeed, the fires spread, burning flammable objects and scorching stone. This one doubts any survived. Scattered evidence indicate that Senchal required extensive rebuilding after these fires.\n\nRebuilding Senchal\n\nOver the next several decades, the city grew back, solidifying its social structure even as its physical structures were rebuilt. Black Kiergo remained a haven for thieves, raiders, and others who operated outside the law. The political structure for the entire region of Pellitine changed after the plague, and now the ruler of the city also ruled the region. Clan identity fell completely away and was replaced by one's role within Senchal's society, a change linked to both Breton and Imperial influence. Most of Pellitine's rulers during this period focused on creating a sense of stability, sometimes at the expense of doing what some would consider to be ""fair"" or ""just.""\n\nOne ruler stands out due to his ties with the Imperials: King Dro'Zel. In 1E 2920, after hearing a bard tell a tale, he summoned Molag Bal to destroy the town of Gil-Var-Delle. Shortly thereafter, he became one of the new advisors to Emperor Reman Cyrodiil III. Ties to the Imperial throne strengthened until, after Reman III died, Potentate Versidue-Shaie took over the Empire. Additionally, further political change came to Senchal in the form of the marriage of Eshita of Pellitine to Keirgo of Anequina in 2E 309, forming the province of Elsweyr from their separate regions.\n\nThen, in a well-known story, Potentate Versidue-Shaie reportedly died at the hands of an unnamed assassin in 2E 324 in Senchal Palace, where he was residing at the time.\n\nRecent Events\n\nAfter the death of Versidue-Shaie, another blow landed: Khajiiti rebels slaughtered most of Elsweyr's royal dynasty. The citizens of Senchal fell back on their now-entrenched traditions and social structures to remain resilient, and life didn't look too different for the average person in Senchal until 2E 565, when the Knahaten Flu devastated the city.\n\nAccording to reports, this illness originated in Black Kiergo, and, as happened with the Thrassian Plague, fire was seen as the ultimate solution. Unknowingly, frightened residents repeated the same act that destroyed Senchal so many years before. Many suffered and died from the smoke and flames as well as the actual illness, and the Senchal of today remains a pale shadow of its former glory.\n\nNow Imperial forces reside within the city, serving as a sort of local militia, while Khajiit work to rebuild yet again. This one looks forward to seeing what comes of this mix of Khajiit and Imperial ingenuity, given the current state of Cyrodiil."

msgid "by Amun-dro, the Silent Priest\n\nAzurah. The Mother of All Khajiit. Queen of the Night Sky, the Realms of Twilight, and the Dusk and Dawn. The Favored Daughter of Fadomai. Her spheres are many, for she carries the burdens of our ancestors. All tribes know Azurah as the God of Magic, Beauty, and Prophecy. She is also the keeper of all gates and keys, all rims and thresholds. Khajiit know it was Azurah that lifted us up and bound us to the Lunar Lattice, and thus broke us from the chains of fate so that we alone shape our own future. Hers is the gift of ja-Kha'jay and all our perfect forms. It is written that she knows the names of all the Khajiit that will ever live. You must come to know her yourself, for that is the first step on the Path.\n\nKhenarthi. Elder Spirit of the Heavens, who sings her songs with the wind and rain when she passes close to Nirni. The most ancient sounds were gifted to the world by this spirit, and we honor her with music, song, and the speaking of myths. For some tribes she also serves as a spirit of mourning, as it is written that when Lorkhaj died she hid herself in a storm and wept until Alkosh came to comfort her. Khenarthi carries the souls of dead Khajiit to Azurah for judgment, and is also her messenger. At the end of time, it is her clarion call that will summon the eternal united spirit of all Khajiit to defend creation.\n\nJone and Jode. The Ever-Mourned. The spirits of the stillborn twins of Fadomai, who still dance in the Lunar Lattice. Khenarthi held them when they were born, and did not have the heart to tell her dying mother the truth. She lit two lanterns to make their eyes bright and rocked them in the sky until her mother passed. Azurah cares for them now and lights the lanterns again when they burn low. The love of Jone and Jode spreads to all Khajiit as moonlight and sugar. To give your praise to these spirits, you must sing Khenarthi's lullaby on nights of Bright Moons.\n\nLorkhaj. The Moon Prince. Fadomai's Favored Son. The White Lion. He was born in the Great Darkness and it followed him as his burden. Loved by many, he was considered a noble leader. Lorkhaj was the first spirit to make his own path with purpose, because he was in conflict with himself as soon as he was born. His courage inspired all those he encountered, so much that he united the spirits to make the World. He gave his life to do this. We honor his sacrifice by walking the Path with purpose and resisting the call of the Dark. Lorkhaj represents the duality of the Khajiiti soul and the hardships that all Khajiit must overcome. In her wisdom, Azurah lit her brother's pyre with the Twin Lanterns of Jone and Jode, and thus the true spirit of Lorkhaj will sometimes appear—but only when called by Azurah or Khenarthi, or by his oldest name.\n\nMagrus. The Sun God. Commonly known as the Cat's Eye or the Third Eye of Azurah, He serves as a daily reminder of her wrath. It is written that when Magrus fled from Boethra and Lorkhaj, he could only see out of one eye and fell into the Moonshadow. There Azurah judged him as too full of fear to rule a sphere, and she tore out his other eye. Magrus left to the heavens blinded, but Azurah made of his eye a stone to reflect the Varliance Gate. This is the Aether Prism, which opens at Dawn and closes at Dusk. Some sorcerers hold that Magrus left the eye willingly as an offering to Azurah and her children, and these magi still utter prayers to his name."

msgid "by Amun-dro, the Silent Priest\n\nLorkhaj. The Moon Beast. Born of the dark heart of Lorkhaj, which overcame him after he suffered a great betrayal. In his wisdom, Lorkhaj sought his sister Azurah, who tore the darkness from him before it consumed him and cast it into the Void. We know this shade of Lorkhaj as the first of the Dro-m'Athra, who serve the Ur-Dra Namiira, our enemy. The Moon Beast prowls the edges of the Lattice and pounces on Khajiit who stray too far off the Path. Know that on nights of the Ghost Moon, Azurah has opened the Void Gate and the Moon Beast will challenge mortals until banished. We accept this burden as part of the Path, and for the sake of our Lost Kin.\n\nNamiira. The Eldest Spirit. The Great Darkness. The Void. All creatures who feed on rotten flesh are her spies and the prey of Cats. The Lunar Lattice protects us from her hunger, but not our own. Know that to name her aloud is to invite the Dark, so you must never do so, as Namiira is the sound of her true name. She is a spirit of infinite realms, of which only Azurah knows all. Mortals who become ensnared by this spirit are tortured until they forget who they were and know only Namiira. This is eternal suffering for all souls but the ja-Kha'jay, whom Azurah will not abandon to the Dark.\n\nNoctra. The Shadow Thief. Daughter of Twilight. Born from the black blood of Lorkhaj at the steps of the Void Gate. In the songs, Boethra battled this spirit until it knew it was not Namiira. When this was done, Noctra was brought before Azurah to be judged. Azurah showed mercy and allowed Noctra to live, so long as she served Azurah and the ja-Kha'jay. But Noctra is rebellious by nature, so she stole one of Azurah's keys and fled back into the Void. It is written that Azurah sent the true spirit of Lorkhaj to find her, and ever since Noctra has aided the Khajiit when called. Tribes may whisper to Noctra for silence, shade, and luck. Do not summon her to perform vile deeds, for this will bring the Dark with her.\n\nVarmiina. Queen of Nightmares. The Lost Daughter. This spirit was not of any litter, but was born from Fadomai's fear of losing her children. Azurah killed this dark spirit in the Underworld, and now Varmiina only haunts Khajiit when they dream. Know she will test you and make you want to turn from the Path in fear, but she cannot truly harm the ja-Kha'jay in dreams.\n\n[?????] A spirit of vengeance. It has no will of its own, as it was born from Azurah's grief after the death of Fadomai and Lorkhaj. None can summon this spirit save Azurah, Boethra, and Mafala, for only they know its true name. It sometimes appears in songs as a black panther, a warrior in ebony armor, or as a hidden sword."

msgid "by Amun-dro, the Silent Priest\n\nNirni. The Green Mother. Spirit of Harmony. Though her spirit has diminished, Nirni can still be felt in the warm sands, dense jungles, and all places where mortals have not disturbed the earth. The Khajiit are her secret defenders, for her spirit seeds life on the Mortal Plane. This was Lorkhaj's gift to Nirni. Because she always tried to compete with Azurah for Fadomai's favor, she is sometimes called the Jealous Sister. Despite this, it is said she was the only spirit more beautiful than Azurah.\n\nY'ffer. The Elden Shaper. One of the Bastard Sons of Ahnurr. Unlike his father, he was wise and kind. He convinced Nirni to be his mate by creating the first flower, and they had many children. Y'ffer was corrupted by the Great Darkness sometime after the death of Lorkhaj. Consumed by chaos, Y'ffer struck Nirni, killing her. Azurah, Khenarthi, and Hircine destroyed him in vengeance and made a cairn for Nirni out of his bones. Some woodland folk say they can still hear his voice, but we Khajiit no longer speak of him.\n\nHircine. The Hunter. Spirit of Pursuit and Purposeful Change. Hircine was in love with Nirni, but she chose Y'ffer as her mate. In his sorrow, Hircine slew Y'ffer's champion, the Graht-Elk. Now he wears its head as a trophy. He is fond of Nirni's children and walks among them often. Khajiit should pray to Hircine when they have strayed from the Path, for the Father of the Hunt will always set them back upon it. Some tribes claim Hircine is the father of Nirni's first litter, who were as changeable as the Moons. They say these children were chosen as vessels for the ja-Kha'jay.\n\nHermorah. The Watcher. Spirit of the Tides. Hermorah records all the events he perceives and stores them away in a great library under the sea. A patient spirit, he helped Azurah maintain the Moons and their Motions after the world was made and Khenarthi could no longer bear to do so. He is the Keeper of the Knowledge of Others, and he shares all he learns with Azurah, who walks the halls of his library often. You should not call on this spirit unless you wish to be tested along the Path. It is best to leave Hermorah to his duty.\n\nSangiin. Blood God of the Second Litter. Sangiin is not an evil spirit by nature, but Khajiit must know that all things within his sphere turn True Cats from the Path. These are the urges of blood and pleasure without purpose. To fall to Sangiin is not to give in to the Dark, but to give in to the flesh. He tries to tempt Khajiit into making their flesh immortal, and this is a prison to all spirits of the ja-Kha'jay. Sangiin is therefore a spirit that will test you on the Path and must be overcome. The secret to defeating him is to ignore him, and this we learned from Mafala, who said: Lust for nothing but Truth."
