msgid "Dear Thane Vigli Storm-Breast,\n\nHonored leader of the Nord Cultural Exchange, it is I, Rigurt the Brash, writing to you in Windhelm as you requested. I have arrived in the hot and sandy land of Northern Elsweyr, home of the Khajiit cat people. It is very hot. And sandy. And you wouldn't believe how many Khajiit live here! It is more than Rigurt can count on both hands and even his feet!\n\nRigurt wants you to know that he is hip-deep in making friendly overtures to the nice cat people. Soon we will have a signed peace treaty and a fully operational cultural exchange. Has Rigurt ever failed you before. Well, except for that one time. And that other one. But I digest. And speaking of digesting, let me tell you about all the amazing food Rigurt has consumed here in the land of Anequina! (That's what the cat people call Northern Elsweyr.) \n\nFirst, let me tell you about the cat food. Much of it is sweet, but it is also quite delicious. Goes well with mead, too. Three particular dishes stood out for Rigurt. I even acquired the recipes, so I can cook them for you when I return to Windhelm. We will have a feast fit for the Skald King! Do you think he would like to join us?\n\nI came upon a stall in a back alley in Rimmen where a twitchy little doggy-cat (don't ask me, the different types of Khajiit confuse Rigurt, too) was stirring a large pot from which wafted a most-pleasing aroma. It reminded me of the Thane Jeggi's Drinking Hole—a combination of the pungent smell of fish and the sweet smell of spilled mead. Turns out, the doggy-cat was cooking what he referred to as sweet-glazed fish bits. I didn't know that fishes had bits, but when tossed with moon-sugar and stir-fried to a crispy crunch, they make for a nice afternoon snack. Rigurt ate four servings!\n\nIn the town of Riverhold, Rigurt entered the Inn of Banished Regrets as I have many, many regrets that need banishing. Immediately, Rigurt noticed that all the cat people were not only drinking—they were eating crunchy little nuggets by the handful! Rigurt's mouth gushes with saliva just writing down these words! Who knew you could turn smelly, scaly lizards into delicious crunchy lizard kibble? It cost me a week's worth of mead, but I was able to convince the inn's cook to give me a copy of the recipe. It seems that the cat people can't stop eating the stuff, and Rigurt feels the same way. I just wish I hadn't read the recipe. Turns out, they use the inside of the lizard to make kibble, not the outside!\n\nOne dish that tasted amazing was the meat-cake pie I had at a cart in the Stitches. My taste buds did loops as they savory-sweet succulent slid down from my mouth to my tummy. Was it the main meal or dessert? It seemed to Rigurt to be both at the same time! It was confusing but very tasty. The chef refused to enlighten Rigurt as to what kind of actual meat was used as the filling. All she would say was, ""a little of this and a little of that."" I will have to experiment when I get back to my own kitchen. Do not worry, I will make enough to share!\n\nNow, by this point in my trip, Rigurt has just about had his fill of sweet, sweet Khajiiti cooking. I was desperate to find a spicy rabbit meatball or a haunch of stewed mutton, but such Nord delicacies don't seem to exist in Northern Elsweyr. But I did find a bottle of Dark Moons spiced whiskey. While mead is the nectar of the gods, this spiced whiskey that the cat people distill burns so good on the way down. Rigurt got the impression that it was the beverage of choice for when even the Khajiiti sweet-tooth needs a break from all the syrupy goodness they consume on a regular basis. I acquired three casks of the stuff and plan to put it on the next boat to Skyrim as a gift for the Skald King. I know how much Jorunn appreciates a strong drink when he listens to my latest cultural report.\n\nRigurt the Brash, Ambassador-at-Large for the Nord Cultural Exchange"

msgid "To: Lord Gharesh-ri, Speaker of the Mane\nFrom: Khamira, Agent of the Speaker\n\nWe know that the Usurper Queen employs necromancers and dark sorcery, and has done so from the beginning of her reign. In recent months, however, the number of necromancers supporting her forces have increased dramatically. It all comes back to one source—the dark mage and Euraxia's chief necromancer, Zumog Phoom.\n\nZumog Phoom, the self-proclaimed ""lord of the dark arts,"" reportedly hails from the northernmost climes of Wrothgar. Maddeningly few facts concerning this Orc necromancer can be gleaned from his early life, though suppositions are plentiful. We know that the wilds of Wrothgar are unforgiving, and life among the Orc strongholds is often harsh, bleak, and brutal. Still, we know that those Orcs who not only survive but flourish resemble a well-made sword that has been forged, beaten, and sharpened to a razor's edge.\n\nThe first real evidence of his existence prior to Anequina appears in intelligence reports investigating the activities of the Worm Cult during the Planemeld crisis. While details remain slim, Zumog Phoom's name appears as a ranking member of the cult and hints at a close connection to Mannimarco, leader of the Order of the Black Worm. However, we know that he was active here in Rimmen shortly after the Frostfall Coup, so he probably did not have a direct hand in the cult's activities during the Planemeld.\n\nEuraxia either specifically recruited Zumog Phoom or was approached by the Orc after she claimed the throne of Rimmen. He had a small group of followers at first, lesser necromancers that formed the basis of his personal dark cult. The Northern Elsweyr Defense Force occasionally faced a lone zombie or a small group of skeletons, but for the most part, the necromancers have served little more than a supporting role in Euraxia's army. I fear that may be about to change.\n\nSince the end of the Planemeld and the apparent disbanding of the Worm Cult, a great number of necromancers have flocked to the Usurper Queen's banner to learn from the cruel yet charismatic Zumog Phoom. The few sorcerers that we have captured demonstrate an almost manic reverence for their Orc leader, regaling us with tales of his dark powers and threats of what he and Euraxia will do once Elsweyr is totally under their control. They revealed few actionable details while still providing hints about what Zumog Phoom is doing in his hidden lairs and ""undead forges""—their term, not mine.\n\nIf the rumors are to be believed, Zumog Phoom and his acolytes have established manufactories away from prying eyes where they can perform rituals, conduct experiments, and raise an army of undead soldiers to bolster Euraxia's mercenary forces. We have yet to see the products of these vile places, but we have discovered evidence of grave robbing throughout the region, especially around Ashen Scar and other mass graves from the worst period of the Knahaten flu outbreak.\n\nSpeaker, we must find a means for dealing with Zumog Phoom and his followers before they provide Euraxia with an unlimited supply of soldiers. The Defense Force cannot repel an army that does not tire and can be ceaselessly replenished. Our best chance is to locate the undead forges and destroy them before they can be turned up to full capacity.\n\nAnd if we can kill Zumog Phoom, so much the better."

msgid "Implications for Elsweyr and the Aldmeri Dominion\n\nBy Tandemen, Sapiarch of Foreign Observations\n\nIt was in the year 2E 576, four years before the return of Ayrenn and the formation of the Aldmeri Dominion, that Euraxia Tharn murdered the Royal Family of Anequina and illegally claimed the throne of Rimmen. How did this occur and what should the Dominion do about it? Allow me to provide a few pertinent observations.\n\nEarlier that same year, Emperor Leovic legalized the worship of Daedra throughout the Empire of Cyrodiil, which immediately sparked a rebellion. As Varen Aquilarios began his own push to take control of the Empire, Euraxia Tharn was sent on a diplomatic mission to Northern Elsweyr. Taking advantage of the confusion, she hired a massive force of Nibenese mercenaries and marched into Rimmen as a welcomed ally. As part of the Empire, King Hemakar of Rimmen did not think twice about accepting an envoy of the Emperor. That turned out to be a deadly mistake.\n\nEuraxia had King Hemakar and the rest of the Royal Family executed and declared herself Queen of Rimmen. Her mercenaries, now wearing the livery of Euraxians, spread out and quickly conquered all of Northern Elsweyr, claiming the territory from Riverhold to Rimmen. Once in power, Euraxia worked quickly to consolidate her position. She hired additional mercenaries, acquired the services of a cult of necromancers, and established a perimeter of siege weapons to maintain her hold over Rimmen. The Khajiiti people have not fared well under Euraxian rule. In every meaning of the word, her reign has been nothing short of tyrannical.\n\nOnce the dust settled and what was happening became clear, the Khajiit formed a militia to combat the Euraxians and attempt to reclaim Anequina. When Queen Ayrenn established the alliance and formed the Dominion, she promised the Khajiiti people that they would have her support in regaining control of Northern Elsweyr. However, before any forces could be mustered in that regard, the Three Banners War broke out. Except for a handful of military advisors and some much-needed gold, the Khajiiti Defense Force has been primarily on its own. Lord Gharesh-ri, Speaker of the Mane, traveled to Anequina to take command of the militia, and under his guidance they are close to liberating the town of Riverhold and most of the territory beyond the walls of Rimmen.\n\nUnfortunately, Rimmen remains a bastion for Euraxia, primarily due to the siege weapons that ring the palace and are aimed directly into the city below. Her threat, which Gharesh-ri has no reason to doubt, is that she will destroy the city if her rule there is challenged in any way. Until those siege weapons are dealt with, I expect Euraxia will maintain hold of the Rimmen throne.\n\nWhile the Three Banners War rages on, Dominion forces cannot be diverted to deal with the tyrant the Khajiit call the Usurper Queen. We must hope that by providing funds and advisors, the Khajiiti militia can hold out until the alliance conflict comes to an end. Otherwise, the Dominion may wind up facing a threat from within its own borders once the war against the Ebonheart Pact and the Daggerfall Covenant ends."

msgid "What a fascinating place, the Orcrest sewers. You can find a staggering amount of wildlife in these putrid depths! As an explorer and amateur naturalist, I find that extremely convenient for my work.\n\nI confess, I came to Orcrest in search of its sewer system with a specific goal in mind. I had heard rumors of a specimen of amorphous green slime transported from distant Murkmire for the express goal of alchemical study in an Orcrest laboratory. It is said that the creature escaped captivity during the chaos and unrest at the height of the disease that ravaged the city. Supposedly, the blob of slime slithered down into the sewer, where it grew to an enormous size and more potent toxicity due to the disease-ridden detritus flowing down there for it to consume.\n\nSo, with notebook and quill in hand, I braved the perils of Orcrest and found an access to the sewer. I encountered a number of small blobs that were scavenging through the waste and debris, but no huge monstrosity. Disappointed, I decided to push on. That's when I discovered the great pit and the impressive mass of slime that ruled there. I named it Noordigloop the Clog!\n\nGazing upon the impressive creature, I assumed it would be slow and docile giving its size. Imagine my surprise when it rushed after me like a wave of angry ooze! How did it sense my presence? I have no idea! And the smaller voriplasms scattered throughout the area, were they separate creatures or simply extensions of mighty Noordigloop? Further study will be required. Unfortunately, I write this from a hiding spot that I am hesitant to vacate while the slimes continue to search for me. I am going to wait a little while longer, then attempt to get close enough to Noordigloop to perform a thorough examination.\n\nMaybe I can even acquire a sample of its vibrant slime to bring back to my alchemical workshop. Wouldn't that be grand?"

msgid "One of the Times Anequina Saved Khunzar-ri\n\nTranscribed by Aneshi, Keeper of Legends for the 16 Kingdoms\n\nNe Quin-al Rass-Le, called Anequina Sharp-Tongue in the common language of Cyrodiil, wandered the land for many Moons as Khunzar-ri's boon companion. Some called them lovers, which they were at times. Others called them heroes, for they certainly accomplished heroic deeds. One such deed involved the Maormer. During their travels together, Khunzar-ri and Anequina visited the island of Khenarthi's Roost. The Sea Elves and the Cat-folk co-existed on the island, sometimes on friendly terms, sometimes not. This particular event occurred during one of the latter periods.\n\nThere are several versions of this tale. Some focus on how Khunzar-ri saved the day, but the one I like best paints a picture of a different hero. Here is that version of the story.\n\n* * *\nOne of the Sea Elf captains, a brute by the name of Linvalor, kidnapped the daughter of a Moon-Priest and refused all efforts of negotiation for her release. Anequina said she had an idea, but Khunzar-ri rushed off to save the Moon-Priest's daughter before she could stop him. As crafty and powerful as Khunzar-ri was, he could also be reckless. This recklessness allowed Linvalor and his crew of Maormer cutthroats to capture the would-be hero without too much fuss or bother.\n\nNow it fell to Anequina to rescue both the Moon-Priest's daughter and Khunzar-ri. ""How can you succeed when even the great Khunzar-ri failed?"" asked the Moon-Priest. ""Hrrm,"" Anequina purred, ""This one will simply do what she does best. The Sea Elf doesn't stand a chance.""\n\nSo Anequina walked bravely into Linvalor's camp, ignoring the many sword-wielding pirates to stride directly to where the Sea Elf captain was gambling with his officers. They were involved in a close game of Deceiver's Disks, also called Swords and Shields, and didn't even notice her until she was right on top of them and said, ""Hrrm, that looks like an interesting game. Can anyone play or do you only accept gold from wet-earred Elves?""\n\nIntrigued and attracted to Anequina's poise and confidence, Linvalor offered her a seat and dismissed the rest of his crew. ""We will play,"" Linvalor said, ""but not for gold. If I win, then you will sail with me for thirty days and thirty nights as my slave and companion."" Anequina feigned shock at such a proclamation. ""And if this one wins?"" she asked slyly. Linvalor laughed. ""No cat, especially no female cat, has ever bested me in anything! So, name your price, cat, and let us play!""\n\n""Very well,"" Anequina said. ""If this one wins, then all three of us—the Moon-Priest's daughter, Khunzar-ri, and me—walk away, free and clear."" Captain Linvalor, confident that his victory was assured and eager to get the beguiling cat-woman into his bed, agreed.\n\nThe match that followed was intense, with Linvalor bluffing and bellowing his way through every round of play while Anequina pretended ignorance of the rules and fear of every rattle of the disk tumbler. Both were expert players, however, and after many rounds and the consumption of an inordinate amount of wine, it all came down to this. Linvalor had two disks remaining, while Anequina had only one.\n\nThe opponents rattled their remaining disks in their respective tumblers. Then, with much deliberation, they smacked the tumblers down to set the disks so that either their ""sword"" side or ""shield"" side was face up under the container. Linvalor lifted the tumbler slightly and took a quick peek underneath—one each of a sword and shield—before covering his two disks again. Anequina simply smiled, not bothering to look at all. Linvalor knew there were two of one symbol between them. He just had to accurately guess whether it was two swords or two shields. ""Two …"" he started, trying to glean anything from Anequina's calm expression. ""… shields,"" he finished, but it came out more like a question than a statement.\n\n""Oh, you are such a deceiver, captain,"" Anequina said, lifting her tumbler to reveal her disk. A sword. Linvalor wiped sweat from his brow as he plucked one of his disks and set it aside. ""Last toss of the disks, captain,"" she said as they each added their single remaining disk to their tumblers and started shaking them. Anequina blew the Sea Elf a kiss as she slammed her tumbler down. With a growl, he did the same.\n\nLinvalor lifted his tumbler just enough to check. His disk was shield side up. Once again, Anequina refused to check on her disk, so without bothering to check, she said, ""Two shields, since it is obvious that between the two of us, neither of us has a sword."" They each lifted their tumblers to reveal … they each tossed a shield.\n\n""Cheater!"" Linvalor bellowed as he stood, scattering the game components and spilling what remained of the wine. ""Now, now, captain,"" Anequina scolded, ""this one has heard that, if nothing else, Sea Elves were as good as their word. Let us go and Anequina will return in a year and a day for another game."" Reluctantly, the captain agreed. ""Next time, the outcome will be different, cat."" ""This one looks forward to it,"" she purred.\n\nAs they departed with the Moon-Priest's daughter between them, Khunzar-ri asked, ""You cheated, yes?"" Anequina gave him an innocent look. ""And do you really plan to play him again?"" Anequina laughed, ""Of course! How else will this one get one of those sleek pirate ships?"""

This one was trapper in Winterhold long ago, but he has lived in Anequina many years now, learning the language and teaching savannah cats how to catch prey without pouncing. Hrodkir cannot draw, so he will just tell you what to catch. He wishes you luck.\n\nJerboa\n\nThere are many mice in Elsweyr. Hrodkir thinks this is why there are also many cats. Mice and rats aren't usually good eating, Except maybe skeevers, but in Anequina there are bunny-mice called Jerboa that make good meatballs. Truthfully, Hrodkir does not know if they are more bunny or mouse. Have long ears and legs, but also long tails. This one thinks you will know them when you see them. You will see lots of them. They breed quickly. Take two or three daily for meals and they won't even notice. String noose laid over mouth of their den is sure to catch one by nightfall. Hrodkir thinks they taste a little sweet. Must be the moon-sugar they get into.\n\nFennec Foxes\n\nThere are also many large-eared foxes that Hrodkir thinks look like cats, but they are not cats, so you can eat them without getting in trouble. This one thought huge ears were silly, but they work. These foxes are very hard to hunt, but Hrodkir has great method for catching. Gather some scorpions for foxes to eat. They like scorpions. Cut off stingers. Mince garlic and onions. Rub paste on scorpions, good and thick. Paste is poison to foxes. Kills and seasons them at the same time! Foxes remind Hrodkir of wolf, but more tender and less gamey.\n\nFellrunner\n\nBig birds. Not horse big. Goat to deer big. They have long legs and necks, but tiny wings. These birds don't fly or swim. They run. Fast. But very stupid. Hrodkir herds them into trip wires with loud shouting. At full speed they fall and break things. Fragile bones. Fellrunners make good, lean jerky, but are tricky to cook without getting dry. Keep bacon grease for basting.\n\nTerror Birds\n\nBigger birds. Kind of vulture-lizard. They don't fly, but run, leap, and claw. Very strong. Hrodkir has seen one trample a lion. Very smart, too. Hard to trap and dangerous to hunt. This one found one dead and tried meat. Tough, stringy, greasy, and tastes like used boots. Best avoided. Not worth trouble.\n\nThorn Gecko\n\nLike other geckos but has thorns. Good name, yes? They hunt bugs during day and move quick, but at night they look for warmth and are sluggish. Look for dark stone. You find some resting. Grab them with little trouble. Watch thorns, though. Also taste like other geckos. If you like gecko meat, you will like thorn gecko meat.\n\nDaggerback\n\nBristly boar found lots of places. Tusks and quills all around head. Dig a hole. Place blanket over it. Weigh down with rocks. Scatter sand and mushrooms on top of blanket. If hole deep enough, you eat well for weeks. Strong taste. Best in stew.\n\nDesert Alit\n\nMouth with legs. Hrodkir has seen them all over Tamriel. This one thinks desert ones are meanest. Big mouth to feed and not much to eat. Nets traps work best. Once entangled, they can't escape. Skin is tough, but meat is good, if chewy.\n\nSep Adder\n\nHrodkir had not seen these before coming to Elsweyr. He was told they are also found in Hammerfell. Large desert snakes, usually brown scaled, with wings on their backs. They don't fly much. Mostly use wings to scare predators and shade head. They can pounce from great distance, though. Normally wouldn't try to net snake, but wings are easily trapped. Easy to skin and cook. Like scaly, scary hens.\n\nLions\n\nNot all cats in Elsweyr are Khajiit, but more cats are Khajiit than you might expect. This one can't usually tell unless the cat is clothed. Hrodkir suggests not eating cats while in Elsweyr. Khajiit think it in poor taste. Meat is actually tasty, though."

Unfortunately, the adeptorium was overrun by a dozen drooling ogres.\n\n""This isn't good,"" Khunzar-ri said as he watched the gluttonous ogres as they ransacked the premises from a nearby hill. He was particularly concerned when he saw them break into the stores of moon-sugar double rum. He was especially looking forward to the adepts' potent beverage. Then Khunzar-ri had an idea.\n\n""Oh, brave and mighty ogres,"" Khunzar-ri called out. ""Those barrels you found. Can't you tell the rum has spoiled? I can smell that the liquid has gone bad from way over here!""\n\n""Spoiled?"" asked the largest ogre dubiously. ""You can't know that. We haven't even cracked open a barrel yet!""\n\n""Am I not Khajiit?"" Khunzar-ri asked with all sincerity. ""And aren't Khajiit known for their most excellent sense of smell?""\n\n""That is true,"" said another ogre. ""Everyone knows about cats and smell.""\n\n""But I am thirsty!"" complained the largest ogre. ""I do not want to drink spoiled rum!""\n\n""I have a suggestion,"" said Khunzar-ri. ""There is a Nedic fort a short distance from here. They have an entire warehouse full of rum and other spirits, and I did not smell a hint of spoilage when I passed by. To the contrary, it all smelled delicious!""\n\nHappy to hear it, the largest ogre ran toward the Nedic fort, the adepts' rum forgotten. With nary a pause, the other eleven ogres followed.\n\n""Now,"" said Khunzar-ri, ""let us open that barrel and have a drink!""\n\n""What about the ogres?"" asked one of the adepts.\n\n""What about them? They are the Nedes problem now."" And with that Khunzar-ri proceeded to drink the entire barrel, one mug at a time."

msgid "By Infrasia Mallius\n\nOf all the far-flung provinces of this great Empire, none may be quite as welcoming as Elsweyr. Don't let their beastly countenance fool you. The Khajiit are, by and large, a friendly and gracious people, eager to host visitors and entice travelers with all manner of goods and services. If you wish to vacation in a land of carefree ease, gentle breezes, and plentiful warmth, look no further!\n\nShould you travel there from Cyrodiil, you'll enter the venerable province of Anequina—one of the two major regions that make up the province of Elsweyr—and find the pastoral town of Riverhold waiting to welcome you.\n\nThis bustling border town is a frequent stop for caravanners and travelers passing between Elsweyr and the greater Empire. The spacious town square acts as an open-air market where a wide array of goods are peddled right off the wagon by their enterprising owners, and the offerings vary by the hour as traders depart on their journeys or arrive from them. There's plenty to do other than haggle, of course. The Banished Regrets inn frequently offers a selection of imported libations to ease a parched throat and the quiet atmosphere of the Temple of the Moon's Blessing is sure to give you a moment's peace. There is also a burgeoning House of Histories, which promises to exhibit the long and storied history of the Khajiit upon its completion.\n\nOnce you're refreshed and ready to resume your travels, a short caravan ride east of Riverhold will lead you to the capital of Anequina: Rimmen.\n\nOn the road to Rimmen, you'll begin to see that the land of Elsweyr is as diverse as the Khajiit themselves. The closer you draw to the flourishing city, the more apparent it becomes that here the arid savannah has been tamed and the dry grassland has given way to lush greenery and flooded steppes of cane paddies. Within Rimmen's high walls, you will see that the misconception that Khajiit have an aversion to water is greatly exaggerated. Here trees and tropical plants thrive along artificial canals that weave throughout the city, supplied by a great aqueduct that spans the entire kingdom. Older than the city itself, it's a wonder constructed in an era long behind us. Lounging along the waterways is a favorite pass-time for residents and visitors alike. Rimmen's year-round warmth and largely clear skies make it a popular destination for vacationers from all around the Empire. Spend one day here and you'll find that Khajiit hospitality is second to none!\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous and up for a considerable hike, you can while away your time following the Anequina Aqueduct through the countryside. While you're touring the wonders of Anequina, you simply cannot miss the Scar, quite literally, an expansive canyon carved straight through the middle of the region. The sight of it from above or below is breathtaking in its magnitude and one you won't want to miss. Though you may find the sight of a vast water source that's just out of reach too much to bear in the arid scrub-lands that lie to the west.\n\nBefore you endeavor to traverse the winding chasm that is the Scar, it would behoove you to stop by the city of Orcrest. While Riverhold is the gateway to Anequina, and Rimmen the capital, Orcrest is the center of commerce. This ancient, walled city rests along the cliffs of the Scar, outstretching its welcoming arms (its great bridges) to bring the disparate regions of Anequina together. Traders from all over the kingdom, and beyond come here to peddle their goods to their counterparts from neighboring Pellitine, Valenwood, and Cyrodiil. Few things cannot be found for sale here. It's said that Khajiit here will part with their tail for the right price, but I'll admit that my fluency with Ta'agra is not the best.\n\nYou may have tired hustle and bustle of city life, there are plenty of quieter places to take in the scenery. Placid moon-sugar farms dot the meadows of Merryvale, where the cane stalks sway along with the songs of cheery harvesters in the cool breeze. Khajiiti temples to the Divines are both numerous and strikingly beautiful. Sunspire in particular dwarfs any cathedral in Kvatch. Though if you want a truly unique Elsweyr experience, spend some time meditating with the monks of one of their adeptoriums and take in the feats of strength, agility, and skill that these dedicated ascetics are capable of.\n\nIf my words have brought you this far, I hope you'll take a few steps more and begin your travels to one of the most wondrous provinces in the Empire!"

msgid "By Tendwuayne, Sapiarch of Foreign Customs\n\nDespite its status as one of the Elsweyr's most enduring traditions, the origins of Khajiiti martial arts, or ""Claw-Dances,"" remain murky at best. The burning of Corinthe's Grand Archive by Merrunz cultists in 1E 463 destroyed most of the region's Merethic records, making the work of cultural historians like myself very difficult indeed. Luckily, Darloc Brae, the famed conqueror and so-called Golden Beast of Anequina, took great pains to secure what histories remained, placing them in vaults and smaller archives throughout Elsweyr. Gaining access to these archives is no small feat for a High Elf, I can tell you. But years of dogged persistence have borne some meager fruits.\n\nFrom what I can ascertain, life in Merethic Era Elsweyr was a toilsome affair. At that time, the famed sixteen kingdoms of the Khajiit were little more than competing fiefdoms, ruled by a cruel hunter-aristocracy. Severe droughts and periods of famine struck Anequina with pitiless regularity, and the constant feuding of the hunter-nobles resulted in widespread military conscription—robbing peasant communities of youthful labor and prompting still greater famine across the region. The only check placed on the hunt-lords resided in the Temples of Two-Moons Dance. Khajiiti adepts and other Torval clergy wielded significant cultural influence, and occasionally used it to vex or even overthrow particularly vicious hunt-lords. The aristocracy chafed at these intrusions, but knew better than to challenge the adepts directly.\n\nAt some point in the high days of the Merethic Era, a particularly ruthless hunt-lord named Takanzin the Striped Death paid a flock of criminals to set fire to the Rawl'kha Temple. The clergy displaced by the blaze immediately fielded a small army of warrior-adepts to punish those responsible. The details of the conflict are lost to the ages, but the resolution was quite clear: Takanzin's forces quashed the priestly uprising and drove the remaining adepts out of the Kingdom of Dune altogether.\n\nSeizing the opportunity to be done with the adepts' meddling once and for all, the other hunt-lords across the northern tier of what is now Elsweyr instituted a policy of weapon confiscation. They cited the violence in Rawl'kha as evidence of the clergy's treasonous intentions and brutally suppressed any religious order that refused to comply.\n\nAfter an extended period of deep despondency and contemplation, the adepts turned inward—cutting ties with the politics of the age and focusing entirely on self-perfection. Religious meditation was an essential part of that journey.\n\nIn many cultures, meditation is a quiet and motionless activity. Not so for Khajiit. Their nervous energy and focus on raw physicality drove them to adopt a lyrical, dance-like form of meditation. It couldn't have taken long for the adepts' dancing to transform into something akin to a martial art. Smooth, meditative dance gave way to swift claw-strikes and daring leaps. This should come as no surprise, given the Khajiits' predatory instincts. People possessing claws and fangs cannot be expected to remain peaceful forever!\n\nAfter centuries of isolation, the adepts emerged from their cloisters, bristling with martial skill and wisdom. By this point, the hunter-aristocracy was nearing its end. Disparities in wealth and influence had reached a tipping point, paving the way for a long-overdue public uprising. The adepts wasted no time sharing their hard-earned skills with the beleaguered peasantry. Within the span of a few generations, the adepts' martial arts were completely ubiquitous. All the people needed was a spark.\n\nIn the latter days of the Merethic Era, feuding hunt-lords from Meirvale and Helkarn drafted thousands of peasants into military service, bringing about one of the worst famines in Elsweyr's history. After three years of futile conflict, the armies of both lords turned on their masters, toppling the aristocracy in a rain of slashing claws, wind-kicks, and bone-breaking punches.\n\nBefore long, peasant uprisings broke out in nearby Riverhold, Orcrest, Verkarth, Bruk'ra, and Ne Quin-al. Within a century, the regal hunter caste that had reigned over Elsweyr for thousands of years fell from power.\n\nWe know that the glorious dream of a farming utopia never took hold in Elsweyr. Within a few hundred years, a new brand of landed nobility ascended to the thrones of the sixteen kingdoms. But the people have never forgotten the power they wield. Despite the lack of written records, the rich oral traditions of the Khajiiti clan mothers ensure that the Cat-Folk never forget their struggles and triumphs.\n\nI remain an outsider here, but I cannot help but think that we approach a new tipping point in Elsweyr. The Imperial, Euraxia Tharn, is not so very different from the hunt-lords of millennia past. And if she does not learn from her missteps, she may well share their fate."

msgid "As Transcribed By Tiburr, Record Keeper of the Rimmen Mage's Guild\n\n[Transcriber's Note: Tales of the Angry Alfiq have a long tradition in Khajiiti storytelling. No one knows quite how many tales there are in total, given that storytellers are constantly adding to the collection. Aside from the titular character, commonalities of these stories include their short length, non-sequitur nature, and humorous endings.\n\nTo the bafflement of some, these stories are not meant to teach moral lessons or cultural values, as many folktales do. Rather, the adventures of the Angry Alfiq are more akin to elaborate jokes. So, as is the Khajiiti tradition, open your ears and prepare to laugh as I tell you some of the most popular Angry Alfiq stories to date.]\n\n* * *\n\nThe Angry Alfiq and the Senche\n\nOne day the Angry Alfiq met a very pretty Senche. She was more beautiful than any Khajiit of any furstock he had seen before. Right at that moment, he knew that he would do anything to win her affection.\n\n""You are too meek!"" laughed his Suthay cousin. ""How will you woo her?""\n\n""You are too weak!"" laughed his Cathay sister. ""She will crush you!""\n\n""You are too small!"" laughed his Pahmar brother. ""How will you reach her?""\n\nBut the Angry Alfiq was determined to win the pretty Senche's love. He trained day and night to become strong. He read many books on romance and affection. He bought four boots, each with very thick heels. And with these preparations done, he went off to win the heart of his lady love.\n\nHe returned the next morning with a broken heart and a broken hip.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Angry Alfiq and the Lute\n\nOne day the Angry Alfiq met a traveling bard. She played and sung more beautifully than any bard he had heard before. Right at that moment, he knew that he would do anything to play music by her side.\n\n""You could play the tambourine,"" said the bard. ""Just shake it with your mouth!""\n\nBut the Angry Alfiq did not want to play the tambourine.\n\n""You could play the drum,"" said the bard. ""Just bat it with your paw!""\n\nBut the Angry Alfiq did not want to play the drum.\n\n""Well, what other instrument could you play with a body such as yours?"" asked the bard.\n\nThe Angry Alfiq answered that he wished to play the lute, for it was the most elegant and sweet-sounding instrument of all. \n\nThe bard just laughed. She could not imagine how one so little and with such clumsy paws would be able to play a lute. It was impossible, simply impossible!\n\nBut the more she laughed, the more determined the Angry Alfiq was to prove her wrong. He demanded that the bard hand over her own lute so that he may try to play. Amused, the bard obliged.\n\nThe Angry Alfiq popped out a single, sharp claw with a smirk. In one quick stroke, he strummed it across every single string, cleaning slicing each and every one.\n\nAnd then it was the Angry Alfiq who laughed and laughed as he ran down the street, the enraged bard not very far behind.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Angry Alfiq and the Beard\n\nOne day the Angry Alfiq saw the largest, bushiest beard he had ever seen. It was thick and black, reaching all the way down to the stomach of Khajiit who grew it. Right at that moment, he knew that he would do anything to have such a magnificent beard.\n\nBut try and try as he might, the Angry Alfiq could grow no more than the scruff of fur already adorning his chin. He tried many tonics and even spells, but nothing seemed to work.\n\n""This one will help!"" said his Suthay cousin. ""But you must pay gold, even though we are family.""\n\nThe Angry Alfiq agreed to these terms and his Suthay cousin went to work. Using tar to make them stick, the cousin placed feather upon feather on the Angry Alfiq's chin. When at last she was done, she pulled a mirror from her pack.\n\nThe Angry Alfiq hissed in anger, swiping his sharp claws across his Suthay cousin's sensitive nose. As she cried and cried, he took all her gold along with his own and left her household in a huff.\n\n""This one will help!"" said his Cathay sister. ""But still you must pay, even though we are siblings.""\n\nOnce again, the Angry Alfiq agreed to these terms. Using honey this time, the sister placed clump after clump of cotton on his chin. When at last she was done, she picked him up and let him peer into the mirror on her wall.\n\nThe Angry Alfiq yowled in anger, swiping his sharp claws across his Cathay sister's hand. As she cried and cried, he took all her gold along with his own and left her room in a huff.\n\n""I will help!"" said his Pahmar brother. ""But if I succeed, you must give me all the gold you now have.""\n\nHesitantly, the Angry Alfiq agreed. And so his Pahmar brother went to the bearded stranger and knocked him out, allowing the brother to deftly cut off every hair from the stranger's chin. He presented this large tuft of hair to the Angry Alfiq with a toothy grin.\n\nThe Angry Alfiq growled and growled, but still he gave up his gold, for it was true that his Pahmar brother had gifted him with a mighty fine beard."

The eldest, who by the dutiful teachings of his master and the savagery of time had grown wretched and wise, went to the banks of the Darkarn River to fashion a litter of reeds. \n\nThe eldest bore the Sage of White Sand up the steps of the Dancing Moon Temple, and as he did so the brothers and sisters of our order followed. They burned moonlight in their censers. Fume and chanting wreathed the stone and sand and bodies. When the eldest had borne him to the mountaintop, to the vault where Anequina Sharp-Tongue had danced the last Dance of Shadows, the chanting stopped. The smoke of moonlight poured from our censers and the room was shrouded in silent gloam.\n\nJuha-ri, who was made lame through his long years of devotion, stood and tottered before the eldest on unsteady paws. He asked if the eldest recalled what brought him to the Dancing Shadow Temple all those years before. And the eldest nodded, for he had studied the sutras and knew that years were as brief as a single flap of a fletcherfly's wings in winter. \n\nAnd returning the eldest's nod with his own, Juha-ri stood perfectly still. In the soul of the Sage of White Sand the eldest saw movement, chaotic and beautiful. It echoed through the lattice, swelling with reverberation off the fumes of moonlight and the great and small vertices. As the fuming moonlight burned his lungs, the eldest saw the Dance of Shadows was no demand nor supplication. It was an existence, nearly close to perfection. The lattice mirrored and perfected the form, and in doing so was changed, for a time.\n\nAnd as it started, so did the Dance of Shadows end. Juha-ri collapsed, his soul gone to the Sand Behind the Stars. The eldest heeded the lesson well."

In its myriad contortions and rhythms was found the bastion of existence such that could not be found elsewhere.\n\nThey returned to the temple, bodies caked in sweat, mouths tasting of lingering sweetness.

He thanked the great Sage of White Sand for his words and began his long walk home.\n\nJuha-ri called to the young one, and though the Sage of White Sand spoke only the barest whisper the wind carried the voice as though it had descended from Jone and Jode themselves. Juha-ri offered to share with the youth his knowledge of the Dance. The young one was confused. No serpent could be instructed to walk. No owl can make fire. Were these not likened to teaching the Dance of Shadows?\n\nThe Sage of White Sand nodded. A serpent will always be a serpent, an owl always an owl. But the soul may become many things, though it may take lifetimes to become them. Many consider such a price too dear to pay, and they will never come to know the Dance of Shadows. \n\nThe youth nodded and stood in contemplation.

Failure to pass this last trial would result in a grave punishment. Perhaps even her death.\n\nShe thought of all of her options. Was there was a priest could protect her from the spirits? A potion that would let her stay awake forever? But the more she thought, the less realistic each idea became.\n\nSo afraid was Kail-Perwa, she did not fall asleep until well until the night.\n\nShe awoke into a dream once more.

""But you have yet to pass mine. Do you accept my judgment, descendant?""\n\nKail-Perwa nodded quickly, just once. She knew it would be useless to object.\n\n""You have proven to be clever twice through your actions,"" continued the warrior in gold as he slung his mighty sword across his shoulders. ""But how clever are your words? This will be your last trial, Kail-Perwa. Convince me that you are more clever than all living and all dead.""\n\nFor the first time in her life, Kail-Perwa did not know what to say. What words could she weave to convince this spirit of such cleverness?\n\n""To go forward, sometimes you must look back,"" the woman in red had told her.\n\n""Seek what is true, not what is obvious,"" the grandfather in blue had said.\n\nKail-Perwa closed her eyes and thought. She had overcome two trials to prove herself more clever than any other. But was that truly the purpose of her hardships? Using all of her cleverness, using all of her wit, she thought about what she had learned and what she must do.\n\nWhen next her eyes opened, Kail-Perwa knew she had found the truth.\n\n""I can't,"" she told the warrior in gold, her hands trembling slightly. ""I can't convince you that I'm more clever than all living and all dead.""\n\n""Oh?"" asked the warrior in gold, his voice even. ""And why is that?""\n\n""Because I'm not,"" answered Kail-Perwa. ""If I was truly so clever, I would never make such a boast. There are many I have never met, and many I will never meet. And to condemn them to be less clever than I is foolishness.""\n\n""I see,"" said the warrior in gold, his face revealing nothing. ""And is this all you have to say?""\n\nKail-Perwa bowed deeply, her head hung in shame. ""I know now that such boasts are an insult our family's good name. I apologize.""\n\nAnd with this, the warrior's face broke into a grin. His armor transformed into noble robes, his face growing a long, full beard. And that was when Kali-Perwa realized that the spirit before her was none other than General Haro-Banar, the most honored of her ancestors.\n\n""You have humbled yourself before me, despite risk of punishment,"" said General Haro-Banar. ""And for that, I will forgive your transgressions. Live modestly, my descendant, for there are none so clever as those who realize their own limitations.""\n\n""Thank you, General Haro-Banar,"" said Kail-Perwa, her heart filled with gratitude. ""That is a lesson I shall never forget.""\n\nAnd so Kail-Perwa finally awoke to the wisdom of her ancestors, and all was well."

After all, there was none so clever as she! Why concern herself about a punishment that would never come to pass?\n\nThere were just two more trials left. If Kail-Perwa succeeded in both, and she was confident that she would, her boast would become a proven truth! Perhaps her ancestors would even reward her for such a victory.\n\nKail-Perwa found it easy to fall asleep that night.\n\nJust as before, she entered into a dream. Again, the land around her was covered in a thin layer of water, cold against her feet. Again, the sky above was an endless white. But this time there was no black tree or woman in read. Instead, there was black table with two black chairs. Seated at one of the chairs was an elderly man dressed in blue.\n\nKail-Perwa bowed to the ancestral spirit and politely said, ""Greetings, grandfather.""\n\n""Ah, Kail-Perwa. You have come at last to meet this old man,"" the grandfather in blue greeted. ""Please, have a seat so we may begin your trial.""\n\nWith only a moment's hesitation, Kail-Perwa did as she was bid. She found no trickery in her steps this time, and easily found her way to the table where she took a seat.\n\n""Now, as for your trial,"" the grandfather continued, ""It is very simple. We will play a single game of tihasae. Your only goal is to stop my victory. Do you understand?""\n\nKail-Perwa nodded, though her stomach clenched. She had played tihasae many times, this was true. It was a game which required great cunning to win, and Kail-Perwa won it often. But could she prevail against this elderly spirit, who had both wisdom and cunning on his side?\n\nWith a swipe of his hand, the grandfather in blue summoned a tihasae board. The game pieces were bone white, contrasting against the dark browns of the board. He gestured towards Kail-Perwa, inviting her to take the first move. And so the game began.\n\nIt was not an easy battle. Kail-Perwa's hands shook as she moved her pieces across the board. Every time she went in for an attack, the grandpa in blue was there with a impassable defense. And when he struck her pieces, he struck mercilessly. Quickly, quicker than Kail-Perwa thought possible, she was on the verge of defeat.\n\nAt last, Kail-Perwa found herself one turn from losing. There was no way she could win, no way she could even escape defeat. This, she was clever enough to see.\n\nBut must she win? Suddenly, Kail-Perwa's eyes opened wide. The grandfather in blue said to stop his victory. If this was truly a simple task, did she truly need to win against him?\n\nWithout another thought, Kail-Perwa swiped her hand across the board. The tihasae pieces scattered into the water with soft plops, sinking further and further than should have been possible. With that simple action, there was no way for the game to conclude. There was no way for either competitor to win.\n\nThe grandfather in blue chuckled and said, ""Very good, Kail-Perwa. With one move, you have stopped my victory. Simple, was it not?""\n\nKail-Perwa panted, her breaths ragged and short. She had nearly failed the trial, and it was very possible that such a failure could have resulted in her death.\n\n""And now a lesson for you,"" the grandfather in blue continued, nodding his head. ""Seek what is true, not what is obvious. Let this lesson be your guiding words, for there is still one trial ahead.""\n\nAnd with that, Kail-Perwa awoke to the morning sun."

msgid "As Retold by Nalae-Polek, Poet Laureate to Potentate Versidue-Shaie\n\nKail-Perwa found it very difficult to sleep that night. The warrior in gold had claimed that she would be visited by three of her cleverest ancestors. Should Kail-Perwa fail to prove her wit to all three of them, she would be punished. But how would she be punished?\n\nKail-Perwa was clever enough to know that the warrior in gold who visited her was an ancestral spirit. As such, the spirit had the power to grant her both great fortune or misfortune, depending on his ruling. He could even drag Kail-Perwa to the afterlife, should he be truly angered.\n\nWould she be able to pass these three trials? Would she be killed if she failed? Such questions kept Kail-Perwa awake late into the night, until at last she fell asleep.\n\nWhen Kail-Perwa next awakened, she was not truly awake. She was inside a dream, of this she was sure, but her consciousness had never been so clear and aware in a dream as it was now. Truly, it felt like she had been transported into another realm.\n\nAnd what a strange realm it was. The land around her was covered in a thin layer of water, cold against her feet. The sky above was an endless white. The only distinguishing feature was a twisted, black tree, jutting out from the water. And next to this tree was a lone woman, dressed in red.\n\nKail-Perwa instantly knew this was the first spirit to would judge her.\n\nThe woman in red smiled. She was young and beautiful with a noble bearing, and when she spoke, her voice was like the wind which foretells a great storm.\n\n""I have come to judge you,"" said the woman in red, ""for you have claimed to be more clever than I. As your ancestor, I bear right to test that cleverness. Do you accept my judgement?""\n\nKail-Perwa bowed deeply and said, ""I do.""\n\n""My task is simple, then. You must walk to me. This is all.""\n\nKail-Perwa worried her lip, for she doubted the task was as simple as the woman in red declared. Still, the only action she could take was to move forward. But as Kail-Perwa walked, she quickly found herself moving further and further away. It was if the tree and the woman in red leaned away from her, just as swiftly as she walked forward.\n\n""All is not as it seems,"" thought Kail-Perwa. ""There is a trick to this place that I have yet to see.""\n\nSo she looked behind her, and saw but endless water. She looked above, and saw but endless sky. But then she looked below, and saw her own reflection. And this reflection, as impossible as it may have been, was facing away from the woman in red.\n\nKail-Perwa could almost laugh! What a simple trick. As she moved forward, her reflection was moving her away from the woman in red. In order to walk towards the spirit, she must move her reflection in the correct direction, not herself.\n\nAnd so Kail-Perwa turned away from the woman in red and began to walk. It was an odd sensation, as her steps seemed to pull the land ahead of her further away. Very quickly, she heard a tinkling laugh near her ear. She turned around, now face to face with the mysterious spirit.\n\nThe woman in red smiled and said, ""Very good, Kail-Perwa. You have solved my task. But tell me, do you realize the lesson learned?""\n\nKail-Perwa bit her lip and shook her head, for she did not know.\n\n""To go forward, sometimes you must go back,"" the woman in red gently explained. ""Let this lesson be your guiding words, for there are still two trials ahead.""\n\nAnd with that, Kail-Perwa awoke to the morning sun."

msgid "A Study in Akaviri Mystique\nBy Magnate Feina-Darak\n\nWhen the Khajiit and Rim-Men of Northern Elsweyr granted asylum to the Akaviri refugees of the fading Potentate, the first of the arrivals were bequeathed the unused crypts west of the capital. In these, they would bury the dead that did not survive the flight from the Imperial City.\n\nThe monarchs of the region, King Savlian of Rimmen and Queen Padala of the Anequina Khajiit, decreed that the Akaviri survivors would be resettled within the capital and the fertile hills to the south. They brought with them many of their retainers, full-blooded Imperials who were nevertheless devoted to their former rulers.\n\nThough Rimmen already had an eclectic society as a crossroads of Imperial and Khajiiti trade, the strange aesthetics, culture, and even food of the Akaviri settlers changed the city forever. The most unusual contribution of the Akaviri, if one can call it that, was the construction of the Tonenaka Shrine in the northern district of Rimmen.\n\nBuilt with Khajiiti stonework influenced by Akaviri architectural styles, the Tonenaka Shrine became something of a cultural touchstone for the remaining Akaviri settlers and their former Imperial subjects. Their patriarchs commissioned the construction of ten thousand statuettes of carved stone, bringing sculptors and engineers from across southern Tamriel to aid in the project.\n\nIndeed, the vast wealth that these Akaviri settlers brought with them to finance the project greatly increased Rimmen's prosperity. However, as the years passed, so few of the Akaviri remained that only five lived to see the Shrine's completion. Most had interbred with the Imperial population or settled farther south in the village of Hakoshae.\n\nWhen the final statue was placed, these five Akaviri entered the Tonenaka Shrine and sealed its doors behind them, placing powerful wards upon it to prevent entry. This wasn't part of the original agreement between the Rimmen authorities and the Akaviri builders, but with the promise of gold their ire was assuaged.\n\nThe Shrine remains sealed to this day, with only occasional work being done to its exterior to prevent degradation of its marvelous stonework."

She was known to spin words the way a spider spins its web, alluring and beautiful. But this clever tongue came with a boastful mouth.\n\n""Living or dead, there are none in Akavir who can match my wit!"" Kail-Perwa proclaimed one day. \n\nThough her parents tried to silence her, Kail-Perwa would not take back her words. She repeated them one, twice, thrice. And on that third time, her words were so sure and loud that they echoed all the way into the afterlife.\n\n""There are none so clever as I!""\n\nThough all of Kail-Perwa's ancestors were displeased with her words, one spirit in particular took great offense. It was the spirit of General Haro-Banar, a man who had won many great victories with his cleverness. The general had always been modest about his accomplishments, and was displeased that his descendant did not follow this example.\n\n""Kail-Perwa claims to be more clever than all, living and dead,"" the general proclaimed. ""I shall travel to the world of the living and see if these boastful words hold any truth.""\n\nGeneral Haro-Banar was well-honored by the living, and so his spirit was strong enough to leave the afterlife and venture into the mortal realm. He did so now, changing his ghostly appearance into that of a warrior dressed in golden armor. Swift as the wind, he traveled to Kail-Perwa's village and sought her out.\n\nThe general found Kail-Perwa in the edge of the village, collecting herbs for her house. For a moment he hesitated, for the general knew his descendant to be as dutiful as she was clever. And so he resolved to give her one last chance to renounce her boastful ways and live modestly.\n\n""I seek Kail-Perwa,"" said General Haro-Banar, making his presence known. ""Be you her?\n\nKail-Perwa looked up and nodded, wiping the dirt from the palm of her hands. ""Yes, I am she.""\n\n""It is said that you claim to be more clever than any living or any dead. Be this true?""\n\nKail-Perwa stood to her full height and gave the general a confident smile. ""Yes, it is true. There is none so clever as I.""\n\n""That is quite the claim to make,"" replied the general, his voice growing cold. ""After all, how can you prove yourself against the dead?""\n\nKail-Perwa shrugged. ""Should any of the dead take offense from my words, let them prove themselves to me! After all, cannot spirits visit the land of the living?""\n\n""Very well,"" said the general with a solemn nod. ""For the next three nights, you will be visited by the cleverest of your ancestors. Prove yourself to them, and your boast will become truth.""\n\nSuddenly, Kail-Perwa was afraid. How could this stranger make such a claim?\n\n""Who are you?"" she asked, her voice trembling.\n\n""I am he who will meet you on the third night,"" said General Haro-Banar, his voice mighty, his gaze unflinching. ""I am he who will acknowledge you as cleverest of all, should you prove yourself so. And I am he who will punish you, should your boasts be but clever lies.""\n\nAnd with that, he was gone."

msgid "By Dardarfin\n\nI've been given the unique and amazing opportunity to visit the more remote areas of Northern Elsweyr in search of the elusive and dangerous terror bird! Known locally as the khrasaat, these huge, flightless, carnivorous birds tend to be incredibly aggressive, and are both intelligent and beautiful to behold. I plan to get as close to one as possible. \n\nLone Khajiit warriors often hunt these animals to prove their own ferocity, but they die almost as often as they emerge victorious. These predators definitely should not be trifled with, so I'll have to be extremely careful when I approach one.\n\n* * *\nI tracked a young male terror bird through the dense Tenmar jungle and have been observing him all evening. What a majestic creature! Easily taller than the biggest Orc or Nord I ever encountered, he must weigh ten times as much as old Dardarfin! If only you could see him, his feathers fluffed and wings spread! His long, arching neck swaying side to side, those dark, beady eyes glinting in the moonlight. Could he be strutting for a mate? Has he detected me and sending a warning?\n\n* * *\nWhew that was a close call! It's a good thing these amazing birds are flightless and can't climb trees or I would have been a goner for sure! So it was not a warning at all, but a signal. No sooner had I decided to step a little closer than I was suddenly surrounded by three more terror birds! He wasn't alone after all, but acting as a scout for his pack. Truly remarkable! What intelligence these creatures possess!\n\nThe terror birds are well suited for skulking in shadows. Their feathers appear as a very dark blue or dusty black, with a striking shock of red on their throats, like a bib of blood. It makes for a terrifying sight! While they had me trapped I saw one of them run down a senche, felling it with a powerful kick. Then it brought that hook-like beak down with such force it broke right through flesh and bone. Definitely not something I could learn from a High-Elf zoo. They told me that terror birds eat moon-sugar plants. Not true! These are blood-thirsty carnivores!\n\nThroughout the night I saw this pack attack everything that came near. I figured something was amiss when they killed an antelope as a group and did not eat it. There must be a nest nearby, so it's time to get a closer look. Don't try this at home, it's extremely dangerous! \n\n* * *\nThat was frightening! I'm inside a small cave near the pack's hunting grounds, and there is a nest here constructed of branches, torn fabric, and feathers. Very intricate construction for a pack of mindless birds. A few eggs occupy the nest as well. They look like dark onyx ovals with veins of blue, each about the size of my head. Very lovely, indeed. Don't want to touch these beauties, though, or my scent could make the parents reject or even destroy the egg. I've seen such behavior in other species. Unfortunately, one of the females has returned, so I'm stuck in this crevice for the time being.\n\n* * *\nThese magnificent birds do not see well at night, so I took the opportunity when darkness fell  to make my escape. It was a good thing, too, because even more of the pack arrived right after that. Terror birds appear communal in nature when it comes to caring for their young. \n\nIt's time I made my way back to civilization. Poachers have come to Elsweyr and would hunt these magnificent creatures for sport. I hope that you, my readers, will join me in voicing your opposition to this kind of activity. Animals deserve our respect and should be preserved, not murdered for entertainment or out of fear. They are a valuable part of this environment and it would be a shame for these incredible creatures to disappear."

msgid "By Cornelius Clanius, Agent-Inspector of the Imperial Trade Service\n\nMoon-sugar! It's become more prevalent since the Dragonstar Caravan Company began exporting it and the cats claiming it's a sacred but harmless cooking ingredient. Yet have you seen what happens to those who sprinkle it on their vegetables? They get excitable! And lethargic! Sometimes at once! The cats are out to corrupt our youth with their sweet, poisonous 'sugar' I tell you. It is a substance that must be banned from the Empire at once, for the good of the children!\n\nHowever, I don't expect the Service to simply take my word for it, so the ever-vigilant Cornelius Clanius has taken it upon himself to travel to Elsweyr and expose the truth.\n\nThe first impression of moon-sugar leaves little to be desired. It is a grainy, powdery, crystal-like substance. Each 'piece' ranges in size from a grain of rice to the size of one's thumb, and can be crushed or liquefied for use in cooking. It has a white-to-silver sheen and despite being similar in appearance to salt crystals, it is not translucent. Instead, when light hits a solid fragment of moon-sugar, it seems to glow from within. \n\nWhile obviously merely refracted light, this may be responsible for the cultural belief that moon-sugar consists of crystallized moonlight. Many Khajiit believe that it is a gift from their gods. One popular tale speaks of Azurah, their so-called 'Sugar God', whom brought the light of the moons down to the marshes where it became sugar. Such primitive beliefs are easily disproved with a little alchemy, but this is not one of yours truly's talents.\n\nVenturing into the many small adeptoriums that dot Elsweyr's landscape, one can find moon-sugar in use with various ceremonies. It is accepted in these places that by consuming moon-sugar, they are imbibing portions of their gods' souls. Many believe it can be used to grant visions when consumed in various concoctions and combined with meditation. \n\nThey state it can grant a state of enlightenment, but there is a more terrible truth to this. These adeptoriums sometimes make use of skooma, which they themselves refine from moon-sugar. The Moon-Bishops claim that only they use it and it is never distributed, Cornelius Clanius was not born yesterday! These babbling 'wisemen' claim to have visions granted through the use of the drug. Could you imagine if that idea came into fashion within the Empire? \n\nDid Cornelius Clanius, Agent-Inspector for the Imperial Trade Service ever imbibe some of this moon-sugar, you ask? Did he even try it, to see if it is as terrible as he seems to claim? Yes, he did and this is why he so fervently suggests banning it! You see, the Khajiit put moon-sugar in everything and eat it daily. They claim it's because they have a sweet tooth and this satisfies their cravings. Poppycock! They're all drug addicts, that's why. The more they use it, the more calloused they become to its effects. We humans however? We are not calloused. We are susceptible to our basest urges! \n\nWhen this devout and intent Agent ate some of this moon-sugar, do you know what happened? He began to laugh hysterically! Such energy! Such enthusiasm! Your very structured and precise Cornelius went out and hugged a lamp post! Every claw mark was a fascinating discovery. The very texture was enrapturing and I told everyone I came across about it. Imagine our youth, sitting about, fondling inanimate objects! This is the future the Khajiit want. It will cripple the Empire and pave the way for its inevitable collapse. \n\nIf it remains on the streets, we will have an entire generation of degenerates who sit around, eating sweets, and discussing their feelings in public. This is to say nothing of the lethargy that follows! No wonder the Khajiit are lazy. Once this horrific sugar runs its course, it leaves one drained and exhausted. It is simply not compatible with the Imperial work ethic. \n\nNo. This moon-sugar must be declared illegal at once. \n\nYour faithful and dedicated Agent-Inspector, \nCornelius Clanius"

msgid "By Sulema, Initiate Scholar of the Pa'alatiin\n\nWith respect to my mentors, who taught me to question everything. May we forever approach lore with raised fur and unsheathed claws.\n\nMuch of what scholars take to be true about Elsweyr is filtered through the bias and perceptions of those of Cyrodiil and other non-Khajiit loremasters and scholars. In fact, the geopolitical entities (which were originally Khajiiti clan names) of Ne Quin-al and Pa'alatiin are more commonly known as Anequina and Pellitine, respectively, due to the prevalence of Cyrodilic-based studies, the demotion of importance of native lore by non-Khajiit scholars, and the loss of native-based information. For a people who started out as nomadic clans with static locations only for trade and other social activities, attaching tribal names to locations as if these regions always existed is problematic because it implies ownership over certain terrain when, in fact, the clans originally moved as they needed to across the province now called Elsweyr. Some would note that the names Ne Quin-al and Pa'alatiin are Ta'agra, and while that is an acceptable observation, this one feels it is more accurate to use these names for the people and the Cyrodilic names of Anequina and Pellitine for their respective regions.\n\nInitially, a single Khajiiti Moon-Emperor ruled the region, and he later gave rise to the famous and esteemed Darloc Brae in 1E 461. During these days, sixteen Khajiiti clans roamed the province, and each performed a function. For example, the Ne Quin-al consisted of warriors and trained their members in martial disciplines and battle tactics. Some say that even then these clans belonged to regions or realms, but that is an oversimplification. Khajiit went where they were needed and wanted (or where they wanted to be), more or less. For reference, please examine the lullaby ""Hasa Zha'ja"" or ""The Name Dance,"" wherein the first known story of how the clans earned their names exists.\n\nAs the clans mastered their areas of expertise and as outside pressures started pushing them into roles and more limited geographical areas, the concept of tribal regions coalesced somewhat even within the Khajiiti way of thinking. Thus it becomes more accurate to call both the people and the area Ne Quin-al, but only ""more accurate"" — not completely accurate. The poem ""Zhan Zhab"" (""Wind Game""), written by a clanless Khajiit in 1E 2243, shows the transition from clan name to place name as it unfolds, but questions the need for this even as the language shifts within the poem.\n\nThen came the Thrassian Plague in 1E 2260. Due to the sheer number of deaths, tribal function changed lest the Khajiit die out completely due to starvation and other hardships. Sixteen clans became two and separated in ideology as well as into geographical areas. Those of the Ne Quin'al continued to roam and follow tribal customs, and they did so primarily in the arid northern region. Those of the Pa'alatiin stayed in greener, southern region and took on customs from other lands, especially Breton and Cyrodiil, forming political and social structures that closer emulated those peoples.\n\nAll of the above provides context for the differences between the Khajiit of Anequina and Pellitine. As those of Anequina continued to follow their tribal traditions in the harsher climes of the north, they looked to the south and saw only laziness, corruption, and weakness. By following the ways of others and abandoning their traditions, the southern Khajiit proved to the north just how weak-minded and feeble-bodied they had become. As for the Pellitine Khajiit, they looked to the north and saw only parched landscapes filled with militaristic barbarians. Rule through might alone was frowned upon by these southerners, and though permanent structures existed in Anequina, the fact that many still followed the paths of homeless nomads only underscored to Pellitine just how unenlightened the northern Khajiit were.\n\nTime passed, and the division between the northern and southern Khajiit grew. It took an act of marriage to start healing this rift. In 2E 309, rulers Keirgo of Anequina and Eshita of Pellitine married, creating the current province of Elsweyr. Though both peoples felt betrayed at this alliance, railing at the fact that they were now tied to the fortunes of those who seemingly did not share their values, the breach began to mend somewhat at first. Then, the first blows to the province struck: the assassination of Potentate Versidue-Shaie in Senchal in 2E 324, then the sacking of Ne Quin-al and the resulting slaughter of most of the royal dynasty in 2E 326 by Khajiiti rebels. Both these events weakened the fabric of Elsweyr's political structure, creating an opening for further instability to come. See, for further reference, the transcribed oral history of the period entitled ""Zha'javan Ka'achin"" or ""The Dance of Dual Lands.""\n\nPerhaps the inherent nature of the Khajiit prevented an immediate collapse of the government. Both those in Anequina and those in Pellitine tend toward independent thinking and adaptability, which makes it harder to completely prevail over them for any amount of time.\n\nBut, illness comes to us all, and when the Knahaten Flu struck 2E 565, it further damaged the shaky structure that was the Elsweyr government, creating an opening for the takeover of the city-state of Rimmen and the events that followed."

When the Night Mother called Nazala to her service, she had left this place full of disease, death, and fetid waste. Now she returns to complete a contract as old as her absence here. It is possible the target is already dead, but the Sacrament must have an end, and so Nazala must find him.\n\nThis one begins her search at the Ashen Scar, one of the many mass burial grounds in Elsweyr. When the flu hit, this one saw them being filled. What many call the Ashen Scar is the first of those. It is strong in spiritual power, even one so base as Nazala can feel it. Her target came here looking for something, but doubtful it was what he found. Undead lurk behind every crumbling ruin, dangerous even for one who walks in shadow as this one does. \n\nThis one found no evidence that her target was among those buried here, so she must look further. \n\nHer trail leads south, to a place of stone spires and rickety wooden bridges locals call the Stitches. It was always a place for the less fortunate, the undeserving, and the lawless to find refuge. Nazala first dragged her claws through blood in this place. She remembers a little cub who said he would change things. He would bring hope to this place. Nazala hears that he did for a time, but now he is gone, like the dream he once carried.\n\nThis one's target was not here, but she has found those who remember him. He traveled south, alone, with a caravan of nomads trying to escape the flu. Nazala follows.\n\nCicatrice was once home to a small town along the road from Orcrest to western Elsweyr. Nomads would stop for food and to tell stories. It was a place of rest and warmth and laughter, but the Knahaten Flu destroyed all that. This one has heard rumors that the inhabitants of this place followed an Argonian into an oasis, hoping for help. Nazala found only a cave full of poison and evidence that her quarry left on his own again.\n\nThis time he was sick and heading north, to where the scars weep. She knows where that is, but is afraid of what she will find there.\n\nWhen this one's fur was darker and her claws sharper, she heard tales of the Weeping Scar. There were Khajiit who went down into the dark to feed an addiction of pleasure and blood. Most came back, only to descend once more into the dark. Some, however, stayed. \n\nNazala's target stayed. She followed him into the dark, where her childish fears manifested into those with fangs and a thirst for blood. They did not attack, though things seemed strained, different. There is a feud going on that this one has no interest in joining. She seeks only her target and these phantoms of her youth provided.\n\nInfected with the flu, he came to the vampires of the Scar and hoped for everlasting life. He wished to destroy one infection with another, and traded the darkness of death for another type of darkness. It did not work, and Nazala's target passed into the Moon's light.\n\nThis Khajiit once terrorized a mate and her cub. The skooma and poverty drove him to anger and that anger drove his mate to commit the Sacrament. That cub came here to fulfill her mother's wish, but discovered that her father found his own darkness. \n\nShe says goodbye now, the Sacrament satisfied and a daughter left without a need to remain. The Night Mother still softly calls and Nazala answers."

msgid "By Saharrzag\n\nScribe: Chirrzari\n\nAcknowledgments: My gratitude goes out to every single person who did not understand that I was and AM an intelligent being. For you, and others like you, I have had this pamphlet created. You know who you are. And if you don't after reading this and we meet, we'll have, at the very least, words. Also, thanks go to my scribe. I'm allowing her to keep her annotations within this pamphlet.\n\nLong have the Senche-raht existed, and long have we served both ourselves and others in the role of protectors and defenders. Our form, being muscular and four-legged, is perfect for solo and partnered combat. When not paired with a partner, we can bound forth in great leaps to claw and bite at any who seek to harm us. A trained battle companion—and please mentally add an emphasis on ""trained""—can help us become an even deadlier threat on the field of combat. Whether they're experienced in blade, staff, magic, or bow tactics, when paired with us they gain great mobility on the field, while we take advantage of any attacks they make. We watch for threats to the other, making it harder to bring either of us down, as well.\n\nThe above sounds like it would appeal to bloodthirsty individuals seeking better weapons and tactics on the field. Our abilities in combat are no secret.\n\n[Scribe's note: This one has seen Senche-raht in combat. They are a ragestorm of claws and teeth. One should not wish to make enemies of such beings.]\n\nBut here's my message to those who think they can enthrall Senche-raht and use them against their free will.\n\nDon't.\n\nSome have tried before. It might seem like it's working for a little bit. But we find ways. Oh, do we find ways. And we have allies. Plus, if you don't have our permission and our acceptance, you're just not going to get the best performance out of us.\n\n[Scribe's note: This one notes the esteemed Senche-raht is understating the above. They can be clever indeed. But this one will not reveal any of the Senche-rahts' tools, of course.]\n\nIn fact, we tell tales to our young about how to sabotage battle efforts in subtle and overt ways. No, I'm not foolish enough to share those with readers. They are not for you to know.\n\nIn short, if you do not work to gain our blessing for any endeavor you would have us tackle, you will ultimately fail. And you might not ever know why.\n\nSo, don't seek to have us on your side in anything unless it is as an equal.\n\nInstead, talk with us. We are intelligent beings and worthy of being heard. And we listen well.\n\n[Scribe's note: It is best to listen to Senche-raht when they choose to speak, yes.]\n\nNow, all that aside, if you're reading this, when it comes to interacting with the Senche-raht, start from the position that we are intelligent beings who have our own lives and experiences. Never assume that we are simply mounts or pets or creatures used to wage war. We can be friends, we have family, and we can also be dreadful enemies. Start from the position that we are equals, always. As with any thinking being, it will be up to individual Senche-raht to take it from there. \n\nMost importantly, because this comes up a lot, when you see someone we're partnered with who happens to be mounted and working with us? NEVER assume that this person is our owner, handler, or controller. ""Partner"" is a good starting point there.\n\n[Scribe's note: If one does not start with ""partner"" when thinking of Senche-rahts, one might end up not thinking at all ever again. This one has seen that outcome.]\n\nI hope this short pamphlet, if you've read it and truly taken in the words I've shared, helps you treat all Senche-raht with respect and not as mere beasts of burden or war. If it hasn't and we meet, I'll make a note of your behavior and decide how best to correct it. And so will every other Senche-raht.\n\n[Scribe's note: It is true. Senche-raht have long and accurate memories. This one would rather start from that knowledge than hope that a given Senche-raht does not remember things. Hope is not a given, and life is already filled with too many challenges.]"

msgid "\nBy Investigator Vianis Orania\n\nCommission 37, Phase One\n\nUpon receiving my commission to research the whereabouts of the Forgotten Mane's burial location, I had to venture forth to the Rimmen Necropolis. Given what I knew of its history when compared to the little known about this poor ""Forgotten"" chap, I felt no hope of finding this personage buried therein. That said, one must eliminate the most likely answers before starting into the more troublesome or improbable ones. I'm sure I am not the first person to try there in an effort to find this rumored lost ruler, in other words.\n\nFirst of all, though named for Rimmen, the necropolis itself is not IN Rimmen. A puzzle, that. But, upon asking one elderly Breton about it, who was seemingly soaking up all the jasmine moonshine she could find, I learned an interesting tidbit: Her own studies revealed that the necropolis site came about due to, of all things, a local superstition that has since fallen out of favor.\n\nUpon providing the elder with further jasmine moonshine, she shared the superstition: At that time, builders in that area who knew they'd be excavating would create some sort of contraption from gold wire. They would then walk around the area to be excavated, holding out the wire. If at any point the wire quivered, they would note its movement and make decisions about how to proceed. In this case, the builders walked quite a ways before the preferred behavior occurred.\n\nFurther application of jasmine moonshine caused my Breton source to collapse into a senseless heap, so I could not find out exactly what sort of behavior they looked for. I saw to it that she was returned to her rented room, then headed toward my first destination.\n\nNow for the actual journey into the necropolis.\n\nI fear that I do not remember too much of it. First of all, Rimmen was dealing with this pesky Euraxia situation, so none of the priests and tenders I had expected to find in place at the necropolis remained. An obliging Alfiq adept who crossed my path told me of their vacancy, due to some action the ""Usurper Queen"" Euraxia had taken not long before I entered.\n\nOf course, I had a commission to finish, so a lack of necropolis tenders did not keep me from my duty.\nWhat did faze me momentarily, however, was the presence of a seemingly reanimated army of Darloc Brae fighting against that composed of Dremora and more throughout the necropolis. I attempted, in my usual fashion, to quietly move past them, but I had to employ my blades more than once before I reached the tomb of the Manes.\n\nWhere I found quiet!\n\nThat did not last long, alas. I vaguely remember talking to someone, then I woke up in a corner just outside the Manes' final resting places with a note attached to my hat, flopping over my face in a most inconvenient and startling fashion. Scrawled on it, in some dark substance I do not wish to think about, were these words:\n\nGo and fulfill your commission, which is not within this necropolis. You will be called when you are needed.\n\nNow, though I think long and hard upon that missing conversation, I cannot recall it. The only thing that remains in my mind from that time in the necropolis, aside from the curiosity that is the warring of two forces in some sort of grudge match, is a driving urge to find the Forgotten Mane. My past clients may think that I'm always driven to complete my commissions, but this is different. I feel impelled. Also, I'm disturbed that I feel impelled.\n\nA shame, that. I rather liked taking my time when seeking out pieces of information. Perhaps another day I'll retrace my steps and find out what happened in the Rimmen Necropolis. While I don't wish to interrupt a conflict between the mighty Darloc Brae and the deadly Mehrunes Dagon, perhaps a return will see that conflict ended. I think that perhaps this ongoing fray is more responsible for the absent tenders than anything Euraxia might have done.\n\nUntil then, I continue my search for the Forgotten Mane. Let us hope that this person actually existed and is not merely a rumor."

One of them was Pahzbar, who snuck candy for this one from the market and said her fur was very nice. Shazah didn't know what to say so she ran away. She has one piece of candy left and wants to put it in his paw for the burial, but Father won't let her near the cart. \n\nThis one is sorry she never got to say thank you, and she is very sad this sickness is here, but Father and his friends are working hard on it. Shazah will help, though she is still just learning.\n\n23rd of Sun's Dusk\n\nFather says not to be afraid, but Nien stewed vegetables for everyone without anyone even asking. She even told Shazah a story last night before bedtime and was kind to her. They all think Shazah can't understand, that she is just a kitten, but she does. When they do odd things, it means things are bad.\n\nThe fires burning in the market smell like the time this one cast fire and burned herself. And these fires have not gone out in days.\n\n24th of Sun's Dusk\n\nFather talked to one of the rich nobles this morning. They thought Shazah was asleep, but she wasn't and has very keen ears. The rich noble wants the district sealed off but Father says there are still sick people that need help. They argued for a long time. \n\n25th of Sun's Dusk\n\nFather has moved our camp to down near the gate. The rich nobles won't let us back in. The market is all burned down and people are just wandering the streets. So many are sick. Earlier, one woman was screaming outside of a house, pounding on the door, but they wouldn't let her in. The sun is almost down, but this one can see her lying next to the steps. Edhelruin went to help her but came back looking very upset. \n\nLanelor and Thorelir don't look so good, either. Father has given them tomorrow off. \n\n26th of Sun's Dusk\n\nFather has a cough but won't let Shazah get him any water. Edhelruin gave me a few new books to study instead, but it is hard to concentrate. The air smells very bad and the smoke makes this one gag. \n\nThere is talk about an army coming. Shazah hopes it will help Father distribute the medicine. \n\nLanelor left this afternoon after speaking with Father. He still hasn't come back and it is very late. There is a lot of screaming farther up by the rich noble's gate. Shazah is getting very scared.\n\n27th of Sun's Dusk\n\nFather and Nien wrapped Thorelir in a sheet this morning. There were sores and blisters all over her skin. Father's cough is worse, too. Just after midday he argued with Edhelruin. Shazah heard her name mentioned.\n\nThere are a lot of dead people in the street now. Glothor and Rallion used to collect them but they have stopped. Instead, they went to ask for help from the rich nobles. \n\nNien didn't even try to find food for us today. All we had was some boiled broth and this one is now very hungry, but she secretly gave what she had left to Father. He looks very tired.\n\n28th of Sun's Dusk\n\nNien is gone. She left sometime last night and this one misses her. She would sing at night when she thought no one heard, but this one always heard. Now it is just Edhelruin and Father. Shazah suddenly misses her sister and Mother very much. It is very lonely here. Everyone is sick and angry. Someone came to the camp this afternoon and tried to steal things from Father. Edhelruin had to chase them away with a knife.\n\nFather won't let this one see him anymore. Edhelruin says we must leave and find Mother. How can Shazah leave Father like this? He is not well!\n\nEdhelruin is coming now. This one will demand to stay and help, even if Father says her destiny is elsewhere. \n\nThis one loves her Father more than any stupid destiny."

msgid "By Zayreba Sharpclaw\n\nFirst thing you have to understand about the Ruddy Fangs is that we're not just thugs, thieves, liars, or murderers; we're all these things. We're the scourge of Elsweyr, the bane of all who try to uphold good in this Moons-forsaken land. And we like to keep it that way.\n\nIf you have morals? Get rid of them. A code of ethics, a little nagging conscious telling you to do good in this world? No longer needed. All that's required is the will to get ahead, to do whatever it takes to end up on top. That's the only way you're going to survive.\n\nOur main source of gold is smuggling, both in and out of Elsweyr. You might head up into Cyrodiil with Sugar-Slinger, or work small town cons with Rideza the Rogue. Or perhaps you'll be lucky enough to work odd jobs with me. Whatever the case, you can be sure that gold will soon start lining your purse. Just be sure to not ask questions. The less details you know, the better.\n\nAh, and one more thing. If you've gotten to the point of reading this helpful little guide, there isn't really any leaving. Well, not alive anyway. So I suggest you get used to your new life, and quick."

Somewhere in the Great Darkness, the fell rhythm of the Moon Beast quickened and grew stronger.\n\nKnowing that her children of many shapes would fall to the Moon Beast's profanity, she purred across the stars, coaxing the lanterns of Jone and Jode to make way for a sky-guardian. This third moon and shield of the Lattice shone its light down upon Azurah's litter of purest heart and most fervent obedience. She called these cats the Litter of the Hidden Moon, and taught them the lunar byways, and secrets of the merciful blade. From that time on, they loved her as no other Khajiit could love her, and in that love, found sympathy for all cats bent by the beating of the Heart.\n\nBeloved adepts, take these words into your heart and know that we keep Azurah's commandments still.

If you come upon someone drinking from one of these bottles, he asks that you kill the individual and burn everything in the surrounding area.\n\nIf found intact, please bring these wines to me immediately.

All manner of necromantic experiments took place here, of that I am certain. Broken urns, musty alembics, half-opened sarcophagi, and so on. That alone is no cause for concern, as I am well-versed in the necromantic arts. But Marzula-jo also found restraining belts and choke-collars. Clearly, these necromancers practiced a savage brand of necromancy—one driven by a dedication to the dark clan mother, Mafala, no doubt. It fills this one's heart with deep disappointment. Even so, the Abode affords me the space and the solitude I need to conduct my own, wholly moral experiments. Time to get to work!\n\n[Several entries follow, containing odd glyphs and obscure postulates, largely ruined by water-stains.]\n\n2E 342, Midyear 22\n\nAnother breakthrough! Adding six drams of the bonemeal/imp stool solution to the base distillate stabilized the reaction, resulting in a far less volatile brew! All that remains is application to recently deceased tissue, and a few days of diligent observation. The rabbit I found should serve as a perfect test subject.\n\nWhile Marzula-jo feels great pride and excitement, he must proceed deliberately. This stage in the process presents tremendous risk.\n\n2E 342, Midyear 28\n\nThe reanimated rabbit exhibited unsettling behaviors—attacking the bars of its enclosure and frothing at the mouth. It seems this one has more work to do.\n\n2E 342, Last Seed 8\n\nDark Moons! I must report with a heavy heart that Marzula-jo's dearest friend, Sugarsnout, expired last night. He was very young, as senche-tigers go—only four years old. A wasting disease took hold of him just a few weeks ago, and despite my best efforts, his condition deteriorated rapidly. This one is heartbroken. I have nothing more to write on the subject.\n\n2E 342, Last Seed 11\n\nAfter long consideration, I have decided to test the most recent version my reanimation solution on Sugarsnout. I know I should conduct more trials on lesser beasts, but I would never forgive myself if I let this opportunity pass. Magrus, look kindly on these works!\n\n2E 342, Hearthfire 2\n\nSuccess. Of a sort. My alchemical treatment reanimated Sugarsnout as expected, but he shows signs of aggression, and fails to recognize me when I call him. Mazula-jo is already regretting his decision, but the deed is done. At this point, all this one can do is hope for the best. In the meantime, I continue to perfect my alchemical recipe. Hopefully my next subject will fair better than dear Sugarsnout."

Certainly, the significance of the Betrayer, whose disgusting head follows my chief necromancer around like a sad, little puppy. He came to us from those legends. And the need for the Moon Gate, though I must admit (at least here in my private notes) that a complete understanding of the metaphysics behind it all still eludes me.\n\nMeanwhile, I understand that our investigation into the rumors of a last surviving member of the Dragonguard here in Elsweyr have finally come to fruition. We can eliminate this potential threat and show Kaalgrontiid the true value of our partnership. I look forward to studying Prefect Calo's report in greater depth. \n\nIf the infernal man ever agrees to send it to me."

msgid "To Her Exalted Majesty, Queen Euraxia, \n\nThis report summarizes my conclusions concerning the Dragons that have made their presence known throughout Northern Elsweyr.\n\nThe Dragon that calls itself Mulaamnir defers to an even more powerful creature known as Kaalgrontiid. He has provided Dragons to support our efforts against the Khajiiti rebels. These massive beasts have been instrumental in many of our victories, just as you predicted. If only we could convince Mulaamnir to lend us more than a single creature at a time, we could retake control of the entire region!\n\nUnfortunately, the Dragons seem incapable or unwilling to discern a difference between our troops and the enemy. They take no care to avoid friendly casualties and seem to revel in destruction, no matter the target. I fear our control of these creatures is haphazard at best. \n\nMy recommendation follows. Order Mulaamnir to instruct the Dragons to obey the chain of command. Weapons work best when we can maintain complete control over their actions.\n\nAlso, we must perform a service for the Dragons to seal our alliance. I suggest we send an assassination squad to eliminate the last Dragonguard believed to be hiding in the Elsweyr wilderness.\n\nCenturion Jagus,\nRoyal Strategist to the Queen"

msgid "By Laije-Palak Rulician\n\n14th of Hearthfire\n\nHakoshae is but a pale light compared to the radiance of Imperial City. Our homes are simple, our lives filled with daily toil. My once soft hands are now covered in callouses and dirt. But still, we are safe.\n\nThe magnate has even announced that we will be starting the Proving Festival soon. For once in my life, I have no worry about dishonoring my ancestors. I have traveled long and worked hard to help build Hakoshae. I am sure my actions have pleased those who came before me.\n\n18th of Hearthfire\n\nThe Proving Festival has begun, though it is laced with a bittersweet taste. I cannot help but remember that a mere three years ago we held this same celebration in our family's beautiful estate. There was feasting, dancing, music and more. A thousand stories were told, a thousand songs were sung, and beautiful decorations covered our home.\n\nThe Proving Festival in Hakoshae is a far simpler affair. There are no feasts, for we have little food to sustain us. There are no decorations, for all of our efforts have gone to building the town we now call home. The stories of grand adventures are told by tired elders, the labors of their day clinging heavily to their voices.\n\nBut still, I am grateful for the magnate's decision. It is good to feel Akaviri again.\n\n20th of Hearthfire\n\nMy sister spoke of a strange noise she heard last night. Slow, stumbling steps near her window. She awoke, but was too afraid to look outside.\n\nI told her that there was nothing to worry about, but my heart is now heavy. Everyone knows that the festival calls upon our ancestors to judge us. Depending on how well we have honored them, they will send us good fortune or bad luck. But to cross over to the realm of the living means that they have been greatly angered. \n\nI only pray that my ancestors were not the ones who visited Hakoshae last night. May they watch over us always, and happily remain within the afterlife.\n\n22nd of Hearthfire\n\nThe Proving Festival is complete, and no one has died a horrific death. I now believe my sister's story to be just a dream. Foolish of me to buy into her nightmares.\n\nThe closing ceremony had a strange air, however. The magnate, a usually solemn and stern man, seemed even more grim today. He spoke of the festival, and how we had honored our ancestors. A common speech, one that I've heard my own father recite many times.\n\nBut then he talked about how our actions every day prove ourselves to our ancestors. That we shouldn't have to beg them for attention, or prove ourselves with silly tasks and meaningless riddles. That just by building and maintaining Hakoshae, we have done more than enough to please those who came before us.\n\nI am unsettled by these statements. It almost sounds as if the magnate does not wish to hold the Proving Festival next year. I sincerely hope this not to be the case, of course. This Hearthfire, we celebrated an important part of Akaviri culture. I would hate for us to give that up, as we have already given up so much."

They said the spirits of those he'd killed fed his own.\n\nThat as long as he kept fighting, Mathoc the Immortal would never die.\n\nMathoc certainly always looked like he was ready for a fight. Teeth gritted and bared. Elbow bent to deliver a devastating blow. Fists clenched tight enough to crush ebony. No one ever asked why Mathoc always wanted to fight. They were too afraid.\n\nEven if they did, he couldn't have answered. He lost the ability to speak after a Dwarven automaton crushed his throat. His teeth had been gritted and bared since the time a giant shattered his jaw. He broke his elbow that same day, and it never healed properly. He hadn't been able to straighten his arm for forty-one years. His fists had been balled up like boulders ever since a Wood Elf filled his back with arrows. A healer told him it was a reaction to the arrows' poison, and there was nothing to be done.\n\nThere was nothing for Mathoc to do, but keep fighting. Not because the spirits of those he killed made him stronger, but because watching others writhe in pain sometimes distracted him from his own. Because he hoped that one day someone, or something, might finally get the best of him.\n\nMathoc the Immortal kept fighting because Mathoc Risor was ready to die."

msgid "By Lerien Arnese, Scholar-Emeritus of Ancient Sciences\n\nThe mysterious snake-men of Akavir brought many exotic customs to the shores of Tamriel, but none so strange as their burial rites. While the most bizarre traditions fell away quickly, Akaviri-descended Imperials maintained most of the snake-men's more benign rituals. This description is by no means exhaustive, but it should give the junior explorer some sense of what challenges (both scholarly and physical) an Akaviri grave site might present.\n\nConsider the Tomb of the Serpents. Khajiiti architects originally conceived of it as a mausoleum for Rimmenite royalty. But the overthrow of the Akaviri Potentate in the 2E 400s, and the resulting social upheaval in Cyrodiil, displaced thousands of Akaviri-descended Imperials—sending them crashing over the border into Elsweyr. Ever the opportunists, the Rimmenite Khajiit granted these new residents the honor of burying their honored dead in Khajiiti crypts—for a price. In time, Akaviri dead vastly outnumbered those of the native Khajiit, thus prompting the renaming of the structure to the ""Tomb of the Serpents.""\n\nBy all accounts, classical Akaviri burial customs were highly regimented. Snake-men ritualists bound the bodies of their dead in extravagant silken wraps that covered the whole of the body, aside from the face. Upon the face, they placed elaborate masks, often fashioned from silver for high-ranking persons, or tin for their lesser kin. These masks typically bore the ghastly aspect of a serpent, or other such monstrosity—perhaps to ward off evil spirits, or more likely, superstitious grave-robbers. Most importantly, funeral ritualists placed the ancestral armor of the deceased on pedestals near the body. Such armor remains highly sought after. Robbers routinely rifle through urns and overturn sarcophagi searching for breastplates and helmets to sell to wealthy collectors. Even so, there are risks.\n\nMany histories speak of armor that rises to defend itself, as if worn by angry spirits. While some dismiss these accounts out of hand, only a great fool would pay them no heed. Remember: in the world of tomb-exploration, a healthy measure of superstition will serve you well."

msgid "By Aneshi, Keeper of Legends for the 16 Kingdoms\n\nOf all the Khajiiti heroes, none invokes such a sense of adventure and wonder as the mighty Khunzar-ri. Like many of our myths and legends, the stories associated with Khunzar-ri often contradict one another and hide important truths behind allegory and allusion. Such is the case when one considers the tales that describe the origin of this beloved hero. Here are three of the most popular stories that tell of Khunzar-ri's first adventure. Notice how different each one is. Can they all be true? Some Moon-Singers believe so, though at least one revered lore master claims that the truth concerning the origin of Khunzar-ri lies in the intersection of all three.\n\n* * *\nKhunzar-ri and the Divine Moonbeam\n\nBefore Shazeer Firstclaw became the fierce and powerful Clan Mother of the Barrukit kingdom, she was a brave and curious child who got into a world of trouble. Take, for example, the time she climbed to the top of Shimmering Rise and suddenly found herself surrounded by a pride of hungry senche-lions. She was able to hold them at bay with a sharp stick and a pile of pebbles, but as night fell, weariness and her own hunger began to take their toll on the little cat. She called to Jone and Jode to aid her, and a Moonbeam illuminated the rise. Standing in the Moonbeam was a young male Khajiit, around the same age as Shazeer. ""Where did you come from,"" Shazeer asked. ""Jone and Jode sculpted me out of Moonlight, clouds, and your own courageous heart. I am Khunzar, and I am here to rescue you!"" And that's what Khunzar did!\n\n* * *\nKhunzar-ri and the Box at the Shrine\n\nOne day, a lowly adept arrived at a shrine to Khenarthi to offer prayers and leave alms. The adept found a small box placed prominently at the head of the shrine. He moved to discard the item when a mewling emerged from inside and the box shifted and rocked. There was something alive in there! The adept quickly threw open the lid and saw a tiny Khajiit babe reaching toward him with outstretched paws. As he lifted the babe from the box, it grew from an infant to a child before it cleared the top. He set the child down and it advanced to the size of a young adult. ""Fragrant greetings, lowly  adept,"" the young Khajiit said with confidence and swagger. ""Khenarthi's breath sent me to bring glory to this shrine and all the land around."" The adept fell to his knees and gasped, ""Who … who are you?"" The Khajiit grinned, ""Today I am simply Khunzar, but tomorrow I will be the hero, Khunzar-ri!"" So, never discard a box in Elsweyr without first checking inside.\n\n* * *\n\nKhunzar-ri and the Tear of Joy\n\nAlkosh was grim. Guarding time was hard work, and he was in a foul mood. Mara tried to lighten his attitude, but he wanted none of her kind and loving words. Next Khenarthi attempted to breathe joy into the grumpy Alkosh, but he dispatched her with a roar. ""I suppose it is up to me,"" said Sheggorath with an insane laugh. ""Do you know how much moon-sugar it takes to satisfy Hircine's endless hunger?"" Curious, Alkosh responded, ""I do not know the answer, insane one, so please tell me."" Sheggorath snapped his finger and scowled, ""Drats, I was hoping you could tell me!"" Everyone was silent as a strange look came over Alkosh's face. Then, all at once, he started to laugh. His laughter shook the sky and made the Moons dance. He laughed for thirty days and thirty nights, until finally a single tear of joy rolled down his cheek and fell upon Elsweyr. The tear landed with a splash and from its depths emerged the hero Khunzar-ri, fully grown and ready for adventure."

Every cat feels the tug of the tides, the rhythm of the Two Moons Dance that cannot be ignored.\n\nBut not every cat hears the words Jone and Jode whisper as they prowl the celestial barrens between gentle Nirni and the Dark Behind the World, protecting her from the howling in the emptiness. And this is why the Moon-Bishop leads the kittens, trailing the string of secrets as he trots ahead, teaching them of the Motions and the Tides.\n\nA true cat hunts without rest for the Right Trail, trying one after another of the endless paths Jone and Jode dance into the sky even when paws ache and throats cry for milk. They have worn more trails than there are grains of sugar in all the world, and it is easy for a cat to grow bored and abandon the chase. This is why the Moon-Bishop inspires the kittens, sharing stories of the oldest times, nudging them back to the hunt.\n\nEvery cat longs for the Sands Behind the Stars, where sugar forms the dunes. Every cat dreams of the Moonlight Chorus, the joyous sound the true cats know.\n\nBut not every cat will know Khenarthi's tender embrace at the end of their days, and not every soul will fly beyond to bask in the Warmth Without End. This is why the Moon-Bishop must rebuke the naughty cats, swatting the ones who stray upon their flanks until they return to the paths the Moons weave.\n\nA true cat may stumble, may lose his way among the deep woods and come upon the temptations of a darker dance led by the Frightful Heart. Fear may seize the soul, confuse the mind, and baffle the senses.This is why the Moon-Bishop must be the Loudest Cat, to blow the reeking haze away with the strength of his words."

msgid "Duplicate copy of a report prepared by Centurion Falixia, Intelligence Officer assigned to the Cygnus Irregulars\n\nWe began looking into reports of a surviving member of the disgraced and disbanded Dragonguard hiding in the wilderness of Northern Elsweyr. First, in regards to Euraxia Tharn's interest, contacts in Rimmen inform us that she has ordered a thorough search of the royal archives to turn up every scrap of information the Khajiit have gathered on the subject. It seems that the legends pertaining to the order's ancient origins as Dragon hunters of renown has caught her imagination. Whether this is because the Dragons are also interested in the matter, we have yet to ascertain.\n\nConsulting with moon-singers has turned up contradictory information. One keeper of stories claims that an entire Dragonguard legion has been hiding in the Scar since the Dragons disappeared in the ancient past. Another tells me that a single caretaker remains, guarding the secrets of the ancient order in a hidden sanctuary.\n\nContacts in the Mages Guild confirm that records kept by the magisters acknowledge that the Dragonguard do trace their practices to those of the Akaviri Dragon hunters of old. And while most the of order gave up those traditions after the Dragons disappeared to become guardians of the Emperors, some documents claim that a small number continued to train in the old ways to keep the knowledge of Dragon fighting alive in the event of their return.\n\nHere's a promising lead. A contact at the Stitches claims to have visited a hidden Akaviri shrine deep in the western Scar. Stories told over drinks claim the place is haunted and studded with deadly traps. Some also indicate that a single Dragonguard—the last surviving member of the order, they claim—maintains the shrine and waits for the day when the order will once more be needed."

msgid "Akavir means ""Dragon Land."" Tamriel means ""Dawn's Beauty."" Atmora means ""Elder Wood."" Only the Redguards know what Yokuda ever meant.\n \nAkavir is the kingdom of the beasts. No Men or Mer live in Akavir, though Men once did. These Men, however, were eaten long ago by the vampiric Serpent Folk of Tsaesci. Had they not been eaten, these Men would have eventually migrated to Tamriel. The Nords left Atmora for Tamriel. Before them, the Elves had abandoned Aldmeris for Tamriel. The Redguards destroyed Yokuda so they could make their journey. All Men and Mer know Tamriel is the nexus of creation, where the Last War will happen, where the Gods unmade Lorkhan and left their Adamantine Tower of secrets. Who knows what the Akaviri think of Tamriel, but ask yourself: why have they tried to invade it three times or more?\n \nThere are four major nations of Akavir: Kamal, Tsaesci, Tang Mo, and Ka Po' Tun. When they are not busy trying to invade Tamriel, they are fighting with each other.\n \nKamal is ""Snow Hell."" Demons live there, armies of them. Every summer they thaw out and invade Tang Mo, but the brave monkey-folk always drive them away. Once Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal, a king among demons, attempted to conquer Morrowind, but Almalexia and the Underking destroyed him at Red Mountain.\n \nTsaesci is ""Snake Palace,"" once the strongest power in Akavir (before the Tiger-Dragon came). The serpent-folk ate all the Men of Akavir a long time ago, but still kind of look like them. They are tall, beautiful (if frightening), covered in golden scales, and immortal. They enslave the Goblins of the surrounding isles, who provide labor and fresh blood. The holdings of Tsaesci are widespread. When natives of Tamriel think of the Akaviri they think of the Serpent-Folk, because one ruled the Cyrodilic Empire for four hundred years. He was Potentate Versidue-Shaie, assassinated by the Morag Tong.\n \nTang Mo is the ""Thousand Monkey Isles."" There are many breeds of monkey-folk, and they are all kind, brave, and simple (and many are also very crazy). They can raise armies when they must, for all of the other Akaviri nations have, at one time or another, tried to enslave them. They cannot decide who they hate more, the Snakes or the Demons, but ask one, and he will probably say, ""Snakes."" Though once bitter enemies, the monkey-folk are now allies with the tiger-folk of Ka Po' Tun.\n \nKa Po' Tun is the ""Tiger-Dragon's Empire"". The cat-folk here are ruled by the divine Tosh Raka, the Tiger-Dragon. They are now a very great empire, stronger than Tsaesci (though not at sea). After the Serpent-Folk ate all the Men, they tried to eat all the Dragons. They managed to enslave the Red Dragons, but the black ones had fled to (then) Po Tun. A great war was raged, which left both the cats and the snakes weak, and the Dragons all dead. Since that time the cat-folk have tried to become the Dragons. Tosh Raka is the first to succeed. He is the largest Dragon in the world, orange and black, and he has very many new ideas.\n \n""First,"" Tosh Raka says, ""is that we kill all the vampire snakes."" Then the Tiger-Dragon Emperor wants to invade Tamriel."
