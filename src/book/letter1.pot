msgid "Congratulations on your daring expedition to the Halls of Fabrication. We're all interested to hear about the private works of a Living God. I'd be a lot more impressed if you hadn't glided through on the robe hems of that philandering wizard, but the others insist that you're deserving of more than a pat on the backside. Enjoy it.\n\nI hope you're keeping better company than that parchment skinned old codger now that you've returned to the land of flesh and beauties. Take it from Felvyn, you don't want Divayth Fyr anywhere near a promising bevvy of betties unless you fancy drinking alone. What's so intriguing about staring at stars anyway? But I digress.\n\nToasting to you,\n\nFelvyn the Swordarm"
