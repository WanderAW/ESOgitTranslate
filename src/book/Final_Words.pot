My poor mother longed for me to find steady work, to be safe, to one day put a grandchild in her arms. I would not listen. I could not.\n\nI don't have long to live. I feel the coldness of the snake venom slithering through my veins. I am out of potions. I thought to face the trial of the Ghost Snake, to walk the Coiled Path. A Mabrigash wisewoman warned me against it. Curse my nature! I ignored her.\n\nI'm not afraid, but I do have one sorrow. The amulet my mother gave me was lost when the snake delivered the poison that's now killing me. I regret that my last words to my mother were hard ones. Cold, willful. And that I lost the amulet my mother gave to me when I was a young girl.\n\nIf you're reading this, may you fare better on the Coiled Path than I. If you find a small gold amulet engraved with an R on one of the serpents, take it to my mother, Aneyda Uvaril, at Tal'Deic Fortress. \n\nTell her my last thoughts were of her."

msgid "I am inside at last. It took me several days of watching and waiting, but I am patient. I was rewarded with a mass exodus at twilight yesterday. The entire group, accompanied by their cave bears, left on some quest that was doubtless of great importance to them.\n\nThe door to their caves beneath Serpent Hollow had been left slightly ajar and I slipped inside. I moved cautiously through the cave's winding passages, fearful of meeting a guard. But there were none. I found a perfect observation post, secreted myself behind some boxes, and was settled in with my supplies long before the expedition returned.\n\nI am elated to report that the rumors are true. The ogres residing here are indeed unusually intelligent. I will take diligent notes for the three weeks my supplies will last. I can already hear the applause when I present my findings to my colleagues in the Imperial City, once this foolish war is over.\n\nDay 1: Settled into my post undetected. Ogres and cave bears returned hours later. Several seemed to hesitate, sniffing the air deeply, but they soon moved on to normal activities.\n\nDay 2: I have witnessed tool use and rudimentary communication among these ogres! The big one, the one I have dubbed ""Bruuke,"" pointed at a crate and grunted several times at one of his underlings. That worthy scowled, grabbed the crate, and threw it into a corner, shattering it and scattering its contents about. That seemed to appease Bruuke, who scratched himself in satisfaction.\n\nDay 3: These caves were obviously once the site of humanoid habitation, likely Imperial miners. Possibly the ogres came upon these folk and killed them in the process of claiming the cavern for their own. But the ogres have cleverly adapted the implements the miners left behind. Fires have been carefully tended and kept burning, and I have seen a shield used as a plate. The ogres also stage impromptu concerts using human bones and skulls as primitive instruments.\n\nDay 4: Today I witnessed play behavior among the clan. Bruuke picked up a long bone, possibly a miner's femur, struck a bear on the nose with it, and threw it into the water. The bear chased after it and returned it to Bruuke. Soon the other ogres and bears were playing this game as well. It entertained the entire clan for most of the day. I believe this is behavior never before documented among ogres.\n\nDay 5: I have no doubt that Bruuke is the source of this clan's cleverness. Several times yesterday, as I wrote in my journal, I saw him peer suspiciously about. I believe he hears the sound of my quill scratching on the paper and recognizes it as unusual, possibly dangerous. If he ever comes over here to investigate, then I will —"

The cats explained that they were the few survivors of a terrible massacre at Thibaut's Cairn, where they were employed as groundskeepers. While the fantastic tales of cats do not normally interest me, I felt I was duty bound to at least investigate the claims, in the name of the Queen. How bitterly do I regret that decision now.\n\nDay 18\n\nThe dead are unstoppable. No matter how many of them we destroy, more of the ancient dead rise up to face us. My men fought like eagles, but exhaustion and overwhelming numbers are taking their toll. Nearly half of the brave soldiers I led into this crypt have joined the dead.\n\nDay 21\n\nWhere are they coming from? Who controls these abominations? If I could find the source and destroy it, perhaps my men and I could escape this place! I fear that all of us will soon lend our bones to the foul force that animates the dead here.\n\nDay 22\n\nI'm all alone now. The last of my men have fallen in a desperate attempt to make it back to the entrance of the crypt. I ordered them to stand fast, but they revolted at the thought of perishing here in the small camp we've set up. I can't say that I blame them. Perhaps I should have gone with them, to fight, to die … to try one last time to see the light of day."

And tell her that the little house and everything inside it belongs to her now. \n\nShor's bones! The trolls are coming! I'll see you in Sovngarde, my love!\n\n— Betra Fairskin"

Here, I am treating the injuries suffered by Shornhelm Guard soldiers in the aftermath of an unwarranted attack by forces bearing the colors and tabards of House Montclair.\n\nAldred Berri: Stab wound to the right abdomen, applied a healing poultice and wrapped the wound tightly.\n\nFinia Derone: Took an arrow in her right arm, just above the elbow. Applied a healing poultice and wrapped the wound tightly. She should be ready for duty as needed.\n\nMarbenn Dugot: Sword slash across the stomach exposed his intestines and he lost much blood. I have done what I can, but I do not believe he will last the night.\n\nLeobert Favret: A spear puntured his left lung. I have given him a tincture to relieve his pain, but there is little more I can do for him. I expect the end to come quickly.\n\nRolbert Emain: I have not determined the exact nature of his wound, for it doesn't resemble any weapon I am familiar with. If I didn't know any better, I'd say he was gutted by the claws of a large animal. I have applied healing tinctures to the wound, and remarkably it appears to be closing. I'll need to watch Rolbert closely to see if there are any adverse effects.\n\nPixot Gane: Another strange wound, this one along the left side of the neck and down the back. It appears to be a combination of bites and scratches, but the soldier claims he doesn't remember how the wounds were inflicted. He burns with fever, and nothing I have provided has yet to alleviate his discomfort.\n\nVivie Donze: This soldier received a shallow cut across her right side and should be capable of returning to duty immediately. However, she claims that the wound burns and her stomach hurts. Is she faking these symptoms or did I miss something in my examination?\n\nI must also report that I was apparently hurt as well, though I don't remember how. I discovered a deep scratch along my left arm, as though something with long, sharp nails drew a line down my arm. The cut isn't that serious, which is why I haven't informed Lieutenant Fairfax as yet, but it does burn. And I find myself unusually hungry, although food doesn't appeal to me."

Of course, no giants are found in the region today, so I'm not sure how much to believe these stories. The place is certainly full of giant accouterments, though.\n\nThe bones of massive mammoths, including skulls topped with great horns, adorn the walls of the cavern. Since such creatures have never been known to roam the Rivenspire wilderness, the presence of their bones lends some credence to the tales of sojourners from the frigid wastes of Skyrim, though.\n\n***\nAs I write these words, I am listening to sounds coming from the entrance to the caves. Could it be bandits? A wild animal, perhaps? I sincerely hope it's just some traveler, looking for shelter from the wind and rain. Either way, I had better go see what's going on.\n\n***\nNords! There are Nords in Rivenspire and they're moving into Breagha-Fin! Should I talk to them? Try to reason with them and convince them to let me leave?

msgid "Entry 1\nClear weather. Put out of Southshore with all hands. If any doubt the power of the Gold Fleet, they won't when we cross the horizon.\n\nEntry 2\nClear weather. By some ill-conceived joke we are to be joined by a squadron of Khajiit-led privateers. Something about ""appealing to the natives through diplomatic overture."" Surely they have a better use for us than playing nursemaid to ruffians.\n\nEntry 3\nChoppy seas. If we're the pride of the Dominion, the privateers are its disgrace. A more ragtag assembly of barnacle-crusted vessels I've never set eyes upon! We would make better time if we scuttled the lot of them.\n\nEntry 4\nClear weather. Strange sails on the horizon. We've all heard the reports—a Sea Viper fleet reaving along the coasts of Auridon—though nothing to speak of a presence here. More Khajiit barnacles latching onto our hull? I would not be surprised. The Peregrine dispatched to investigate.\n\nEntry 5\nRough seas. The Peregrine was unable to locate its quarry and heavy winds prevent us from pursuing further. Strange, our Sighter indicated clear weather for at least three days.\n\nEntry 6\nLost … collided with … taking on water. First Mate sighted … ago. No sign of … Prowler in the mist, but then it was gone. Swears he saw coils in the waves … belowdecks to sober up.\n\nHigh winds tore … from the rigging. Mast is gone. No choice but to … shore. Instructed all hands to … as is my duty.\n\n<<1>>, I apologize. In this, and … failed you."
