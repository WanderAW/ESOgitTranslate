To that end, he occasionally sends weapons of great power to Tamriel. Players who take up these weapons have their standard ability bar icons replaced by a suite of new and terrifying Artifact abilities!

These Alliance Points are tracked in a unique meter found in the player UI. Points acquired from sources other than quests and repairing structures will fuel the weapon. If the meter is fully depleted, however, the weapon turns on the wielder, killing them and stripping them of their Artifact powers."
