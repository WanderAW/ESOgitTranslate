"An Excerpt\n"
"\n"
"Written by the Esteemed Historian Homfrey at the University of Gwylim, 2E 455\n"
"\n"
"Being a Survey of the Triumphant Settlement of the Heartland High Elves in the Southern Regions \n"
"\n"
"…At this point, we should mention the remarkable cities of Ceyatatar, and the Ayleid settlement beneath what is now modern Bravil. These cities, along with the Valenwood cities of Haven, Woodhearth, and Silvenar, all flourished as a result of increased trade after the establishment of the great White-Gold Tower in what is now the heart of Cyrodiil. \n"
"\n"
"Of note in particular is the university and libraries at nearby Elden Root. The Ayleids there built their city in and around what is called the Elden Tree or the First Tree, believed by many to be the tree that seeded all of Valenwood. \n"
"\n"
"Both Haven and Woodhearth were destroyed utterly by the sieging Maormer, who cared little for the advanced and enlightened ways of the Valenwood Aldmer. Marching inland, they plundered not only the Elden Root enclave, but also the Great Tree itself.  What villainous tribe would injure and pillage such magnificence? \n"
"\n"
"It is possible that the Maormer had broken the Aldmer traditions of racial purity and intermingled with indigenous, bestial tribes of Pyandonea. This would explain their savagery and lack of regard for the greatness of mainland Elven culture."

"\"Mix it like this,\" said Rakhal. She ground wet clay and herbs beneath her pestle with rhythmic strokes. \"The very act of creating the paint is a prayer.\"\n"
"\n"
"Yashirr grasped her own stone pestle, pulled her bowl closer and imitated the priestess.\n"
"\n"
"Pound! Lift! Scatter a handful of herbs into the bowl, and pound again! The Orcs sat close together, knee to knee, bowls held in curve of their bent knees.\n"
"\n"
"Rakhal chanted softly, swaying with her movements. Gradually, as the group's rhythm strengthened, her voice gained matching volume.\n"
"\n"
"\"Mauloch!\" Pound!\n"
"\n"
" \"Witness …\" Lift!\n"
"\n"
"\"… our deeds!\" Scatter!\n"
"\n"
"The honor of preparing tribal paint went to a handful of the Chief's daughters. Yashiir had never sat in the circle before. In prior years, she'd gathered the herbs and clay, but nothing more. Now she sat at Rakhal's right hand in a place of honor. Pride washed through the young Wood Orc. Clearly, she had been chosen as an apprentice!\n"
"\n"
"\"Mauloch!\" Pound!\n"
"\n"
"\"Give us …\" Lift!\n"
"\n"
"\"… blood!\" Scatter!\n"
"\n"
"At that final word, the women threw back their heads and released Mauloch's Call, a throaty howl that echoed through the trees and nearby cliffs. Rakhal signaled their work's completion.\n"
"\n"
"The tribe lined up to be painted with the fresh battle-red clay. Rakhal waved those she deemed unworthy or unfit for the battle aside. They weren't allowed to partake in the painting ritual.\n"
"\n"
"When Rakhal motioned to Yashirr to step from the line, Yashirr parted her lips to protest, then pursed them tightly. To question Rakhal's judgment would bring dishonor. Bowing her head in confused anger, Yashirr joined the handful of the unselected Orcs.\n"
"\n"
"Rakhal looked over the unselected, and pulled Yashirr to her side. \"Mauloch chose you to perform the next ritual, child. Take the blade and remember: Mauloch watches you.\"\n"
"\n"
"Guiding Yashirr's hand, Rakhal leaned over the empty vessel and slid the young Orc's blade across her outstretched neck. Rakhal's hand did not falter even as she slipped from consciousness in order to provide the next paint with the sacred blood of a true warrior."

"By Naral, also known as Baretail. The memoir is undated.\n"
"\n"
"My children, Naral sets this down to give insight into the strange ways of the Wood Elves amongst whom some of you travel. Beware their vengeful ways!\n"
"\n"
"Preparations began months ago for the wedding feast of the two highest Wood Elves. Their union shows that the forest and its people are as one. Hence, a very large feast.\n"
"\n"
"As a trader, I've often been tasked with providing tidbits for royalty. I name no names, but freely admit to providing biscuits dusted with moon sugar for banquets in Elden Root on more than one occasion. Still, this wedding feast required many things outside my purview, and I was forced to make last-minute changes.\n"
"\n"
"To get fifty vats of beef broth, I supplemented the thirty vats available by adding root vegetable broth.  Knowing the Wood Elves are not squeamish about the dead, I provided ten crates of bone marrow from whatever bones were available, asking no questions as to their origins.\n"
"\n"
"But cake with no flour? Never had I seen such a thing before! I consulted with several Wood Elf bakers who assured me such a thing was possible, as Wood Elves eat nothing green unless prepared by outsiders. Given that, their restriction that I provide cakes without flour flummoxed me. I got a couple of recipes and checked with my suppliers, none of whom could provide the desired quantity in time.\n"
"\n"
"Thus, I set about making them myself. I thinned the eggs with water to make them stretch. I added arrowroot and powdered flax seed to thicken it. Sugar proved the most dear component of the cakes, so I added ground chalk to reduce the actual amount of sugar needed. The taste was similar to cake. Very similar. And since they took so little time and gold to make, my profit doubled from the cakes alone.\n"
"\n"
"It was the substitution of flax seed oil whipped with lard instead of butter that proved my undoing, and the undoing of many a guest's bowels.\n"
"\n"
"Not only did the Wood Elves rescind any future contracts, but they shaved my tail and confiscated all the gear and goods I'd left behind in my hasty retreat.\n"
"\n"
"Never, my children, offer to supply goods for a Wood Elf feast. It will only end in tears."

"The storm threw an unexpected twist in Captain Saraja's plan. She eyed the pirate sloop's torn sails and broken mast. Not only had their most recent haul washed overboard, but now they'd be becalmed until they could afford repairs.\n"
"\n"
"\"We're as good as grounded,\" First Mate Huruz said grimly.\n"
"\n"
"\"If we see another ship, I'm sure we can talk them out of it,\" the captain replied with a throaty chuckle. \"We're disabled, but still afloat. You're always thinking about disasters.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Better safe than … is that another ship?\"\n"
"\n"
"Saraja turned and grinned. \"Our future ship, you mean.\"\n"
"\n"
"Huruz eyed the distance and said thoughtfully, \"It's not that far. Let's lower the dinghy.\"\n"
"\n"
"Within moments, the Khajiiti crew prepared themselves to row to the other vessel. It was anchored near a sandbar and appeared undamaged. As they approached, Saraja scanned the line between the ship and sky, looking for movement. All quiet. Ripe for the plunder.\n"
"\n"
"Huruz climbed up, slowly digging into the ship's dark hull. He had to overpower any guard on this side, enabling the rest of the crew to secure lines and board. Landing softly on the deck, Huruz glanced quickly fore and aft. No guards. He leaned over the rail and signaled the crew.\n"
"\n"
"One by one, the pirates boarded, padding along the deck silently with weapons drawn until they were all aboard the silent ship.\n"
"\n"
"\"Too big a ship to be on a pleasure cruise,\" Huruz murmured to the captain. \"And too quiet to be well-armed.\"\n"
"\n"
"Saraja nodded, gesturing toward the cabin's door. \"They're hiding in there,\" she whispered. \"Time for them to get off my ship.\"\n"
"\n"
"With a loud battle cry, Huruz kicked open the cabin door. The pirates, claws unsheathed and weapons high, pushed in after him before coming to a stop not ten paces into the quiet, dark space.\n"
"\n"
"\"What's amiss?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Quick! Get me a light!\"\n"
"\n"
"One of the pirates slammed tinder and flint together. He raised the torch slowly, its warm glow reflecting across dozens of mirrors strewn throughout the cabin.\n"
"\n"
"\"By Jone and Jode, Kothringi!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Dead Kothringi!\"\n"
"\n"
"Saraja ordered everyone back to their crippled ship, though it was already too late. No one who'd seen the Crimson Ship ever lived to tell the tale, and her crew had done more than see it."

"Life for many in the Aldmeri Dominion begins in Valenwood. Green, forested, filled with a wide variety of plant and animal life, and home to some of the first Elves from Old Ehlnofey.\n"
"\n"
"Over time and through generations, these early settlers adapted to the woods. They learned stealth and cunning by studying their new prey. Eventually, they became Wood Elves, or Bosmer. Slighter than the Altmer, intense and agile, the Bosmer are renowned archers and scouts.\n"
"\n"
"Fierce combatants, the Bosmer have an unusual advantage: the Green Pact. According to Bosmer legend, Y'ffre the Forest God offered them a way to defeat their enemies, providing they did not consume, harm, or harvest any of Valenwood's plants. \n"
"\n"
"Many have heard of the Wild Hunt, one result of the Green Pact. Of this ritual, I will say no more.\n"
"\n"
"The Bosmer welcome those who come to Valenwood seeking refuge from other lands. In this regard, they are quite unlike their pure Altmer cousins. While we seek to retain our dignity, the Bosmer are quite willing to bend like saplings to the will of others.\n"
"\n"
"Though they are unruly and naive, these Wood Elves are an integral part of the Dominion, and must be retained in order for our alliance to flourish."

"Willowleg rubbed his ankle. Not broken, just twisted. He stood, putting weight on it very carefully. Good. It would hold. He'd fallen while on a journey through Valenwood. One of his legs was thinner than the other.  Sometimes he forgot.\n"
"\n"
"\"Now to figure out where I am,\" Willowleg said. He looked at the swaying leaves high above, the hint of blue sky occasionally peeking through. To anyone but a Wood Elf, those brief glimpses would convey nothing, but Willowleg immediately turned to continue on his way.\n"
"\n"
"Soon, he realized he wasn't alone. A little to his left walked another Wood Elf, dark green hair hanging unkempt about his face. Willowleg, used to traveling alone, noticed that his silent companion adjusted his pace to remain close without overtaking him.\n"
"\n"
"\"Going to Falinesti, too?\" Willowleg asked.\n"
"\n"
"\"Yes.\"\n"
"\n"
"Willowleg said congenially, \"I hope I reach the summer site before it's too late.\"\n"
"\n"
"The green-haired Wood Elf said, \"You'll be fine.\" His tone indicated he didn't wish to speak further, so Willowleg simply nodded and kept walking.\n"
"\n"
"They traveled together, silently, for the rest of the day. When Willowleg stopped to rest, the stranger also stopped. Willowleg shared water and dried meat. Then they began the last part of their journey. The trees thinned out, leaving a clearing into which Falinesti fit perfectly.\n"
"\n"
"At the clearing's edge, the stranger stopped and put a hand on Willowleg's arm. Surprised, Willowleg realized the green-haired Elf's skin was rough and thick, like bark.\n"
"\n"
"\"Stay here,\" the stranger said, murmuring an incantation.\n"
"\n"
"Willowleg, unable to move or speak, watched his companion walk to Falinesti's base and touch its bark with his forehead. The tree-city shuddered and began to move slowly, lifting its roots from the earth.\n"
"\n"
"As the green-haired Elf walked off, leading Falinesti away, Willowleg felt the strange spell over him break, and movement returned with a tingling force through his limbs. He glanced down and saw that not only had his thin leg healed, but his shoes were missing.\n"
"\n"
"\"The Woodsmer,\" Willowleg whispered in awe. The Woodsmer, the mythic one who led the unwary astray in the woods, was also known to bestow favors on those who knew their way.\n"
"\n"
"As Falinesti moved southward, Willowleg wondered which the city was."
