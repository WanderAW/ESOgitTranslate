"By Gabrielle Benele, Daggerfall Mages Guild\n"
"\n"
"As a former member of the faculty at the University of Gwylim, I take an interest in matters of practical pedagogy, and I've spent the last two seasons reviewing our Mages Guild curricula for the instruction of beginning spellcasters. This body of work has accumulated gradually over several centuries, and as a result it is somewhat haphazard and disorganized. \n"
"\n"
"After casting about for a model upon which to reorganize our teaching texts, I came upon the curriculum of the Shad Astula Academy in Morrowind, where they teach magic in eight different disciplines. Though the divisions between the disciplines, or \"schools\" of magic, are rather arbitrary, magic being an entirely mutable art, this classification of spellcasting into schools of magic has the advantage of providing students with a structure for easy comprehension of the basics of wizardry. The proof of its value is the fact that Shad Astula graduates novice mages with a practical grasp of sorcery in half the time of our own introductory program.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, I propose that we adopt the Shad Astula disciplines, and reorganize the Mages Guild study program into the following schools of magic:\n"
"\n"
"ALCHEMY: The study of the magical virtues of different forms of matter, their effects, combinations, and recombinations. To include the concoction of potions, elixirs, and magical draughts.\n"
"\n"
"ALTERATION: The distortion of local reality through direct imposition of the mage's will. To include spells of paralysis, water breathing, water walking, lock opening, and personal elemental shields such as flame cloaks. \n"
"\n"
"CONJURATION: The summoning and binding of spirits from Oblivion or Aetherius. To include soul trapping, spells that conjure Daedra or other creatures, spells to banish same, summoning of bound weapons and armor, as well as (for classification purposes) the forbidden necromantic arts of reanimation, conjuration, and manipulation of the undead. \n"
"\n"
"DESTRUCTION: The splintering of material bonds by the direct application of force, typically elemental in nature. To include damaging spells of flame, frost, shock, and disintegration, as well as magic that drains essence or personal attributes.\n"
"\n"
"ILLUSION: Altering perception in oneself or others. To include spells of light, invisibility, fear, frenzy, and silence, as well as magic that affects morale and obedience. \n"
"\n"
"MYSTICISM: The class of spells used to alter the nature of magic itself. To include effects that dispel or absorb both spells and the magicka that feeds them, as well as telekinesis (which fits here as well as anywhere).\n"
"\n"
"RESTORATION: The opposite of destruction, magic that resists damage or restores wholeness by reknitting the damaged material. To include wards, healing, curing of disease and poison, physical fortification, and the turning of undead (a forced purification effect).\n"
"\n"
"THAUMATURGY: Magic that affects the will and personal state of mind. To include spells that calm or charm others, reflection of or resistance to magic, as well as levitation, which involves the personal rejection of gravity. \n"
"\n"
"The experienced mage will immediately discern the arbitrary nature of these divisions—indeed, we may eventually find it advisable to combine one or more of these schools, assigning the spells within them to other categories. (Thaumaturgy seems a likely candidate for such amalgamation, and possibly Mysticism, as well.) However, these schools seem to be serving Shad Astula well, so I propose we tentatively adopt them as is, and refine as we go."

"By Beredalmo the Signifier\n"
"\n"
"Since time immemorial, devout mortals of Tamriel have built shrines to their Divines at sites that have been recognized as holy and sanctified. Many of these sites were chosen due to specific miracles or blessed events that marked them, though others simply inspire feelings of reverence for matters divine. Because they are located here and there where inspiration struck, rather than at points of convenience, these sites are scattered across the land, and have come to be known as \"wayshrines.\" \n"
"\n"
"Of course, the shrines built at these sites by devout worshipers reflect the local religious beliefs, and are constructed and adorned so as to honor the foremost local Divines. Many priesthoods believe that wayshrines act as direct conduits to Aetherius, and that when a mortal dies his or her soul is drawn to the nearest wayshrine, where it meets some sort of psychopomp or spiritual escort, who leads the soul to the afterlife. Though this is a mystical matter and therefore not susceptible to scholarly proof, it is striking that so many different faiths across Tamriel endorse this belief. \n"
"\n"
"As all know, the stars in the heavens are perforations in the Mundus through which shines the magical light of Aetherius. Lord Corvus Direnni theorized that the locations of wayshrines on Tamriel correspond to the pattern of stars in the night sky, because our Mundus is a reflection of Aetherius. However, to test this theory we would need a comprehensive map of every wayshrine site on Tamriel, a task too daunting to contemplate, so proof of this hypothesis, if true, will have to come from another source. \n"
"\n"
"Lord Corvus was also a renowned conjurer, who devised and promulgated the standard \"portal\" spells now popularized by the Mages Guild. (His work was based on the pioneering research of the Ayleid sorcerer known to history as \"The Transmigrant.\" But that is liquor for a different cocktail.) Corvus theorized that, if one only knew how, the wayshrines could be used as a permanent portal network by which one could travel rapidly across Tamriel. He speculated that such a \"fast traveler\" would need to somehow attune himself to a wayshrine, which would add its \"node\" to the traveler's \"web of sojourn.\"\n"
"\n"
"However, in order to learn how to do this, the great Direnni wizard believed a mortal's soul would have to be, temporarily or permanently, \"unmoored from the Mundus.\" I am not at all certain what that phrase means, and if Lord Corvus understood it, none of his written memoirs explain what he meant by it. Based on my studies of the notebooks left behind in Lord Corvus' workshop in Direnni Tower, proof and implementation of this theory eluded him, and eventually he abandoned it to return to perfecting variations on Koron's Peremptory Summons."

"Mages Guild Memorandum: Confidential, Magisters Only\n"
"\n"
"From Vanus Galerion, Archmagister Emeritus\n"
"\n"
"If you pay attention to the popular fads and fashions of spellcasting in your guildhalls, you have doubtless noticed the recent surge of interest in the discipline of \"soul trapping.\" Unlike most of the passing fancies that come and go among the magical fraternity, I consider this particular vogue alarming and dangerous. \n"
"\n"
"There are reasons why soul trapping has never been part of the core curriculum of the Mages Guild, taught to only the most experienced and dependable wizards, and then only for certain specific uses. First of all, it is technically a subset of necromancy, and on that basis alone it should be abhorred. (Except, as mentioned, for certain special cases, and then only under controlled conditions.) Second, it is a magical technology that practically invites abuse, especially when employed to trap the souls of sentient mortals. It is the sort of arcane practice that the public fears most, and is likely to result in local bans on the organized teaching of magic, and if that happens all our work in establishing the Guild will have been in vain. \n"
"\n"
"The fact that soul trapping is now common knowledge among Tamriel's magery, to the point where so-called \"Mystics\" sell soul gems of various sizes in every market and bazaar, is a problem that can be laid squarely at the feet of the iniquitous Mannimarco and his Order of the Black Worm. It is all part of his program to make necromancy seem commonplace and almost harmless. In some parts of Tamriel, notably Cyrodiil, the vile practice of necromancy has even become accepted as a valid, and legally tolerated, magical discipline. What our old mentor Iachesis would have to say about this pernicious development I hate to think. \n"
"\n"
"So what are we to do about it? I have been giving the matter some hard thought, in between rooting out cells of the ever-burgeoning Worm Cult, and I think at this point the only way to gain control over soul-trapping is to co-opt the practice. Therefore I propose the Mages Guild codify and systematize the various soul-trapping magics into a common grimoire of a few reliable spells, and then teach our members that these, and only these, are the legal and authorized methods for trapping souls. \n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, I propose that for the purposes of soul trapping we categorize all souls into two classes: the legal, or \"White\" souls, those smaller essences that are captured from beasts and animals, and illegal, or \"Black\" souls, which are derived from sentient mortals. And we will teach only those spells that can capture White souls, forbidding our students to use the larger soul gems on sentients. \n"
"\n"
"It will take several generations, and the suppression of the Worm Cult, for this dichotomy to become the pan-Tamrielic standard for soul trapping. But if the Mages Guild can't take the long view for the good of Tamriel, who can?"

"It is easy to confuse Illusion and Alteration. Both schools of magic attempt to create what is not there. The difference is in the rules of nature. Illusion is not bound by them, while Alteration is. This may seem to indicate that Alteration is the weaker of the two, but this is not true. Alteration creates a reality that is recognized by everyone. Illusion's reality is only in the mind of the caster and the target.\n"
"\n"
"To master Alteration, first accept that reality is a falsehood. There is no such thing. Our reality is a perception of greater forces impressed upon us for their amusement. Some say that these forces are the gods, others that they are something beyond the gods. For the wizard, it doesn't really matter. What matters is the appeal couched in a manner that cannot be denied. It must be insistent without being insulting.\n"
"\n"
"To cast Alteration spells is to convince a greater power that it will be easier to change reality as requested than to leave it alone. Do not assume that these forces are sentient. Our best guess is that they are like wind and water. Persistent but not thoughtful. Just like directing the wind or water, diversions are easier than outright resistance. Express the spell as a subtle change and it is more likely to be successful."

"환영 (Illusion)과 변화 (Alteration)는 혼동하기 쉽다. 두 마법학파 모두 거기에 존재하지 않는 것을 만들어 내려 한다. 이 두 학파의 차이점은 작동원리에 있다. 환영은 변화처럼 그것에 묶이지 않는다. 이 점은 변화가 환영보다 약하다는 것을 의미하는 것 같지만 그렇지 않다. 환영은 단지 사용자와 목표 대상의 마음에만 존재하지만 변화는 모두가 인식할 수 있는 진짜를 만들어 낸다.\n"
"\n"
"변화를 익히기 위해서는 먼저 현실은 허위라는 사실을 받아들여야 한다. 현실은 없다. 우리의 현실은 우리에게 인상을 주는 거대한 힘에 대한 인식이다. 몇몇은 이러한 힘이 신이라 이야기 하고 다른 몇몇은 신을 뛰어넘은 그 이상의 것이라 말한다. 마법사에게 있어서 그것은 실질적으로 중요하지 않다. 중요한 것은 부정할 수 없는 방법에 놓여진 수단이다. 그것은 반론할 수 없는 주장이다.\n"
"\n"
"변화 마법을 사용한다는 것은 현실을 그대로 두는 것보다 마음먹은대로 바꾸는 것을 쉽게 만드는 힘에 대해 확신하는 것이다. 이러한 힘들을 지각할 수 있을거라고 여기지는 말라. 그저 바람이나 물같은 것이라고 생각하는편이 좋을 것이다.  영구적이지만 의지를 가진 것은 아니다. 바람이 부는 방향처럼, 물이 흐르는 방향처럼, 변화는 완벽한 저항보다는 쉽다. 약간씩 변화를 주면서 마법을 사용하는 편이 성공하기 쉬울 것이다."

"\n"
"By Arch-Prelate Fervidius Tharn\n"
"\n"
"Though all given Concavities, or sheaths within the integument of the Aurbis, are necessarily contained by the Aurbis, Right Reaching dictates that a defined sheath may be detached from the integument by invocation of Mnemoli. Upon intercourse with the star-orphan, the Beseeching Alesstic performs eversion of the organ of thought, an employment of the Hurling Disk that recapitulates the truth that a circle turned sidewise is a Tower. By same-truth, twisting the enveloping sheath into the middle dawn (to the number of seventeen) brings it to untime and unplace.\n"

"Eventualism, of course, predicts reabsorption upon depletion of the Wheeling Force, but the absence of duration may render even eventuality moot."

"Customs and Philosophy of Grave and Faithful Counsel\n"
"\n"
"by Celarus the Loremaster\n"
"\n"
"We who know the Old Ways are well aware of the existence of a spiritual world invisible to the unenlightened. Just as one living in a kingdom but unaware of the political machinations underneath may see a new tax or battle preparation as the caprices of fortune, many observe floods, famines, and madness with helpless incomprehension. This is deplorable. As the great Cuilean Darnizhaan moaned, \"The power of ignorance can shatter ebony like glass.\"\n"
"\n"
"What, after all, is the origin of these spiritual forces that move the invisible strings of Mundus? Any neophyte of Artaeum knows that these spirits are our ancestors—and that, while living, they too were bewildered by the spirits of their ancestors, and so on back to the original Acharyai. The Daedra and gods to whom the common people turn are no more than the spirits of superior men and women whose power and passion granted them great influence in the afterworld.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly this is our truth and our religion. But how does it help us in our sacred duty of seliffrnsae, or providing \"grave and faithful counsel\" to lesser men?\n"
"\n"
"Primarily, it is easy to grasp the necessity both of endowing good men with great power and making powerful men good. We recognize the multiple threats that a strong tyrant represents—breeding cruelty which feeds the Daedra Boethiah and hatred which feeds the Daedra Vaermina; if he should die having performed a particularly malevolent act, he may go to rule in Oblivion; and worst of all, he inspires other villains to thirst after power and other rulers to embrace villainy. Knowing this, we have developed patience in our dealings with such despots. They should be crippled, humiliated, impoverished, imprisoned. Other councilors may advocate assassination or warfare—which, aside from its spiritual insignificance, is expensive and likely to inflict at least as much pain on the innocents as the brutish dictator. No, we are intelligence gatherers, dignified diplomats—not revolutionaries.\n"
"\n"
"How, then, are our councilors \"faithful?\" We are faithful only to the Old Ways—it is essential always to remember the spiritual world while keeping our eyes open in the physical one. Performing the Rites of Moawita on the 2nd of Hearth Fire and the Vigyld on the 1st of Second Seed are essential means of empowering salutary spirits and debilitating unclean ones. How, then, are we at once faithful to those we counsel and to the Isle of Artaeum? Perhaps the sage Taheritae said it best: \"In Mundus, conflict and disparity are what bring change, and change is the most sacred of the Eleven Forces. Change is the force without focus or origin. It is the duty of the disciplined Psijic [\"Enlightened One\"] to dilute change where it brings greed, gluttony, sloth, ignorance, prejudice, cruelty… [here Taheritae lists the rest of the 111 Prodigalities], and to encourage change where it brings excellence, beauty, happiness, and enlightenment. As such, the faithful counsel has but one master: his mind. If the man the Psijic counsels acts wickedly and brings oegnithr [\"bad change\"] and will otherwise not be counselled, it is the Psijic's duty to counterbalance the oegnithr by any means necessary [emphasis "
"mine].\"\n"
"\n"
"A student of the Old Ways may indeed ally himself to a lord—but it is a risky relationship. It cannot be stressed enough that the choice be wisely made. Should the lord refuse wise counsel and order the Psijic (to use Taheritae's outmoded word) to perform an act contrary to the teachings of the Old Ways, there are few available options. The Psijic may obey, albeit unwillingly, and fall prey to the dark forces against which he has devoted his life. The Psijic may abandon his lord, which will bring shame on him and the Isle of Artaeum, and so may never be allowed home again. Or the Psijic may simply kill himself."

"The Beginning Spellcaster\n"
"\n"
"The most powerful mages in Tamriel were once beginners. They all had similar early experiences: exposure to magic kindled an interest or unlocked some latent ability, followed by years of hard work. These intrepid souls honed their skills, learned new spells, and vigorously trained their minds and bodies to become the formidable figures they were known as during their later lives.\n"
"\n"
"The Mages Guild of Tamriel has long been the first stop on a long road to knowledge and power for many individuals. Providing magical services to the general public, the Guild offers a wide variety of spells for purchase, and is recommended as a first stop for any aspiring spellcaster. Independent dealers may be found, though their selection of spells is often not as comprehensive as that of the Mages Guild.\n"
"\n"
"Many spells are beyond the capabilities of beginning mages; the ability to render one's self invisible, for example, is an advanced power and is beyond the novice spellcaster. Through practice, a mage may become more skilled in a given school of magic and find himself proficient enough to begin exploring its more powerful aspects. The fledging mage should not be daunted by his inability to wield certain powers, but should instead use this as a point of focus and a drive for bettering himself. Rather than becoming discouraged, the student should look forward to higher levels of skill, such as the advanced techniques of absorbing spells, summoning lesser (and eventually greater) Daedra and undead—for research purposes only—and protection against specific types of spells, such as Flame, Frost, and Shock spells.\n"
"\n"
"Mages wishing to specialize in a particular school of magic are encouraged to learn as many spells as possible within that school, and to practice them frequently. All mages, whether specializing or nurturing a general interest, are encouraged to apply for membership within the Mages Guild. Beyond services available to the general public, the accomplished Guild member has access to many exclusive services. These services have been deemed potentially dangerous to the public at large, and have been restricted to higher-ranked Guild members in good standing by the Council of Mages.\n"
"\n"
"Citizens interested in the further use of magic should consult their local Mages Guild Magister."

"by Zeroli Jarol\n"
"\n"
"The ancient Ayleids believed that Nirn was composed of four basic elements—earth, water, air, and light—and of these four elements, they believed the most sublime form of light was starlight. The stars are our links to the plane of Aetherius, the source of all magical power, and therefore, light from the stars is the most potent and exalted of all magical powers.\n"
"\n"
"From time to time, fragments of Aetherius fall from the heavens. The people know these fragments as \"shooting stars,\" and from time to time, such Aetherial fragments are found on Nirn. The most common varieties are known as \"meteoric iron\"; this metal is prized by armorers and enchanters for its properties in the forging of enchanted weapons and armors. This meteoric iron is also the primary component in \"Ayleid Wells,\" ancient enchanted artifacts found throughout Cyrodiil.\n"
"\n"
"Another, rarer form of Aetherial fragment is called \"meteroic glass.\" It is from such fragments that other rare Ayleid enchanted artifacts are crafted; namely, Welkynd Stones and Varla Stones.\n"
"\n"
"Ayleid Wells are scattered across Cyrodiil's landscape. They remain a mystery, as they are not associated with any known Ayleid cities or settlements. It is presumed that in some manner, they harvest magical power from starlight. It is also suggested without evidence or support that they are located at the meeting points of ancient lines of magical power; however, modern arcane arts have discovered no perceptible evidence of such lines of power.\n"
"\n"
"Those with magical talents can draw magicka from Ayleid Wells to restore their own reservoirs of magical power. No ritual or arcane knowledge is necessary, suggesting that these wells were designed to serve persons not skilled in the magical arts. Once drained, the wells replenish again only at magical midnight. Once recharged, they appear to radiate magical power back into the sky, which prompts some to theorize they are also objects with religious or magical ritual significance, perhaps a means of offering magic back to the heavens.\n"
"\n"
"Welkynd Stones (in Aldmeris: \"sky stone,\" \"heaven stone,\" or literally, \"sky child\") are pieces of cut and enchanted meteoric glass which apparently act as storage devices for magical power. A magical talent can restore his reservoirs of magicka from such stones. Alas, the means of restoring power to these stones may have been lost with the Ayleids. Currently, these objects simply crumble to dust after they have been used.\n"
"\n"
"Great Welkynd Stones are exceptionally large pieces of enchanted meteoric glass. Scholars believe that at the heart of each ancient Ayleid city, a Great Welkynd Stone was the source of the settlement's magical enchantments. It may be that these great stones were linked to the lesser stones, restoring and maintaining their power. In any case, research on these Great Welkynd Stones is impossible, since all the known Ayleid ruins have been looted of their great stones, and no examples of these great stones are known to survive.\n"
"\n"
"Another rare enchanted item found in Ayleid ruins is called a Varla Stone (in Aldmeris: \"star stone\"). Varla Stones are remarkably powerful, enabling untrained users to restore magical energy to any number of enchanted items. Because of their great value and utility, these items are also extremely rare, but since they are small and easily concealed, diligent explorers may still occasionally come across them in any Ayleid ruin.\n"
"\n"
"Ayleid Wells, Welkynd Stones, and Varla Stones—consider these marvels of magical enchantment. Are we then to conclude that the Ayleids were a superior race and culture? Did they so exceed us in art and craft that they mock the feeble powers of Second Era Wizards?\n"
"\n"
"Never! The Ayleids were powerful, yes, and cunning, but they were neither good nor wise, and so they were struck down. Their works have passed from Nirn, save these rare and sparkling treasures. Their ancient cities are dark and empty, save for the grim revenants and restless spirits condemned forever to walk the halls, keeping their melancholy vigils over bones and dust."

"Transliminal passage of quickened objects or entities without the persistent agency of hyperagonal media is not possible, and even if possible, would result in instantaneous retromission of the transported referents. Only a transpontine circumpenetration of the limen will result in transits of greater than infinitesimal duration.\n"
"\n"
"Though other hyperagonal media may exist in theory, the only known transliminal artifact capable of sustained transpontine circumpenetration is the sigil stone. A sigil stone is a specimen of pre-Mythic quasi-crystalline morpholith that has been transformed into an extra-dimensional artifact through the arcane inscription of a Daedric sigil. Though some common morpholiths like soul gems may be found in nature, the exotic morpholiths used to make sigil stones occur only in pocket voids of Oblivion and cannot be prospected or harvested without Daedric assistance.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, since both the morpholiths and the Daedric sigils required for hyperagonal media cannot be obtained without traffic and commerce with Daedra Lords, it is necessary that a transliminal mechanic cultivate a working knowledge of conjuration—though purpose-built enchantments may be substituted if the mechanic has sufficient invocatory skill. Traffic and commerce with Daedra Lords is an esoteric but well-established practice, and lies outside the compass of this treatise. [1]\n"
"\n"
"Presuming a sigil stone has been acquired, the transliminal mechanic must first prepare the morpholith to receive the Daedric sigil.\n"
"\n"
"Let the mechanic prepare a chamber, sealed against all daylight and disturbances of the outer air, roofed and walled with white stone and floored with black tiles. All surfaces of this chamber must be ritually purified with a solution of void salts in ether solvent.\n"
"\n"
"A foursquare table shall be placed in the center of the room, with a dish to receive the morpholith. Four censers shall be prepared with incense compounded from gorvix and harrada. On the equinox, the mechanic shall then place the morpholith in the dish and intone the rites of the Book of Law, beginning at dawn and continuing without cease until the sunset of the same day.\n"
"\n"
"The mechanic may then present the purified morpholith to the Daedra Lord for his inscription. Once inscribed with the Daedra Lord's sigil, the morpholith becomes a true sigil stone, a powerful artifact that collects and stores arcane power—similar in many respects to a charged soul gem, but of a much greater magnitude. And it is this sigil stone that is required to provide the tremendous arcane power necessary to sustain the enchantment that supports the transpontine circumpenetration of the limen.\n"
"\n"
"To open a gate to Oblivion, the mechanic must communicate directly, by spell or enchantment, with the Daedra Lord who inscribed the sigil stone in question. The Daedra Lord and the mechanic jointly invoke the conjurational charter [2], and the mechanic activates the charged sigil stone, which is immediately transported through the liminal barrier to the spot where its sigil was inscribed, thus opening a temporary portal between Mundus and Oblivion. This portal may only remain open for a brief period of time, depending on the strength of the liminal barrier at the chosen spots, several minutes being the longest ever reported, so the usefulness of such a gate is quite limited.\n"
"\n"
"[1] Interested students are invited to consult the works of Albrecht Theophannes Bombidius and Galerion the Mystic for the fundaments of this discipline.\n"
"\n"
"[2] Recommended examples of the conjurational charter may be found in Therion's Book of Most Arcane Covenants or Ralliballah's Eleven Ritual Forms."

"따라서 다른 차원으로 뛰어넘는 매개체를 만드는 것에 필요한 요소인 모폴리스와 데이드릭이 없다면, 다시 말해서, 데이드릭의 군주들과의 교류 및 교역 없이는 불가능하므로, 차원을 넘나들고자 하는 사람은 차원관문을 소환하기 위해 실용적인 지식을 기를 필요가 있다 -- 그 사람이 마법에 관한 능력이 충분히 있다면, 소환용으로 만들어진 대용품을 사용하는 것도 가능하다. 데이드릭의 군주들과의 교류 및 교역은 소수만 이해하는 일이기는 하지만 잘 알려진 시도이며, 본문이 의도하는 내용에는 해당하지 않는다. [1]\n"
"\n"
"그런데, '인장석'을 이미 얻었다고 가정해보자. 차원을 넘나들고자 하는 사람이 데이드릭의 인장을 받기 위해서는 우선 모폴리스를 준비할 필요가 있다.\n"
"\n"
"태양의 빛, 그리고 바깥 공기를 모두 차단해서, 특수한 목적으로 만들어진 천장과 벽, 및 검은 타일을 친 마루를 갖춘 방을 준비한다. 이 방의 모든 표면은 에테르 용매에 담근 공허의 소금 용액으로 반드시 의식적으로 맑게 해야 한다.\n"
"\n"
"모폴리스를 받기 위한 그릇을 정사각형 테이블에 놓고, 테이블은 방의 중앙에 설치한다. 4개의 낚시 향로에는 고빅스 (Gorvix)와 하라다 (Harrada)를 섞은 향을 준비한다. 사용자는 밤과 낮을 정확히 반으로 나눈 시간에 그릇 속에 모폴리스를 넣어 새벽부터 중단하는 일 없이 그날의 일몰까지 '질서의 책' 의식을 영창한다.\n"
"\n"
" 그 후, 사용자는 정화된 모폴리스에 비문을 받기 위해서 데이드릭의 군주들에게 서신을 보낸다. 데이드릭 군주들의 증표를 새겨 둔 후, 모폴리스는 신비의 힘을 채취하고, 저장하는 강력한 비밀스러운 보물, 즉, 진정한 의미의 '인장석'이 된다. -- 여러 가지 관점에서 보자면 소울젬과 유사하지만, 이것은 한층 더 큰 규모이다. 그리고, '의식의 한계'에서 차원관문을 만들기 위해선 마법의 지속이 꼭 필요한데, 이 마법을 지속하기 위해 막대한 신비의 힘을 공급하려면 이 '인장석'이 반드시 필요하다.\n"
"\n"
" 오블리비언의 문을 열기 위해서는, 사용자가 부가마법 또는 마법을 이용하고, '인장석'에 데이드릭 군주들의 증표를 새겨 직접 교신할 필요가 있다. 데이드릭 군주들과 사용자는 서로 연대해서 소환의 계약을 행사해 [2], 사용자가 '인장석'을 발동시킨다. 이것에 의해서, 문두스와 오블리비언의 사이에 일시적인 차원 관문이 열려, '인장석'은 즉각적으로 '의식의 한계'의 장벽을 넘고, 증표가 새겨진 장소로 이동한다. 그 선택된 장소에 있는 의식의 한계와 장벽의 강도에 따라서 이 차원관문이 계속 열리고 있는 시간은 상당히 짧을 가능성이 있다. 지금까지의 보고서에 의하면 문이 열려 있는 시간은 몇 분정도가 최대치이므로 이 문의 실용성은 매우 한정되어 있다.\n"

"FORM THE FIRST: Makest thou the Mana Fountain to be Primed with Pure Gold, for from Pure Gold only may the Humors be rectified, and the Pure Principles coaxed from the chaos of Pure Power. Droppest thou then the Pure Gold upon the surface of the Mana Fountain. Takest thou exceeding great care to safeguard yourself from the insalubrious tempests of the Mana Fountain, for through such Assaults may one's health be utterly Blighted.\n"
"\n"
"FORM THE SECOND: Make sure that thou havest with you this Excellent Manual, so that thou might speak the necessary Words straightaway, and without error, so that thou not in carelessness cause thyself and much else to discorporate and disorder the World with your component humors.\n"
"\n"
"FORM THE THIRD: Take in hand the item to be Restored, and hold it forth within the Primed Fountain, murmuring all the while the appropriate phrases, which are to be learned most expeditiously and faultlessly from this Manual, and this Manual alone, notwithstanding the vile calumnies of Kharneson and Rattor, whose bowels are consumed by envy of my great learning, and who do falsely give testament to the efficacies of their own Manuals, which are in every way inferior and steeped in error.\n"
"\n"
"FORM THE FOURTH: Proceed instantly to Heal thyself of all injuries, or to avail yourself of the Healing powers of the Temples and Healers, for though the agonies of manacaust must be borne by any who would Restore a prized Arcana to full Potency, yet it is not wise that suffering be endured unduly, nor does the suffering in any way render the Potency more Sublime, notwithstanding the foolish speculations of Kharneson and Rattor, whose faults and wickednesses are manifest even to the least learned of critics."

" 첫번째: 마나의 샘이며 순수한 금으로 가득찬 메이키스트 도우 (Makest thou), 그곳의 금은 유머를 종식하였고 순수한 원리로써 혼돈을 깨끗한 힘으로 바꾸어 놓았다. 드라피스트 도우 (Droppest thou)는 마나의 샘 위의 순수한 금을 말한다.  테이키스트 도우 (Takest thou)는 마나의 샘의 건강에 좋지못한 영향으로부터 당신을 지켜준다. 이러한 행위로 한 생물의 건강을 완전하게 한다.\n"
"\n"
"두번째: 이 우수한 안내서로 도우 (thou)가 당신이 필요한 말을 즉시 할 수 있도록 하고, 또한 실수와 부주의 없이하여 당신의 유머로 세상을 혼란에 빠뜨려 놓아라.\n"
"\n"
"세번째: 물품을 주어 회복되게 하면서, 샘 앞쪽을 향해 들고 있어라. 그리고 그동안  이 매뉴얼에서 신속하고 완벽히 배울 수 있는 적절한 구절을 영창하라. 이 안내서 하나로도 질투로 똘똘 뭉쳐있으며 그 자신들의 저급하고 오류로 점철된 안내책자에 헛된 선서를 하는 카네슨과 래터의 비열한 비방을 막을 수 있다.\n"
"\n"
"네번째: 즉시 너의 상처를 회복하라. 사원과 치유사들에게서 치료를 받을수도 있다. 그러나 마나카우스트는 아르카나 를 효능으로 가득차게 할 사람에게서 이루어져야 할 것이다. 그러나 여전히 과도하게 상처입는 것은 현명하지 못하다. 또한 효능을 과도하게 남용하여서도 안된다. 배우지 못한 비평가의 비판이나 저급한 사색으로도 카네슨과 래터의 잘못과 결점은 명백하다."
