"The following are notes gathered, over the past centuries, of items of unimaginable significance. All have been seen, owned, and lost, again and again throughout Tamriel. Some may be myth, others may be hoax, but regardless, many have lost their lives attempting to find or protect these very coveted items.\n"
"\n"
"Skull Crusher\n"
"\n"
"The Skull Crusher is an amazingly large and powerful weapon. This warhammer was created in a fire, magically fueled by the Wizard, Dorach Gusal, and was forged by the great weaponsmith, Hilbongard Rolamus. The steel is magically hardened and the weight of the weapon is amazingly light, which makes for more powerful swings and deadly blows. The warhammer was to be put on display for a festival, but thieves got it first. The Skull Crusher still travels Tamriel in search of its creators.\n"
"\n"
"Spear of Bitter Mercy\n"
"\n"
"One of the more mysterious artifacts is the Spear of Bitter Mercy. Little to nothing is known about the Spear. There are no recorded histories but many believe it to be of Daedric origin.\n"
"\n"
"Spell Breaker\n"
"\n"
"Spell Breaker, superficially a Dwemer tower shield, is one of the most ancient relics of Tamriel. Aside from its historical importance in the Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, the Spell Breaker protects its wielder almost completely from any spell caster, either by reflecting magics or silencing any mage about to cast a spell. It is said that Spell Breaker still searches for its original owner, and will not remain the property of anyone else for long. For most, possessing Spell Breaker for any length of time is power enough.\n"
"\n"
"Staff of Hasedoki\n"
"\n"
"Hasedoki was said to have been a very competitive wizard. He wandered the land in search for a wizard who was greater than he. To the best of all knowledge, he never found a wizard who could meet up to his challenge. It is said that he felt so lonely and isolated because so many feared his power, that he bonded his life-force into his very own staff, where his soul remains to this very day. Magic users all over Tamriel have been searching for this magical staff. Granting its wielder a protection of magicka, it is a sure prize for any magic user.\n"
"\n"
"Staff of Magnus\n"
"\n"
"The Staff of Magnus, one of the elder artifacts of Tamriel, was a metaphysical battery of sorts for its creator, Magnus. When used, it absorbs an enemy's health and mystical energy. In time, the Staff will abandon the mage who wields it before he becomes too powerful and upsets the mystical balance it is sworn to protect.\n"
"\n"
"Umbra Sword\n"
"\n"
"The Umbra Sword was enchanted by the ancient witch Naenra Waerr, and its sole purpose was the entrapment of souls. Used in conjunction with a soul gem, the Sword allows the wielder the opportunity to imprison an enemy's soul in the gem. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but not before she was able to hide the Sword. The Umbra Sword is very choosy when it comes to owners and therefore remains hidden until a worthy one is found.\n"
"\n"
"Vampiric Ring\n"
"\n"
"One of the more deadly and rare artifacts in Tamriel is the Vampiric Ring. It is said that the Ring has the power to steal its victim's health and grant it to the wearer. The exact nature and origin of the Ring is wholly unknown, but many elders speak of its evil creation in Morrowind long, long ago by a cult of Vampire followers. The Vampiric Ring is an extremely rare artifact and is only seen every few hundred cycles of the moons.\n"
"\n"
"Warlock's Ring\n"
"\n"
"The Warlock's Ring of the Archmage Syrabane is one of the most popular relics of myth and fable. In Tamriel's ancient history, Syrabane saved all of the continent by judicious use of his Ring, and ever since, it has helped adventurers with less lofty goals. It is best known for its ability to reflect spells cast at its wearer and to improve his or her speed and to restore health. No adventurer can wear the Warlock's Ring for long, for it is said that the Ring is Syrabane's alone to command."

"\n"
"Ice Blade of the Monarch\n"
"\n"
"The Ice Blade of the Monarch is truly one of Tamriel's most prized artifacts. Legend has it that the Evil Archmage Almion Celmo enchanted the claymore of a great warrior with the soul of a Frost Monarch, a stronger form of the more common Frost Atronach. The warrior, Thurgnarr Assi, was to play a part in the assassination of a great king in a far off land, and become the new leader. The assassination failed and the Archmage was imprisoned. The Ice Blade freezes all who feel its blade. The Blade circulates from owner to owner, never settling in one place for long.\n"
"\n"
"Lord's Mail\n"
"\n"
"Sometimes called the Armor of Morihaus or the gift of Kynareth, this is an ancient cuirass of unsurpassable quality. It grants the wearer power to absorb health, resist the effects of spells, and cure oneself of poison when used. It is said that whenever Kynareth deigns the wearer unworthy, the Lord's Mail will be taken away and hidden for the next chosen one.\n"
"\n"
"Mace of Molag Bal\n"
"\n"
"Also known as the Vampire's Mace, the Mace of Molag Bal drains its victims of magicka and gives it to the bearer. It also has the ability to transfer an enemy's strength to its wielder. Molag Bal has been quite free with his artifact. There are many legends about the Mace. It seems to be a favorite for vanquishing wizards.\n"
"\n"
"Masque of Clavicus Vile\n"
"\n"
"Ever the vain one, Clavicus Vile made a masque suited to his own personality. The bearer of the Masque is more likely to get a positive response from the people of Tamriel. The higher his personality, the larger the bonus. The best known story of the Masque tells the tale of Avalea, a noblewoman of some renown. As a young girl, she was grossly disfigured by a spiteful servant. Avalea made a dark deal with Clavicus Vile and received the Masque in return. Though the Masque did not change her looks, suddenly she had the respect and admiration of everyone. A year and a day after her marriage to a well-connected baron, Clavicus Vile reclaimed the Masque. Although pregnant with his child, Avalea was banished from the Baron's household. Twenty-one years and one day later, Avalea's daughter claimed her vengeance by slaying the Baron.\n"
"\n"
"Mehrunes' Razor\n"
"\n"
"The Dark Brotherhood has coveted this ebony dagger for generations. This mythical artifact is capable of slaying any creature instantly. History does not record any bearers of Mehrunes' Razor. However, the Dark Brotherhood was once decimated by a vicious internal power struggle. It is suspected that the Razor was involved.\n"
"\n"
"The Mentor's Ring\n"
"\n"
"This simple metal band is a prized possession for any apprentice to magic. It lends the wearer the ability to increase their intelligence and wisdom, thus making their use of magic more efficient. The High Wizard Carni Asron is said to be the creator of the Ring. It was a construct for his young apprentices while studying under his guidance. After Asron's death, the Ring and several other possessions vanished and have since circulated throughout Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"Ring of Khajiit\n"
"\n"
"The Ring of the Khajiit is an ancient relic, hundreds of years older than Rajhin, the thief that made the Ring famous. It was Rajhin who used the Ring's powers to make himself invisible and as quick as the breath of wind. Using the Ring, he became the most successful burglar in Elsweyr's history. Rajhin's eventual fate is a mystery, but according to legend, the Ring rebelled against such constant use and disappeared, leaving Rajhin helpless before his enemies.\n"
"\n"
"Ring of Phynaster\n"
"\n"
"The Ring of Phynaster was made hundreds of years ago by a man who needed good defenses to survive his adventurous life. Thanks to the Ring, Phynaster lived for hundreds of years, and since then it has passed from person to person. The Ring improves its wearer's overall resistance to poison, magicka, and shock. Still, Phynaster was cunning and cursed the Ring so that it eventually disappears from its holder's possessions and returns to another resting place, discontented to stay anywhere but with Phynaster himself.\n"
"\n"
"Ring of Surroundings\n"
"\n"
"Little is known of this prize but it is said that it lends the wearer the ability to blend in with their surroundings.\n"
"\n"
"Ring of the Wind\n"
"\n"
"No facts are known about this Ring, but the title and the few rumors lend one to think it grants the wearer added speed."

"\n"
"Boots of the Apostle\n"
"\n"
"The Boots of the Apostle are a true mystery. The wearer of the boots is rumored to be able to levitate, though nobody has ever seen them used.\n"
"\n"
"Bow of Shadows\n"
"\n"
"Legend has it that the Bow of Shadows was forged by the Daedra Nocturnal. The legendary ranger, Raerlas Ghile, was granted the Bow for a secret mission that failed, and the Bow was lost. Raerlas did not go down without a hearty fight and is said to have, with the aid of the Bow, taken scores of his foes with him. The Bow grants the user the ability of invisibility and increased speed. Many sightings of the Bow of Shadows have been reported, and it is even said that the sinister Dark Elf assassin, Dram, once wielded this bow.\n"
"\n"
"Chrysamere\n"
"\n"
"The Paladin's Blade is an ancient claymore with offensive capabilities surpassed only by its own defenses. It lends the wielder health, protects him or her from fire, and reflects any spells cast against the wielder back to the caster. Seldom has Chrysamere been wielded by any bladesman for any length of time, for it chooses not to favor one champion.\n"
"\n"
"Cuirass of the Savior's Hide\n"
"\n"
"Another of Hircine's artifacts was the Cuirass of the Savior's Hide. The Cuirass has the special ability to resist magicka. Legend has it that Hircine awarded his peeled hide to the first and only mortal to have ever escaped his hunting grounds. This unknown mortal had the hide tailored into this magical Cuirass for his future adventures. The Savior's Hide has a tendency to travel from hero to hero as though it has a mind of its own.\n"
"\n"
"Daedric Scourge\n"
"\n"
"The Daedric Scourge is a mighty mace forged from sacred ebony in the Fires of Fickledire. The legendary weapon of Mackkan, it was once a fierce weapon used to send spirits of darkness back into Oblivion. The weapon has the ability to summon creatures from Oblivion.\n"
"\n"
"Denstagmer's Ring\n"
"\n"
"All that is known of this Ring is that it may grant the user protection from certain elements. Even the name Denstagmer is a mystery.\n"
"\n"
"Ebony Mail\n"
"\n"
"The Ebony Mail is a breastplate created before recorded history by the Dark Elven goddess Boethiah. It is she who determines who should possess the Ebony Mail and for how long a time. If judged worthy, its power grants the wearer added resistance of fire, magicka, and grants a magical shield. It is Boethiah alone who determines when a person is ineligible to bear the Ebony Mail any longer, and the goddess can be very capricious.\n"
"\n"
"Eleidon's Ward\n"
"\n"
"Eleidon was a holy knight of legend in Breton history. He was a sought after man for his courage and determination to set all wrongs right. In one story, it is said that he rescued a Baron's daughter from sure death at the hands of an evil warlord. For his reward, the Baron spent all of his riches to have an enchanted shield built for Eleidon. The Shield granted Eleidon the opportunity to heal his wounds.\n"
"\n"
"Fang of Haynekhtnamet\n"
"\n"
"Black Marsh was once known to be inhabited with what the Argonians called the Wamasus. Northern men considered them to be intelligent dragons with lightning for blood. One such mighty beast, Haynekhtnamet, was slain by the Northern men, though it took seven days and nights, and a score of men. One of the surviving men took a fang home as a trophy. The fang was carved down into a blade and fashioned into a small dagger. The dagger mysteriously houses some of the beast's magical properties and grants the user the ability to do shock damage on an opponent. This unique dagger is seen occasionally by traveling heroes.\n"
"\n"
"Fists of Randagulf\n"
"\n"
"Randagulf of Clan Begalin goes down in Tamrielic history as one of the mightiest warriors from Skyrim. He was known for his courage and ferocity in battle and was a factor in many battles. He finally met his fate when King Harald conquered Skyrim. King Harald respected this great hero and took Randagulf's gauntlets for his own. After King Harald died, the gauntlets disappeared. The King claimed that the Fists granted the bearer added strength.\n"
"\n"
"Goldbrand\n"
"\n"
"This magical Sword is almost a complete mystery. Thieves tell tales about its golden make and how it was actually forged by ancient dragons of the North. Their tales claim that it was given to a great knight who was sworn to protect the dragons. The Sword lends its wielder the ability to do flame damage to an enemy. Goldbrand has not been sighted in recent history and is said to be awaiting a worthy hero.\n"
"\n"
"Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw\n"
"\n"
"One of Valenwood's legendary heroes is Oreyn Bearclaw. Son of King Faume Toad-Eye, he was a respected clan hunter and a future leader. Wood Elven legend claims Oreyn single handedly defeated Glenhwyfaunva, the witch-serpent of the Elven wood, forever bringing peace to his clan. Oreyn would go on to accomplish numerous other deeds, eventually losing his life to the Knahaten Flu. His Helm stood as a monument of his stature for future generations to remember. The Helm was lost eventually, as the Clan split, and is now a treasured artifact for adventurers. The Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw is rumored to improve the wearer's agility and endurance."

"The Order of the Ancestor Moth is as ancient as it is noble. We nurture and celebrate our beloved ancestors, whose spirits are manifest in the Ancestor Moths. Each moth carries the fjyron of an ancestor's spirit. Loosely translated as the \"will to peace,\" the fjyron can be sung into the silk produced by the Ancestor Moths. When the silk is in turn spun into cloth and embroidered with the genealogy of the correct ancestor, clothing of wondrous power can be made.\n"
"\n"
"Adepts of our order are gifted with prescient powers. The wisdom of the ancestors can sing the future into the present. For this reason, our order and our order alone has been given the privilege to interpret the Elder Scrolls. These writings exceed even the gods, both Aedra and Daedra. Such insight into the inner fabric of reality comes at a price. Each reading of the Elder Scrolls is more profound than the last. Each leaves the priest blind for longer and longer periods of time. Finally, the last reading achieves a nearly sublime understanding of that scroll's contents, but the priest is left permanently blinded to the light of this world. No longer can he read the scrolls.\n"
"\n"
"This monastery is dedicated to the service of these noble members of our order. They now live out their lives with the Ancestor Moths that they so love. Their underground demesnes are well suited to the moths. They raise and nurture the fragile creatures, singing to them constantly. They harvest the silk and spin it into bolts of cloth. They weave the cloth, embroidering it with the genealogies and histories of the ancestors that spun the silk. This is their new life.\n"

"\n"
"The Ayleids, or Heartland High Elves, ruled Cyrodiil in the long ages of Myth before the beginning of recorded history. One of the earliest recorded dates, in fact, is the Fall of White-Gold Tower in 1E 243, which is commonly assumed to mark the end of the Ayleids.\n"
"\n"
"Although Ayleid rule over Cyrodiil was broken in 1E 243, this was only one of the most obvious stages near the end of a long decline. The first two centuries of the First Era saw increasing strife between the great Ayleid lords of Cyrodiil. Alessia appears to have taken advantage of a period of civil war to launch her uprising. Imperial historians have traditionally attributed her victory to intervention from Skyrim, but it appears she had at least as much help from rebel Ayleid lords during the siege of White-Gold Tower.\n"
"\n"
"The popular image of the Ayleids as brutal slavemasters is based in fact, of course, but it is less well-known that a number of Ayleid princes continued to rule parts of Cyrodiil after 243 as vassals of the new Empress of Cyrodiil. This suggests either that Ayleid rule was not universally detested or that Alessia and her successors were more pragmatic than is traditionally believed (or perhaps some of both).\n"
"\n"
"In any event, excavations at a number of Ayleid sites show continued occupation and even expansion during the so-called Late Ayleid Period (1E 243 to c. 498). At first, many Ayleid lords continued to rule as vassals of the new human regime. In some cases, Ayleid supporters of Alessia were even rewarded with new lands taken from slain enemies. It is not clear to what extent human slavery continued under the Cyrodilic Empire. Humans continued to dwell in the Ayleid-ruled areas of Cyrodiil, but there is nothing definitive to show under what terms.\n"
"\n"
"This was an uneasy relationship from the beginning, and it was not destined to last long. Resentment at the continued presence of Ayleid nobles within the Empire was a contributing factor to the rise of the so-called Alessian Order founded by Maruhk. The first victims of the Alessians were the Ayleids of Cyrodiil. In the early 300s, the surviving Ayleid communities in human-ruled areas were obliterated one by one. The refugees temporarily swelled the power of the remaining Ayleid lordships.\n"
"\n"
"Then in 361, the Alessians gained control of the Empire and enforced the Alessian Doctrines throughout its domain. The Ayleid lordships were abolished. Enforcement of this decree does not appear to have required much direct violence. It seems that by this point the balance of power was so overwhelmingly against them and their fate so long foreshadowed that most of the remaining Ayleids simply left Cyrodiil, eventually being absorbed into the Elven populations of Valenwood and High Rock. Indeed, the rise of the Direnni Hegemony may be linked to this exodus of Ayleids from Cyrodiil (a connection so far studied very little by historians).\n"
"\n"
"Still, a remnant Ayleid population seems to have survived the rule of the Alessians, because we've heard of \"the last king of the Ayleids\" joining the battle of Glenumbria Moors, where the Dirennis decisively defeated the Alessians in 482. How this king's people survived the preceding century is unknown. We do not even know who they were, although recent research points to Nenalata as the possible resting place of this \"last king.\" Unfortunately, in the current state of the Empire, funds are no longer available for proper scientific investigation of such extensive ruins, so the answer to these questions will have to be left to future generations."

"\n"
"In the first years of the First Era, a powerful race of Elves called the Ayleids, or the Heartland High Elves, ruled central Tamriel with an iron hand. The high and haughty Ayleids relied on their patrons, the treacherous Daedra Lords, to provide armies of Daedra and dead spirits. With these fearless magical armies, the Ayleids preyed without mercy upon the young races of men, slaughtering or enslaving them at their whim.\n"
"\n"
"On behalf of the suffering human races, St. Alessia, the first in the line of Cyrodiils, sought the aid of Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time, and ruler of the noble Aedra. Akatosh, looking with pity upon the plight of men, drew precious blood from his own heart, blessed St. Alessia with this blood of Dragons, and made a Covenant: so long as Alessia's generations were true to the dragon blood, Akatosh would endeavor to seal tight the Gates of Oblivion and deny the armies of Daedra and undead to their enemies, the Daedra-loving Ayleids.\n"
"\n"
"In token of this Covenant, Akatosh gave to Alessia and her descendants the Amulet of Kings and the Eternal Dragonfires of the Imperial City. Thus does Alessia become the first gem in the Cyrodilic Amulet of Kings. The gem is the Red Diamond in the middle of the Amulet. This is the Symbol of the Empire, surrounded by eight other gems, one for each of the Divines.\n"
"\n"
"So long as the Empire shall maintain its worship of Akatosh and his kin, and so long as Alessia's heirs shall bear the Amulet of Kings, Akatosh and his divine kin maintain a strong barrier between Tamriel and Oblivion, so that mortal man need never again fear the devastating summoned hosts of the Daedra Lords.\n"
"\n"
"If the Empire should slacken in its dedication to the Eight Divines, or if the blood of Alessia's heirs should fail, then shall the barriers between Tamriel and the Daedric realms fall, and Daedra-worshipers might summon lesser Daedra and undead spirits to trouble the races of men."

"첫번째 연대의 첫해에, 에일리드(Ayleids), 혹은 하트랜드 하이 엘프(the Heartland High Elves) 라고 불리우는 강력한 엘프들은 가혹하게 중앙 탐리엘지역을 통치했었다. 상류층인 도도한 에일리드들은 그들에게 데드라와 데드 스피릿의 군대를 제공해 주는 믿을수 없는 후원자인 데드라 로드들에게 의존하고 있었다; 이 두려움 없는 마법의 군대들을 이용하여 에일리드들은 인간종족에게 자비심없이 즉흥적으로 그들을 학살하고 노예로 만들었다.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"고통받는 인간종족을 대신하여, 성자 알레시아(St. Alessia)는 시로딜의 경계안에서 처음으로, 시간의 드래곤을 수호하는 자(the Dragon God of Time)이며, 노블 에이드라(noble Aedra)의 통치자인,아카토쉬(Akatosh)의 도움을 구했다. 인간의 비참함을 가엾게 바라보던 아카토쉬는 자신의 심장으로부터 소중한 피를 떨어뜨려, 이 드래곤의 피로써 성자 알레시아를 축복했다. 그리고 알레시아의 자손들은 오랫동안 드래곤의 피를 충실히 섬기겠다는 맹세를 하게 하였다. 아카토쉬는 오블리비언의 게이트들을 단단히 봉인하고, 인간들의 적이며 데이드라에 우호적인 에일리드들에게 데드라와 언데드의 군대가 공급되는 것을 차단했다. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"이 맹세에 의해서 아카토쉬는 알레시아와 그녀의 신도들에게 왕들의 아뮬렛과 임페리얼 시티의 영원한 드래곤파이어들을 주었다. 그리고 알레시아는 시로딜에서 왕들의 아뮬렛으로 첫번째 보석이 되었다. 이 보석은 아뮬렛의 중앙에 붉은 다이아몬드가 있다. 이것은 제국의 상징이며, 후에 셉팀가의 상징이 되었다. 이것은 여덟개의 다른 보석들에 둘러싸여있으며, 각각의 보석은 각각의 신들을 위한 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"오랫동안 제국은 아카토쉬와 그 동족을 숭배해왔고, 알레시아의 자손들은 왕들의 아뮬렛을 책임져왔다. 아카토쉬와 그의 동족 신들은 탐리엘과 오블리비언 사이에 강력한 장벽을 유지해주었다. 그래서 인간은 결코 다시는 데이드라 로드들의 파괴적인 소환물들을 두려워할 필요가 없었다.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"그러나 만약 제국이 여덟 디바인들에게 헌신을 소홀히 하거나, 혹은 알레시아의 자손들이 실패해서, 탐리엘과 데드릭 왕국 사이의 장벽들이 무너지게 된다면, 데이드라 숭배자들은 모든 자들에게 고통을 안겨주는 데이드라와 언데드,그리고 영혼들을 소환하게 될 것이다.\n"

"(Editor's Note: The Adabal-a is traditionally believed to be the memoirs of Morihaus, consort to Alessia the Slave Queen. While this cannot be historically verified, the Adabal-a is certainly among the oldest written accounts to come down to us from the early First Era.)\n"

"Pelinal's Death\n"
"\n"
"And in the blood-floored throne room of White-Gold, the severed head of Pelinal spoke to the winged-bull, Morihaus, demigod lover of Al-Esh, saying, \"Our enemies have undone me, and spread my body into hiding. In mockery of divine purpose, the Ayleids cut me into eighths, for they are obsessed with this number.\"\n"
"\n"
"And Morihaus, confused, snorted through his ring, saying, \"Your crusades went beyond her counsel, Whitestrake, but I am a bull, and therefore reckless in my wit. I think I would go and gore our prisoners if you had left any alive. You are blood-made-glorious, uncle, and will come again, as fox animal or light. Cyrod is still ours.\"\n"
"\n"
"Then Pelinal spoke again for the last time: \"Beware, Morihaus, beware! With the foresight of death I know now that my foe yet lives, bitter knowledge to take to my grave. Better that I had died believing myself the victor. Although cast beyond the doors of night, he will return. Be vigilant! I can no longer shield the host of Men from Umaril's retribution.\"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Alessia's Youth During the Slave-Years\n"
"\n"
"Perrif's original tribe is unknown, but she grew up in Sard, anon Sardarvar Leed, where the Ayleids herded in men from across all the Niben: kothri, nede, al-gemha, men-of-'kreath (though these were later known to be imported from the North), keptu, men-of-ge (who were eventually destroyed when the Flower King Nilichi made great sacrifice to an insect god named ((lost))), al-hared, men-of-ket, others; but this was Cyrod, the heart of the imperatum saliache, where men knew no freedom, even to keep family, or choice of name except in secret, and so to their alien masters all of these designations were irrelevant.\n"
"\n"
"Men were given over to the lifting of stones, and the draining of the fields, and the upkeep of temple and road; or to become art-tortures for strange pleasures, as in the wailing wheels of Vindasel and the gut-gardens of Sercen; and flesh-sculpture, which was everywhere among the slaves of the Ayleids in those days; or, worse, the realms of the Fire King Hadhuul, where the begetting of drugs drawn from the admixture of daedrons into living hosts let one inhale new visions of torment, and children were set aflame for nighttime tiger sport.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Morihaus Explains Alessia's Names\n"
"\n"
"Then Morihaus said to them: \"In your tales you have many names for her: Al-Esh, given to her in awe, that when translated sounds like a redundancy, 'the high high,' from which come the more familiar corruptions: Aleshut, Esha, Alessia. You knew her as Paravant, given to her when crowned, 'first of its kind,' by which the gods meant a mortal worthy of the majesty that is killing-questing-healing, which is also Paraval, Pevesh, Perrethu, Perrif, and, in my case, for it is what I called her when we were lovers: Paravania.\n"
"\n"
"\"Though she is gone to me, she remains bathed in stars, first Empress, Lady of Heaven, Queen-ut-Cyrod.\"\n"
"\n"
"And they considered themselves full-answered and departed."

"By Quintus Nerevelus\n"
"Former Imperial Librarian\n"
"\n"
"After the supposed theft of an Elder Scroll from our Imperial Library, I endeavored to find any sort of index or catalogue of the Scrolls in our possession so that such situations may be avoided (or at least properly verified) in the future. To my dismay, I discovered that the Moth Priests are notoriously inexact when it comes to the actual physical manifestations of the Scrolls, and had no idea how many they held, or how they were organized. Merely asking the question evoked chuckles, as if a child was asking why dogs cannot talk.\n"
"\n"
"I will confess, my jealousy of the ones who can read the Scrolls grows, but I am not yet willing to sacrifice my sight to alleged knowledge. The older Moth Priests I attempt to engage in conversation seem as batty as any other elder who has lost their mind, so I fail to see what wisdom is imparted from the reading.\n"
"\n"
"In any case, I set out to create my own index of the Elder Scrolls, in cooperation with the monks. Day by day, we went through the tower halls, with them telling me the general nature of each Elder Scroll so that I might record its location. Always careful never to glimpse the writings myself, I had only their word to go on. I meticulously drew out a map of the chambers, where Scrolls relating to various specific prophecies were located, where particular periods of history were housed. In all, it took nearly a year of plodding, but at last I had rough notes on the entirety of the library to begin my collation.\n"
"\n"
"It was here that things began to go amiss. In studying my notes, I found many areas of overlap and outright contradiction. In some cases different monks would claim the same scroll to be at opposite ends of the tower. I know they have no taste for jesting, or else I would suspect I was being made the fool in some game of theirs.\n"
"\n"
"I spoke to one of the older monks to relate my concerns, and he hung his head in sorrow for my wasted time. \"Did I not tell you,\" he coughed, \"when you started this that all efforts would be futile? The Scrolls do not exist in countable form.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I had thought you meant there were too many to be counted.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"There are, but that is not the least of their complexities. Turn to the repository behind you, and tell me how many Scrolls are locked therein.\"\n"
"\n"
"I ran my fingers over the metal casings, tallying each rounded edge that they encountered. I turned back. \"Fourteen,\" I said.\n"
"\n"
"\"Hand me the eighth one,\" he said, reaching out his hand.\n"
"\n"
"I guided the cylinder into his palm, and he gave a slight nod to acknowledge it. \"Now, count again.\"\n"
"\n"
"Humoring him, I again passed my hands over the Scrolls, but could not believe what I was feeling.\n"
"\n"
"\"Now … now there are eighteen!\" I gasped.\n"
"\n"
"The old monk chuckled, his cheeks pushing up his blindfold until it folded over itself. \"And in fact,\" he said, \"there always were.\"\n"
"\n"
"It was then that I enrolled as the oldest novice ever accepted into the Cult of the Ancestor Moth."
