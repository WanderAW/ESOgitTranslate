"Little boys shouldn't summon up the forces of eternal darkness unless they have an adult supervising, I know, I know. But on that sunny night on the 5th of First Seed, I didn't want an adult. I wanted Hermaeus Mora, the Daedra of knowledge, learning, gums, and varnishes. You see, I was told by a beautiful, large-breasted man who lived under the library in my home town that the 5th of First Seed was Hermaeus Mora's night. And if I wanted the Oghma Infinium, the Book of Knowledge, I had to summon him. When you're the new King of Solitude, every bit of knowledge helps.\n"
"\n"
"Normally, you need a witches coven, or a mages guild, or at least matching pillow case and sheets to invoke a prince of Oblivion. The Man Under the Library showed me how to do it myself. He told me to wait until the storm was at its height before shaving the cat. I've forgotten the rest of the ceremony. It doesn't matter.\n"
"\n"
"Someone appeared who I thought was Hermaeus Mora. The only thing that made me somewhat suspicious was Hermaeus Mora, from what I read, was a big blobby multi-eyed clawed monstrosity, and this guy looked like a waistcoated banker. Also, he kept calling himself Sheogorath, not Hermaeus Mora. Still, I was so happy to have successfully summoned Hermaeus Mora, these inconsistencies did not bother me. He had me do some things that didn't make any sense to me (beyond the mortal scope, breadth, and ken, I suppose), and then his servant happily gave me something he called the Wabbajack. Wabbajack. Wabbajack.\n"
"\n"
"Wabbajack.\n"
"\n"
"Wabbajack. Wabbajack. Wabbajack. Wabbajack. Wabbajack. Wabbajack.\n"
"\n"
"Maybe the Wabbajack is the Book of Knowledge. Maybe I'm smarter because I know cats can be bats can be rats can be hats can be gnats can be thats can be thises. And that doors can be boars can be snores can be floors can be roars can be spores can be yours can be mine. I must be smart, for the interconnective system is very clear to me. Then why or wherefore do people keep calling me mad?\n"

"Crow and Raven were watching Cormorant dive for fish. \"I wish I could dive,\" said Crow. \"I like to eat fish.\" \"What?\" said Raven. \"Are you saying Cormorant can do something that you cannot? That's absurd. You're twice the bird Cormorant is.\" \"You're right!\" said Crow, and he dove deep into the water. Half a minute later he thrashed his way back to the surface. Raven stood nearby. \"Raven!\" gasped Crow. \"Why did you say that? I nearly drowned!\" Raven shrugged and said, \"I like to eat birds.\"\n"

Now I know where it is.\" \"Eggs for lunch!\" said Raven.\n"

If you drink the rest of the ale in his mug, you'll get a shiny pin, too.\" \"Shiny pin!\" said Crow. He flew down to the table, drank the rest of the ale, and then fell over and couldn't get up. Raven flew down and plucked the pin from the drover's shirt. \"Shiny pin!\" she said, and flew off."

"Hircine's Tale\n"
"\n"
"Ever proud and boastful, Oblivion's Mad Prince stood one fifth day of mid year among the frigid peaks of Skyrim, and beckoned forth Hircine for parlay. The Huntsman God materialized, for this was his day, and the boldness of Sheogorath intrigued him.\n"
"\n"
"Wry without equal, Sheogorath holds in his realm giggling loons, flamboyant auteurs, and craven mutilators. The Mad Prince will ply profitless bargains and promote senseless bloodshed for nothing more than the joy of another's confusion, tragedy, or rage. So it was that Sheogorath had set a stage on which to play himself as rival to Hircine.\n"
"\n"
"Without haste, the coy Prince proffered his contest; each Prince was to groom a beast to meet at this place again, three years to the hour, and do fatal battle. Expressionless behind his fearsome countenance, Hircine agreed, and with naught but a dusting of snow in the drift, the Princes were gone to their realms.\n"
"\n"
"Confident, but knowing Sheogorath for a trickster, Hircine secretly bred an abomination in his hidden realm. An ancient Daedroth he summoned, and imbued it with the foul curse of lycanthropy. Of pitch heart and jagged fang, the unspeakable horror had no peer, even among the great hunters of Hircine's sphere.\n"
"\n"
"In the third year, on the given day, Hircine returned, where Sheogorath leaned, cross-legged on a stone, whistling with idle patience. The Prince of the Hunt struck his spear to the ground, bringing forth his unnatural, snarling behemoth. Doffing his cap, sly as ever, Sheogorath stood and stepped aside to reveal a tiny, colorful bird perched atop the stone. Demurely it chirped in the bristling gusts, scarcely audible.\n"
"\n"
"In a twisted, springing heap, the Daedroth was upon the stone, leaving only rubble where the boulder had been. Thinking itself victorious, the monster's bloodied maw curled into a mock grin, when a subdued song drifted in the crisp air. The tiny bird lightly hopped along the snout of the furious Daedroth. Sheogorath looked on, quietly mirthful, as the diminutive creature picked at a bit of detritus caught in scales betwixt the fiery eyes of the larger beast. With howling fury, the were-thing blinded itself trying to pluck away the nuisance. And so it continued for hours, Hircine looking on in shame while his finest beast gradually destroyed itself in pursuit of the seemingly oblivious bird, all the while chirping a mournful tune to the lonesome range.\n"
"\n"
"Livid, but beaten, Hircine burned the ragged corpse and withdrew to his realm, swearing in forgotten tongues. His curses still hang in those peaks, and no wayfarer tarries for fear of his wrathful aspect in those obscured heights.\n"
"\n"
"Turning on his heel, Sheogorath beckoned the minuscule songbird to perch atop his shoulder, and strolled down the mountain, making for the warm breezes and vibrant sunsets of the Abecean coast, whistling in tune with the tiniest champion in Tamriel."

" 긍지있고 과시하기 좋아하는,6월의 다섯번째날 몹시 추운 스카이림 꼭대기에서 오블리비언의 광기의 프린스는,허씬에게 말을걸며 손짓으로 불렀다. 이날이 자신의 날이었으므로, 사냥꾼의 신은 형체를 드러냈고 쉐오고라스가  대담함하게도 그의 흥미를 돋궜다.\n"
"\n"
"찡그린 채로, 쉐오고라스는 그가 그의 왕국이 낄낄대는 바보나 겁많은 훼손자들만 있다는 말을 참으며 정신을 잡았다. 광기의 프린스는 이익없는 거래를 하며, 불필요한 유혈 사태를 조장하여 다른 이의 이유없는 혼란이나 비극, 격노를 위해 촉발시키리라 다짐하였다. 그리하여 쉐오고라스는 허씬의 경쟁자가 되는 형국에 이르게 된 것이었다.\n"
"\n"
"천천히, 쉐오고라스는 그의 경기를,각각의 프린스는 한마리의 야수를 만들어 이 장소에서 앞으로 3년 후의 같은 시각에 다시 만나 운명의 전투를 하기로, 제안했다. 무시무시한 속내를 감춘 허씬은 표정없이 동의했다. 그리고 무가치하지만 눈보라를 뿌리는 대결을 뒤로하고 프린스들은 각자의 왕국으로 돌아갔다.\n"
"\n"
"허씬은 자신감에 차있었지만, 쉐오고라스가 사기꾼인 것을 알아 조심스럽게 자신의 숨겨진 왕국에서 증오를 키웠다. 그가 소환한 고대의 데이드로스 (Daedroth)는 더러운 저주로 가득찬 늑대인간이었다. 강한 심장과 날카로운 송곳니를 가진 형언할 수 없는 공포는 대적할 상대가 없었다. 심지어 허씬의 뛰어난 사냥꾼들조차도.\n"
"\n"
"삼년 후 추수 감사절, 허씬은 돌아왔다. 쉐오고라스는 바위 위에서 다리를 꼰채 기대 있었고, 참을성 없이 빈둥대며 휘파람을 불고 있었다. 사냥의 왕자 (허씬)는 그의 창을 바닥에 꽂고 자연법칙에 어긋나는 으르렁거리는 괴수를 그의 앞으로 데려왔다. 모자를 벗으며, 언제나처럼 교활한 쉐오고라스는 일어나 옆으로 비켜섰다. 그곳엔 아주 작은 다채로운 색깔의 새가 앉아 있었다. 얌전히 청어의 목소리처럼 작게 짹짹거리는 소리는 간신히 들릴 정도였다.\n"
"\n"
"뒤틀거리며 돌덩이 위에서 뛰어오른 데이드로스는 그가 있던 자리에 파편만을 남긴 채, 새가 있는 바위쪽으로 뛰어 올랐다. 괴물은 이겼다고 생각하면서 더러운 털복숭이 입으로 조롱하듯 이를 드러내며 웃었다. 정복자의 노래가 공기중으로 또렷이 울렸다. 작은 새는 포악한 데이드로스의 코옆으로 날아올랐다. 쉐오고라스는 조용하고 유쾌하게 작은 생물이 괴물의 비늘로 싸인 눈을 쪼는 장면을 쳐다 보았다. 격분하여 짖으면서, 눈 먼 괴물은 성가신 새를 잡아죽이러 했다. 몇시간이 지난 후에 허씬은 부끄러움에 차, 그의 훌륭한 괴수가 보이지 않는 짹짹거리는 새를 잡기 위해 애를 쓰다가 차츰 망가져 가는 모습을 보았다.\n"
"\n"
"화가 났지만 패배한 허씬은 찢어진 시체를 태우고는 이제는 존재 하지 않는 언어로 욕을 하며 그의 왕국으로 물러났다. 그의 저주는 아직 이 봉우리 ,높이는 그리 높지 않았지만, 에 남아있고 어떤 여행자도 감히 그곳에서 허씬의 분노를 부추기려 하지 않는다.\n"
"\n"
"발길을 돌리며, 쉐오고라스는 지저귀는 작은 새에 어깨에 앉으라고 손짓했다. 그리고 산을 한가로이 내려가며, 아베신 해안 (Abecean coast)의 따뜻한 산들바람과 활기찬 일몰을 만들었다. 그런 그의 어깨 위에선 탐리엘의 가장 작은 챔피언이 아름다운 곡조로 노래를 부르고 있었다."

"Sheogorath Invents Music\n"
"\n"
"In the earliest of days, in a time when the world was still raw, Sheogorath decided to walk amongst the mortals. He donned his guise of Gentleman With a Cane, and moved from place to place without being recognized. After eleven days and eleven nights, Sheogorath decided that life among mortals was even more boring than his otherworldly existence.\n"
"\n"
"\"What can I do to make their lives more interesting?\" he said to himself. At that same moment, a young woman nearby commented wistfully to herself, \"The sounds of the birds are so beautiful.\"\n"
"\n"
"Sheogorath silently agreed with her. Mortals could not make the beautiful and inspired calls of birds. Their voices were wretched and mundane. He could not change the nature of mortals, for that was the purview of other Daedric Princes. However, he could give them tools to make beautiful sounds.\n"
"\n"
"Sheogorath took hold of the petulant woman and ripped her asunder. From her tendons he made lutes. From her skull and arm bones he made a drum. From her bones he made flutes. He presented these gifts to the mortals, and thus Music was born.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Contest of Wills\n"
"\n"
"A mighty wizard named Ravate once walked the Winds of Time to find Lord Sheogorath. His intent was to win a favor from this most capricious of the Daedric Princes. Upon finding Sheogorath, Ravate spoke humbly to him, \"Lord Sheogorath, I beg a favor of you. I would gladly drive a thousand men mad in your name if you would but grant me the greater magical powers.\"\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately for Ravate, Sheogorath was in a playful mood. He proposed a game. \"I will grant your wish, if you are still sane in three days. During that time, I will do my utmost to drive you mad. It shall be great fun.\"\n"
"\n"
"Ravate was not so certain that he liked this new deal. He had been really looking forward to driving a thousand men mad. \"Lord Sheogorath, I regret having disturbed you with my shallow, selfish request. I withdraw my unfortunate plea and will humbly leave this place.\"\n"
"\n"
"Sheogorath just laughed. \"Too late, mighty Ravate. The game is afoot, and you must play.\" Ravate fled, only to find that all exits from the Daedric realm were now sealed. He wandered aimlessly, constantly looking over his shoulder, jumping at every noise. Each moment brought new terror as he waited for Sheogorath to begin.\n"
"\n"
"After three days, Ravate was convinced that every plant and animal was a tool of Sheogorath. He hadn't eaten or drunk for fear that Sheogorath had poisoned the food or drink. He hadn't slept for fear of Sheogorath invading his dreams. (Which was foolish, as dreams are the domain of Vaermina, may She grant us Restful Sleep.)\n"
"\n"
"It was then that Sheogorath appeared to him. Ravate cried out, \"You have set the whole world to watching me! Every creature and plant are doing your bidding to drive me mad.\"\n"
"\n"
"Sheogorath replied, \"Actually, I have done nothing. You have driven yourself mad with your fears. Your delusions prove that you are truly deranged, and therefore I win. While you wanted to make a thousand men mad, I only wanted to break one man's mind, yours.\"\n"
"\n"
"From that day forward Ravate served Sheogorath's every whim. Whenever daring travelers try to approach Sheogorath, Ravate warns them, \"Sheogorath is already inside each of us. You have already lost.\""

"Sheogorath and King Lyandir\n"
"\n"
"King Lyandir was known to be an exceedingly rational man. He lived in a palace that was a small, simple structure, unadorned with art and ugly to look upon. \"I do not need more than this,\" he would say. \"Why spend my gold on such luxuries when I can spend it on my armies or on great public works?\"\n"
"\n"
"His kingdom prospered under his sensible rule. However, the people did not always share the king's sense of practicality. They would build houses that were beautiful to look upon, although not necessarily very practical. They devoted time and energy to works of art. They would celebrate events with lavish festivals. In general, they were quite happy.\n"
"\n"
"King Lyandir was disappointed that more of them did not follow his example and lead frugal, sensible lives. He brooded on this for many years. Finally, he decided that his subjects simply didn't understand how much more they could accomplish if they didn't waste time on those frivolous activities. Perhaps, he reasoned, they just needed more examples.\n"
"\n"
"The king decreed that all new buildings must be simple, unadorned, and no larger than was necessary for their function. The people were not happy about this, but they liked their king and respected the new law. In a few short years, there were more plain buildings than ornate ones. The citizens used the money saved to make and buy even more lavish art and hold even more excessive celebrations.\n"
"\n"
"Once again, King Lyandir decided to provide them a strict example of how beneficial it would be to use their time and resources for more practical purposes. He banned all works of art in the city. The people were quite put out by this, but they knew that their king was doing what he thought was best for them. However, human nature is not so easily denied. In a few more years the city was filled with plain, simple buildings, and devoid of any sort of art. However, the people now had even more money and time to devote to their parties and festivals.\n"
"\n"
"With a heavy heart, King Lyandir decided that his people were to be treated like children. And like all children, they needed rules and discipline laid down by great figures of authority to make them understand what was truly important in life. He decreed that there should be no revelry in the city. Singing, dancing, and music were all banned. Even food and drink were limited to water and simple foodstuffs.\n"
"\n"
"The people had had enough. Revolt was out of the question, since King Lyandir had a very well trained and equipped army. They visited the shrines and temples in droves, praying to all the gods, and even to some of the Daedric Princes, that King Lyandir would revoke these new, oppressive laws.\n"
"\n"
"Sheogorath heard their pleas and decided to visit King Lyandir. He appeared to the king in his dreams as a field of flowers, each with arms instead of petals and the face of the Madgod in the center. \"I am Lord of the Creative and Lord of the Deranged. Since you have no use for my gifts of creativity, I have decided to bless you with an abundance of my other gift.\"\n"
"\n"
"From that day forward, every child born in the city was born into madness. Since infants do not reveal illnesses of the mind, it was several years before this was realized. The king's own son was among the victims, suffering from seizures and delusions. Yet, King Lyandir refused to change his ways.\n"
"\n"
"When his son, Glint, was 12 years old, he stabbed his father while Lyandir was sleeping. With his dying breath, King Lyandir asked, \"Why?\" His son replied, \"It is the most practical thing I could do.\"\n"
"\n"
"The new, young king ordered all the palace servants slaughtered. He ordered a grand festival to celebrate his new reign and the repeal of Lyandir's laws. He served the crowds a stew made from the carcasses of the palace servants. He ordered the east facing walls of every building painted red, and the west facing walls painted in stripes. He decreed that all citizens wear ornate masks on the backs of their heads. He then burned down the palace and began construction of a new one.\n"
"\n"
"In the new palace, the young king ordered his personal chambers to not have any doors; for fear that small woodland creatures would attack him. He ordered that it have no windows for fear that the sun and moon were jealous of him and plotting his death.\n"
"\n"
"And thus ended the line of King Lyandir. The people of the city returned to their grand works of art and raucous celebrations. They talked and acted as if they still had a living king, and even kept up the palace, using it to house and care for their mad children. Sheogorath was mightily pleased with this outcome. From that day forward the city was blessed with more than the normal number of gifted artists and deranged citizens."

"\"Not till the very evening they came,\" answered he, and then told of his dealings with Mehrunes Dagon's thralls, saying that Mackkan would find it easier to whistle on the wind's tracks and go on a fool's errand than to fight his toads. Then said Mackkan:\n"

"And stick to thy parts and thy pride;\n"
"Or this mallet of mine, Malacath's Scourge,\n"
"Will meet with thine ear of a surety.\n"

"EXPLICATION: The mace Scourge, Blessed of Malacath, Mackkan's legendary weapon, forged from sacred ebony in the Fountains of Fickledire, has ever been the bane of the Dark Kin, and many a black spirit has been hurled back into Oblivion with a single blow of this bold defender of the friendless."

"Sotha Sil and the Scribs\n"
"\n"
"Young Sotha Sil, while playing in the egg mines, saw a number of scribs in a deep shaft, and he began to cast stones upon them, snickering as they skittered and scattered, until one of the scribs, lifting its head up in agony, cried out to Sotha Sil: \"Please, please, have mercy, little boy, for what is sport to you is suffering and death to us.\"\n"
"\n"
"And so Sotha Sil discovered that the idle amusements of one may be the solemn tortures of another.\n"

"Lord Vivec and the Contentious Beasts\n"
"\n"
"A shalk and a kagouti were strutting back and forth in a foyada, casting aspersions on one another's looks. \"You are the ugliest creature alive,\" the shalk told the kagouti. \"No, YOU are the ugliest creature alive,\" the kagouti told the shalk. For each thought himself most handsome, and the other most ugly.\n"
"\n"
"Then Lord Vivec chanced by, and settled their dispute. \"No, you BOTH are the ugliest creatures alive, and I will not have my pleasant sojourn spoiled by your unseemly squabbling.\" So he dealt them both mighty blows, shattering their skulls, and silencing their argument, and went merrily upon his way.\n"
"\n"
"And thus Lord Vivec proved that ugliness is as much in one's manner as in one's appearance.\n"
"\n"
"The Boiled Kagouti\n"
"\n"
"It is said that if a kagouti steps into a boiling pool, he will leap out immediately to avoid harm.\n"
"\n"
"But if the kagouti is standing in a pool, and a wizard slowly raises the temperature, measure by measure, to boiling, the kagouti will calmly stand in place until he is boiled.\n"
"\n"
"Thus we see that we must be alert not only to the obvious danger, but also to the subtle degrees by which change may result in danger.\n"
"\n"
"The Dubious Healer\n"
"\n"
"Once upon a time, a Telvanni issued forth from his tower and proclaimed to all the world that he was a mighty and learned healer, master of all alchemy and potions, and able to cure all diseases.\n"
"\n"
"Lord Vivec looked upon this wizard, and listened to his boasting, then asked him, \"How can you pretend to prescribe for others the cure to all diseases, when you are unable to cure yourself of your own manifest arrogance and foolishness?\"\n"
"\n"
"The Guar and the Mudcrabs\n"
"\n"
"The Guar were so tormented by the other creatures they did not know where to go. As soon as they saw a single beast approach them, off they dashed in terror.\n"
"\n"
"One day they saw a pack of Nix-hounds ranging about, and in a desperate panic all the Guar scuttled off towards the sea, determined to drown themselves rather than live in such a continual state of fear. But just as they got near the shoreline, a colony of Mudcrabs, frightened in their turn by the approach of the Guar, scuttled off, and threw themselves into the water.\n"
"\n"
"\"Truly,\" said one of the Guar, \"things are not so bad as they seem. For there is always someone worse off than you.\"\n"
"\n"
"The Wounded Netch\n"
"\n"
"A wounded Netch lay himself down in a quiet corner of his feeding-ground. His healthy companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health, yet each one helped himself to a share of the fodder which had been placed there for his use; so that the poor Netch died, not from his wounds, but from the greed and carelessness of his erstwhile friends.\n"
"\n"
"And so it is clear that thoughtless companions may bring more harm than help."
