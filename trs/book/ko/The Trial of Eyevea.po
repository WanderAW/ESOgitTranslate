"A rich Breton named Robier, often called \"Uncle\" by his neighbors, owned a great plantation whose crops fed dozens of villages. Day and night his serfs worked the fields, plucking aphids and worms out by their fingernails if they had to in order to make the produce the best and most delicious in all of High Rock.\n"
"\n"
"Then the Creature invaded his fields. Beneath the noses of the workers, it devoured potatoes and cabbages, carrots and lettuce, radishes and beans.\n"
"\n"
"It stumped the efforts of the serfs to catch it. Sometimes, people would think they had it, dive forward to grab it, and impale themselves on tools left upon the ground! Other times, the Creature would sneak up behind them in broad daylight and push them over to break their necks! \n"
"\n"
"It was believed that Uncle Robier was cursed somehow, and the Creature was some kind of revenge for a person he had wronged in his past. The serfs abandoned the fields, willing to risk a week in the stocks rather than death at the hands of the Creature.\n"
"\n"
"Soon Uncle Robier's fields were stripped bare by the ravenous Creature, and even he began to believe the superstition himself. He locked himself in his chateau and pleaded to the Divines, but they were silent. All Robier could hear was the sound of the Creature scratching beneath the floorboards, inside the walls, and in his cupboards as it devoured all he had left to eat.\n"
"\n"
"Huddled inside his bedroom in the dark of night, Robier watched as his last candle burned itself to a nub and went out. Then the Creature devoured him as well."

"A little boy, scion of a wealthy house, once went to the lake shore with his parents on holiday. While the elders sipped wine in a cabin with their snooty fellows, the boy was left to play in the sand and mud. He was terribly sad at being so scorned, and went searching for a friend.\n"
"\n"
"The boy did not have to search long. He found a wonderfully chatty duck in the reeds who told him stories of places the boy could only dream of. Though he was quickly enchanted by the tales, the boy became melancholy that he would never see such a place with his own eyes. The duck laughed and told him that this was not so! They would build one together!\n"
"\n"
"The boy and the duck waded out to a small island on the lake and together they built a tiny house of sticks and sand. This sufficed for an hour, until the duck suggested that a house was not a fitting place for the boy. He deserved a palace! The mortar of mud would not be enough, but one of the adults might help.\n"
"\n"
"The boy went back to the cabin and found a noble who had stepped outside to relieve himself, so inebriated he was. He was easily coaxed into following the boy back to the island, where the duck leapt and tore out his throat to use blood and flesh for the mortar and bones for the beams. The boy was delighted, but the palace had to be bigger!\n"
"\n"
"Back he went, again and again, to collect the drunken folk to show them the magnificent palace. Again and again the duck added their bits to the wondrous palace, whose spires and arches dried to become alabaster and gold.\n"
"\n"
"When the boy's parents came to collect him, he took them to see his magnificent palace out on the lake. They screamed and screamed and ran, leaving the boy alone with the duck. He was not sad! Together they made merry on the island until the mists closed in around it and spirited it away to a land of cheer and mirth for all time."

"부잣집에 사는 한 어린 소년이 휴일에 부모님과 함께 호숫가에 갔다. 어른들이 오두막에서 오만한 친구들과 포도주를 마시는 동안, 소년은 흙장난이라도 하라면서 쫓겨났다. 소년은 무시당한 게 슬퍼서 친구를 찾아 돌아다녔다.\n"
"\n"
"오래 지나지 않아 소년은 갈대 사이에서 신비한 수다쟁이 오리 한 마리를 찾아냈다. 오리는 소년에게 오로지 꿈 같은 장소에 대해 이야기해 주었다. 소년은 그 이야기에 금세 매료되었지만, 그 곳을 두 눈으로 직접 볼 수 없다는 생각에 우울해졌다. 오리는 웃으면서 말했다. 그렇지 않아! 같이 집을 만들자!\n"
"\n"
"소년과 오리는 호수에 있는 작은 섬으로 가 막대기와 모래로 작은 집을 지었다. 한 시간이 지나자 오리가 말했다. 너한테 이런 집은 어울리지 않아. 궁전이 더 어울려! 진흙 반죽이 별로 없지만, 어른들이 도와줄 수 있을 거야.\n"
"\n"
"소년이 오두막으로 돌아오자, 귀족 한 사람이 밖으로 나와 볼일을 보고 있었다. 그는 술에 취해 있어서 소년의 말을 듣고 순순히 섬으로 따라왔다. 그러자 오리가 뛰어올라 남자의 목을 잡아뜯었고, 그 피와 살을 회반죽과 기둥으로 사용했다. 소년은 기뻐했지만 궁전은 더 커야 했다!\n"
"\n"
"소년은 취한 사람들에게 웅장한 궁전을 보여주기 위해 여러 번 되돌아갔다. 오리는 사람들의 살점을 반복해서 궁전에 덧발랐다. 이윽고 첨탑과 아치가 말라서 석고와 황금으로 변했다.\n"
"\n"
"소년의 부모님이 그를 데리러 오자, 소년은 그들을 호수로 데려가 자신의 아름다운 궁전을 보여주었다. 그들은 소년과 오리를 남겨둔 채 끝없이 비명을 지르며 달아났다. 소년은 슬퍼하지 않았다! 그들은 섬에서 즐겁게 놀았다. 이윽고 안개가 주위를 둘러싸더니 섬을 언제까지나 즐겁고 활기찬 곳으로 끌고 갔다."
