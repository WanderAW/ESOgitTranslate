"High Councilor Meriath,\n"
"\n"
"I have completed an extensive audit of our ongoing business association with the Hlaalu Construction Syndic. While it is true that they provided us with much needed labor and resources, and it was certainly advantageous from a fiscal point of view due to their surprisingly (and now suspiciously) low bid for the contract, I have uncovered a number of disquieting consequences as a result of this continuing relationship.\n"
"\n"
"As far as the construction of the towns of Suran and Balmora, aside from the garish use of Hlaalu architecture when the contract clearly called for the utilization of a more dignified Redoran design, they did complete the work on time and on budget. However, we inadvertently provided them with a foothold beyond Seyda Neen. This, in turn, has enabled them to establish business relations with all sources of raw materials and provisions throughout Vvardenfell, giving House Hlaalu a near-monopoly in these areas. Much of House Redoran now buys all of its local goods through Hlaalu aggregators!\n"
"\n"
"Moreover, House Hlaalu continues to expand its influence in both towns, much to the chagrin of our regional councilors. It's clear they have their eyes on these strategic locations, and I fear that they know how to conquer us through business while we instead remain vigilant against more militaristic overtures.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, I fear that in retrospect, we should never have entered into this deal with House Hlaalu. In the long run, we may have saved time and gold only to have lost the territory we so desperately require.\n"

"By Barilzar, Mage of the Seventh Order and Artificer Extraordinaire\n"
"\n"
"I studied at the feet of the Father of Mysteries. I learned of magic and machines from the Clockwork God. I searched for the secrets of Oblivion with the Inspiration of Craft and Sorcery. I did all this and more with the Light of Knowledge, the SI in ALMSIVI, the Wizard-Mystic of the Tribunal—Sotha Sil.\n"
"\n"
"As student and disciple, I spent many long years at the Magus's side, helping to maintain and expand his ultimate creation, the Clockwork City. Now, rumors and stories and exaggerations galore persist about the fabled complex. The purpose of this book is to neither confirm nor deny these tales. Instead, I plan to add to the mystery and the extraordinary wonder of the place. Hopefully, my old master will approve.\n"
"\n"
"Let's start with a few basic turns of the gear as I reveal a secret but wrap it in a mystery. The Clockwork City is a giant complex the size of a world, but it fits inside a glass dome no larger than a good-sized netch. Here's another contradiction. Sotha Sil was definitely inspired by the technology of the Dwemer, but the brass tunnels, giant gears, electrical fountains, and lightning falls are all uniquely the creation of the Magus of the Three. Finally, while it is said that the Clockwork City is a painstaking recreation of Nirn itself, quite the opposite is potentially true. The complex is the perfection of Nirn as imagined by the Clockwork God.\n"
"\n"
"I spent much of my apprenticeship adjusting cogs and regulating the flow of energy, but my happiest memories consist of tinkering in one of Sotha Sil's many workshops, fabricantoriums, and ateliers (which is just a fancier way to say workshop, but the Magus loved to play with obscure words almost as much as the Warrior-Poet). I loved participating in the endless and varied experiments that were constantly being performed throughout the city. We studied everything, always looking for a new theory to test or a device to improve. \"We build it because we can,\" Sotha Sil told me, but what I heard him say was \"We build it because it's fun.\"\n"
"\n"
"Here's another mystery to ponder. You must humble yourself and become modest to enter the Clockwork City. Indeed, there's no room inside for anything larger than a shroom-beetle, but once you gain entry it's larger than anyone could ever fully explore. Contemplate that while the gears turn, I dare you!\n"
"\n"
"The city has residents, as any city should. Some, like the fabricants, were specifically created to fulfill necessary roles. But others live within the complex as well. Sotha Sil's current students and disciples wander the brass tunnels, maintaining the endless series of experiments that require monitoring and constant minute adjustments. There are also those the Magus invited to become part of one experiment or another, as well as the extraneous cast-offs, lost travelers, and trapped planar explorers. I've had some of the most interesting conversations ever with those I met in the Clockwork City.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, you have probably heard that Sotha Sil can \"forge the future\" using the Clockwork City. Certainly, the contrivances that spring from this well of invention will one day beat the world into a shape most pleasing to the Father of Mysteries. Beyond that, I cannot say. It is also said that the Clockwork City can be used to \"reshape the world.\" I won't reveal the meaning of that cryptic phrase, but I will confirm that those pistons pump true.\n"
"\n"
"Now I have my own experiments to return to. There's never enough time in the day!"

"High Councilor Meriath,\n"
"\n"
"I want to once again appeal to you and the Redoran Council concerning the status and disposition of the mercenary band known as Ferhara's Warclaws. I urge you to grant me the funds and authority to employ these professional warriors to permanently bolster our forces in and around Balmora. I know that you and Councilor Eris believe that Redoran soldiers are capable of protecting House interests and I agree. But with the continuing need for soldiers in the Ebonheart Pact, I find my resources dangerously limited when it comes to dealing with Daedric cultists, Ashlanders, and other threats to Redoran prosperity.\n"
"\n"
"Allow me to remind you of Ferhara and her impressive qualifications.\n"
"\n"
"Ferhara, a Khajiit warrior who earned prestige and a reputation as a military strategist fighting on the side of the Dominion in the Three Banners War. After serving with honor for two tours of duty, she gathered a band of trusted comrades-in-arms and decided to sell her skills to the highest bidder. Her mercenary band grew and made a name for itself as it worked for merchant lords and nobles from Elsweyr to Morrowind. They originally came to Vvardenfell at the behest of House Hlaalu before we were able to secure their services for House Redoran.\n"
"\n"
"Now Ferhara's Warclaws—an elite band of Khajiit warriors loyal to Ferhara and whoever holds their contract—work for me to promote Redoran interests. Their work in regards to the Ashlanders, for example, demonstrates the importance of keeping these mercenaries loyal to our House. I hope you will agree. I look forward to discussing this in more detail at the next meeting of the council so that we can move forward with a new and more expansive contract.\n"

"By Hassayd the Red\n"
"\n"
"I remember the first test of my sword arm vividly. I was eight and the blade unfamiliar. A dark, barbed thing that I pried from the ashen hand of a dying Dark Elf at my feet as he struggled to keep his eyes open and his fist closed. I did not understand the curse that rattled from his lips as the sword slipped from his grasp. Nearly as long as I was tall, I struggled more to heft that sword than to wrestle it from the slaver who had raised it to my throat moments before.\n"
"\n"
"He had been surprised by our resistance. They all were. We were three forgettable souls on a simple barge of sundries. Easy prey for the dozen armed thugs who overtook our tiny ship, or so they thought. My mother and father were not warriors by trade, but they carried with them the sword-arts of our ancestors. A proud tradition I was meant to carry on, though not this early in my youth. Before that day I had only crossed blunt driftwood spars with my parents. Whether it was eagerness to test myself or fear for the lives of my parents that drove me to take up the sword, I found myself undeterred by my unwieldy grip as I leapt into the fray with the immortal confidence of ignorance. Like a log on the tide, I was swept away with the melee, invisible and underfoot.\n"
"\n"
"First blood was drawn by a chop that was more stumble than swing. I brought the ugly Dark Elf blade down on the nearest slaver, struck him squarely in the back, and split his spine like a log. His body went slack in an instant and nearly pulled me overboard as he pitched over the lip of our barge. It felt to me as if time had stopped as the blade came free, wet with the blood of my enemy and glistening like the fang of a great spider, its dark metal robbing the gore of its vivid color. As I pried my gaze from the ghastly weapon, I caught my mother's eye from across the deck. The look she gave me was a mix of pride and remorse. I could have spent an eternity hanging on that moment, but the crash of my victim's corpse into the sea shook me from my grim reverie just in time to realize my attack had not gone unnoticed.\n"
"\n"
"I had thought myself brave, but when faced with a pair of vicious slavers without the benefit of surprise, my resolve crumbled. I clamored over crates and sundries to keep out of reach of their prodding blades, I swatted at them with clumsy sweeps of my sword to their great amusement, and I called out to my parents like a mewling calf. My greatest regret is not that I had been a child who had succumbed to fear, but that I had been fool enough to think I was a warrior. I would not be the one to pay for my impetuousness.\n"
"\n"
"My mother and father gave a worthy account of themselves as they fought to reach me. Less than half the slavers who had boarded us still stood by the time my parents succumbed to their wounds and fatigue. My tormentors must have thought this loss had taken the fight out of me, mistaking tears of anger for those of fear. When one of the pair who harried me reached up to grasp my leg, I lashed out with an unexpected ferocity and split her face wide along the bridge of her nose. I bellowed and screamed like an unholy monster, keeping the three remaining slavers at bay with erratic slashes and unpredictable rage.\n"
"\n"
"That is how the Redoran soldiers found us, when their patrol arrived to butcher the monsters who robbed me of my peace and innocence. I was so clouded by rage and exhaustion that I could see no difference between the ash-faced slavers and my dusky saviors. The Redoran captain caught my reckless swing in his gauntlet with ease and pulled me to the deck.\n"
"\n"
"\"Get up, boy,\" he barked without malice or pity. \"Try it again.\""

"\n"
"Congratulations! You are no longer a slave!\n"

"Advisors and counselors will be traveling throughout Morrowind, excluding certain regions* not yet ready to accept the rulings of the Ebonheart Pact, to provide guidance and other assistance to make your transition from slave to free being a simple and painless process.\n"
"\n"
"Welcome to the Pact! We're happy that you're free!\n"

"By Zabia-ko\n"
"\n"
"I, Zabia-ko, now study creatures for the fools in the Mages Guild. Can you imagine? This one, whose last gold was earned selling half-rotten candied nixad to migrant workers on a ship bound for Vivec City? Ha! The fools wanted to pay for stories that would be written anyway, so this one took their gold and questioned no further. \n"
"\n"
"After filling little Zabzag's belly with fresh greens and a night at Balmora's Randy Netch Inn, this one packed up to explore the wetlands of Vvardenfell. For two nights nothing more than the common creeping pests came across my path. What misfortune! In all other stories, they found their way across my path during desperate times. How does one seek out such things? Perhaps I, Zabia-ko, was the fool for taking the guild's gold.\n"
"\n"
"While wallowing in misfortune, it was the smell that drew this one's attention. Large flies, with wide glowing wings buzzed by this one's head. The Dark Elves call them the \"fetcherfly.\" It seems a mere pest, but do not be fooled! When one landed on my arm, it smoked, singeing the fur.\n"
"\n"
"There was no choice. The creature had to be followed so the tale could be told and the gold earned. Tracking the creature back to its nest, there was discovered a large rock the size of two Orcs (or one Orc, if the Orc tells it). Thousands of the flying fires swarmed the rock, which glowed from the heat, its pores venting smoke and life. Suddenly, the whole nest shifted. When it stood, understanding came on how wrong I was. It was the size of at least three Orcs.\n"
"\n"
"I dove flat into the rotten mud as the creature of rock and flies began to amble in my direction. This one is no slayer of great beasts! Why must it pick on me? Swarms of smoking insects fluttered around, hissing as they landed on wet fur. Poor Zabzag shrieked and fled. The end of Zabia-ko would be face down in the mud. \n"
"\n"
"But, obviously, it was not so. The hive golem must have thought this one was no longer a threat, so it plodded off like an echatere with a belly full of snow truffles. This one returned to the inn with many things: a story to tell, clothes full of burn holes, and mud-caked fur.\n"
"\n"
"So if you're ever in the wilds of Vvardenfell, you will wonder as this one did whether the Dark Elves named the fetcherfly because it was annoying or if the word \"fetcher\" came from these pests."

"High Ordinator,\n"
"\n"
"Who can say what drives some of our blessed people to abandon their faith and take up with heretical gods? Greed, I suppose, is a motivating factor, as well as anger, jealousy, and the search for something better. A few, I can accept, are true believers, misguided though they might be. Most, I suspect, are duped fools chasing after whatever promises are laid before them. Take, for example, the Nycotic cult that has recently become active around Balmora. These are supreme fools indeed!\n"
"\n"
"It's obvious that no one in their hierarchy can actually read or understand the Daedric alphabet. Instead, one of their founding members discovered an ancient scroll or forbidden text and bastardized a Daedric word into the Tamrielic tongue. How else can you explain them taking Daedric letters that mean nothing of the sort and deciding that the Prince they have pledged themselves to is someone called \"Nycot.\" Yes, the first five letters of Clavicus Vile's name in Daedric bares a passing resemblance to the letters n, y, c, o, and t in the Tamrielic script, but that's not how it should be rendered or pronounced—the imbeciles!\n"
"\n"
"Further, I don't even think they know that they're worshiping the Prince of Trickery and Bargains. I'm not sure who they think they've pledged themselves to, but that hasn't stopped them from causing problems from Balmora to the Bitter Coast. Some of the cult's leaders have demonstrated real talent in the arcane arts. Who knows? Perhaps Vile has actually heard their foolish prayers and decided to answer them! Regardless, we need to rouse the Order of War and march upon the caves and fissures where they hide and wipe them out—every last one of them!\n"

"By Ulran Releth of House Redoran\n"
"\n"
"The Dunmeri nomads known as the Ashlanders wander Morrowind's wildness, going where they will and doing what they please. Free of the strictures that both provide structure and a high degree of rigidity for the Great Houses, they organize in loose tribes and harken back to an earlier time in Dark Elf history. They subsist as herder-hunters and find simple pleasures in a more natural lifestyle.\n"
"\n"
"Ashlanders revere their ancestors and worship Daedra, refusing to acknowledge the divinity of the Living Gods of the Tribunal. They occasionally trade with other tribes and even with the Great Houses, exchanging guar hides and shalk resin for news of the wider world and goods they can't easily acquire in the wild. Within their nomadic society, the Ashlanders are courteous, proper, and polite. When dealing with outsiders, though, they can become easily offended.\n"
"\n"
"Tribal leaders, called ashkhans, serve as the \"warrior-protector\" of the community they lead. Second in command is the gulakhan, who serves as the voice of the tribe in matters of trade and negotiations. Outsiders will do well to approach the gulakhan first, before attempting to seek an audience with the ashkhan. Each tribe also has a wise-woman, a farseer who keeps the songs, lore, and prophecy of the tribe. She is the spiritual leader of the tribe. The rest of the tribe stands as equals, sharing responsibilities as they hunt, herd, forage, and otherwise support each other.\n"
"\n"
"The nomads are organized into four primary tribes.\n"
"\n"
"The Ahemmusa tribe resides in the southern coastal regions and swamplands of Vvardenfell. In years past, they traveled from coast to coast fishing and hunting, but more recently have largely been pushed out into the Bitter Coast region as Telvanni and Redoran settlements spring up around their former grounds. The Ahemmusa are among the most peaceful of Ashlander tribes and the weakest in terms of amassing any sort of warband. They wear light clothing, often adorned with small shells, scales and even netting. Their weapons are more like tools, simple knives and spears they can use to work as well as defend themselves if need be. They prefer to keep to themselves and be left alone, living out their lives hunting, herding, and especially fishing. They have a small, semi-permanent settlement currently along the Bitter Coast where they live off the fish and other local wildlife in the swamplands.\n"
"\n"
"The Erabenimsun tribe resides in the Molag Amur region of Vvardenfell, and are as dour and dangerous as the volcanic ashlands they hail from. The Erabenimsun are quite war-loving. They are seen as greedy and cruel by their fellow Ashlanders and are believed to not have respect for many Ashlander customs. They care little about prophecy, history, and lore, so the Wise Woman has little power in this tribe. Erabenimsun are also typically the most heavily armed and armored. They are warriors first and foremost, valuing strength above all else.\n"
"\n"
"The Urshilaku tribe is the most highly respected tribe and the second most populous. They reside in the West Gash region and the northern Ashlands, which, like the Grazelands, is considered prime hunting and foraging land. But more than its many hunters, warriors, and herders, Urshilaku is famed for its lore-keepers. It is the only tribe that currently has multiple Farseers, and the Wise-Woman of Urshilaku is widely renowned. Urshilaku has been key in ushering in a temporary age of peace among the Ashlander tribes, for all are listening when the oracles speak of an age of coming strife that the tribes must prepare for. In particular, it is the Urshilaku tribe that keeps faith that Nerevar Incarnate will return soon to unite the people. Urshilaku are some of the only Ashlanders to occasionally use magic. More common than actual spell-weaving is enchanting and alchemy, at which they are highly skilled. They are also the tribe most interested in ancient relics, scrolls, and other items one might find in the ruins dotting Vvardenfell. Bringing them such things is one way to gain favor with this tribe.\n"
"\n"
"The most populous tribe, the proud and confident Zainab resides in the fertile Grazelands region of northeast Vvardenfell. Like the Ahemmusa, they are surprisingly peaceable and friendly even to outlanders, although they are somewhat greedy and arrogant as well. Zainab is, in a way, the oddest of the tribes in that they follow the old ways, but they are extremely interested in the change that has overtaken Vvardenfell. They freely trade with the Great Houses, and some have even sought to forge more firm business deals with Houses like Hlaalu. All in all, one gets the impression that Zainab is the most willing to adapt, even if they will not entirely leave their Ashlander lifestyle behind. Zainab possesses the most diverse collection of goods, including their arms and armor. They typically trade for goods instead of crafting them, and they are well known for harvesting, foraging, and mining in the rich Grazelands, which has led to their unrivaled prosperity."

"Everyone knows the legend. The Heart of Lorkhan, which so famously told Auriel, \"This Heart is the heart of the world, for one was made to satisfy the other.\" Indestructible, hidden away, cast down into the sea. Only to end up beneath the Red Mountain, waiting for the right opportunist to collect it for their own. And today I have come to collect my prize.\n"
"\n"
"Yes, it may only be my speculation that the Heart resides in Nchuleftingth, but my instinct has driven me to success before. I've researched many volumes pertaining to the myth, and all indicate that it lies beneath Red Mountain. This is where I will make my greatest find.\n"
"\n"
"The fact that I believe in this Aedric artifact should speak nothing of my faith to the Divines. Only a fool ignores myth. After all, every story holds some kernal of truth to it. Legends are simply facts that have been expanded upon, morphed into the ridiculous. And I believe that the Heart, though clearly an object of great power, is merely that. A magical object I mean to obtain.\n"
"\n"
"I was surprised to find Neramo here, of all the halfwits I could come across in Vvardenfell. He and his motley crew were easy enough to capture or run off, and I've found the control rod he's left behind quite useful. Naturally I have many modifications for the tool already in mind, but currently it's worked well in getting the Dwarven constructs under my control.\n"
"\n"
"I'm not sure what the Heart of Lorkhan can achieve. Perhaps it will be a powerful potion ingredient, more potent than any Daedra heart. Or perhaps it can grant magical attributes, such as boundless strength or resilience in battle.  Perhaps it is a great soul gem, capable of powering something grander than Tamriel has ever seen. No matter its use, all I know is that it shall earn me enough gold to retire. I am far too sensible to ever attempt to use an item of great power. Too often, such greed leads to despair."

"As we gather for worship here at the Temple, I look out upon you, my fellow faithful, and I see you are troubled, I see you are anxious, I see you shift in your seats and glance over your shoulders even as I speak to you. And I know why you are troubled and anxious, for who could not be troubled when Red Mountain grumbles and seethes? Who could not be anxious when Baar Dau trembles in the sky, when unknown Daedra appear in unexpected locales, when it is even said that the Nerevarine has risen among the Ashlanders? \n"
"\n"
"But I say to you, fellow Dunmer, have not all these things and worse happened before? Did our people not survive them and become stronger every time? What says our Lord Vivec about such struggles? \"Six are the guardians of Veloth,\" says Vivec, \"three before and they are born again, and they will test you until you have the proper tendencies of a hero.\"\n"
"\n"
"And so, once more, we are tested. And so, once more, we shall endure and prove worthy. For the Three are with us, and we are strong through our faith in the Three. Our Living Gods call upon us all to honor them with our efforts.\n"
"\n"
"We call upon House Redoran to buttress our structures, physical and moral, building the new and rebuilding the old, and to keep us on the path of righteousness.\n"
"\n"
"We call upon House Hlaalu to plant, harvest, and preserve, to keep the river of trade flowing, to ensure prosperity even through fall of ash and breath of fume.\n"
"\n"
"We call upon House Telvanni to be wise and forbearing, sharing insights and enchantments, for though they are not of the Pact, they are still of our people.\n"
"\n"
"And we call on you, followers of the Tribunal, to remember the example of Saint Nerevar, whose courage is a watchword and whose endurance is a legend. For though we are anxious and troubled, we are proud and we are fierce, for we are the Dunmer, and for us, trouble is a gift from the gods. For by trouble are we tested, and by passing the test we know our true worth. \n"

"Skar's hollow eyes gaze upon the camps, webs clotting his vision as firelight dances across his withered face. His open maw now stands as an entryway, open only to the worthiest among the Ashlanders. They walk before this towering beast, the fallen foe of their ancestors. There is no music or drink, but rather solemn contemplation and prayer. I only hear their murmured voices and the crackle of the flames.\n"
"\n"
"The Ashlanders say little to an outlander such as myself. They hold no love for any outside of their tribe, and a burning hatred for Dark Elves who follow the Tribunal. I feel turmoil growing, sunken into the ashen soil, fixed deeper than the legs of the fallen Skar. I feel there would be little hesitation among the Vvardenfell Dark Elves, should an opportunity arise for war.\n"
"\n"
"I try to understand their ways, their customs. Their history with the horrid beast, the house of their council, a shrine of their past. How was Skar defeated? Why is his corpse used as their meeting grounds? My questions are met with silence by most. Those willing to speak do so for the promise of food or gold, and even they have little to say. \n"
"\n"
"What I do know is that their ancestors defeated Skar in battle, though I'm not sure how. Some speak of a spear, but not of who wielded it. Who was this mysterious warrior? I would expect him to be well revered, honored among the Ashlanders. Why do none know his name? The oral traditions passed, those shared among the campfires I'm allowed to attend, they hold extraordinary details. Why does this name escape their memory?\n"
"\n"
"The morbid grounds where the Ashlanders meet hold great importance as well. It reminds me of thanes that mount their kills above their thrones, a show of power and triumph. As the Ashlanders think upon their past victories, they also gain hope for future glory. They were the mer who felled this beast, the mighty Skar. What can they not accomplish, should the day come?\n"
"\n"
"I look upon Skar's carcass, a shudder running through me. It fills me with dread, yet for these Ashlanders I believe he is a sign of hope, of strength. My gaze runs along their campfires and I wonder. What will come of that strength, of that pride? What future is in store for these tribes? Perhaps another Skar will rise and they will be the ones to defeat him. Or perhaps they will be the ones who are defeated. Only the passage of time will reveal that truth."

"스카(Skar)의 파여진 눈이 캠프를 바라보고, 장작불이 메말라버린 그의 얼굴을 아른거리는 가운데 거미줄은 스카의 눈에 엉겨 붙어있다. 스카의 벌어진 입은 이제 입구로 쓰이고, 애쉬 랜더들 중 가장 적합한 이에게만 열린다. 그들은 조상들이 무찌른 이 거대한 짐승의 앞을 걷는다. 여기에는 음악도 술도 없고, 오히려 엄숙한 명상과 기도가 있다. 내게 들리는 것은 오직 그들의 속삭이는 듯한 목소리와 불꽃의 타들어가는 소리뿐이다.\n"
"\n"
"애쉬랜더들은 나같은 외지인에게 거의 말을 걸지 않는다. 그들은 그들 부족 이외의 어느 지역에도 애정이 없고, 트리뷰날을 따르는 다크엘프들에 대한 타오르는 증오를 품고 있다. 나는 이 소요가 커지는 것을 느낀다. 그것은 애쉬부족의 땅속에 가라앉아, 죽은 스카의 다리보다 더 깊게 뿌리박혔다. 전쟁을 일으킬 기회가 있다면, 바덴펠의 다크엘프들은 주저하지 않을거라고 나는 생각한다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 그들의 방식과 관습을 이해하려고 노력한다. 그들의 역사는 무시무시한 괴물, 그들의 의회 건물, 그들 과거의 성소와 함께 한다. 어떻게 스카를 물리쳤을까? 왜 그것의 시체가 그들의 회의장소로 사용되었을까? 나의 의문들은 대다수의 침묵에 직면한다. 그것에 대해 말해주는 사람들은 음식이나 돈을 위해 말하지만, 그들조차도 아는 것이 많지 않다.\n"
"\n"
"내가 아는 것은 그들의 조상이 전투에서 스카를 물리쳤다는 것이다. 하지만 어떻게 물리쳤는지는 확실하지 않다. 어떤 이들은 창에 대해서 말하지만, 누가 그것을 사용 했는지는 말하지 못한다. 이 미스테리한 전사는 누구일까? 나는 그가 애쉬 랜더들에게 존경받고 숭배받길 기대한다. 왜 아무도 그의 이름을 알지 못할까? 나의 참석이 허락된 야영장에서 공유되는 구전전통들은 특별히 더 세세한 내용들까지 들어있다. 그런데도 왜 그의 이름은 그들의 기억에서 사라졌는가?\n"
"\n"
"애쉬 랜더들이 마주하는 섬뜩한 장소 또한 매우 큰 의의를 지니고 있다. 힘과 승리를 보여주기 위해 그들이 잡은 짐승을 자신들의 왕좌 위에올려놓은 모습은 나에게 테인들(Thanes)을 떠올리게 하였다. 애쉬 랜더들이 과거의 승리를 떠올릴때, 그들은 미래의 영광을 위한 희망도 얻는다. 그들은 이 짐승, 강력한 스카를 쓰러뜨린 머(Mer)였다. 그 날이 오게된다면, 그들이 무엇인들 성취 못하겠는가?\n"
"\n"
"나는 스카의 시체를 지켜본다. 온몸에 전율이 흐른다. 그것은 나를 두려움에 떨게하지만, 애시 랜더들에게는 희망과 힘의 상징이라고 나는 믿는다. 시선이 모닥불을 따라가다가 문득 나는 궁금해졌다. 저 힘과, 긍지로부터 무엇이 생겨나게 될까? 이 부족에게 어떤 미래가 기다리고 있을까? 어쩌면 또다른 스카가 나타나 그들은 다시 그것을 무찌른 사람들이 될지도 모른다. 아니면 스카에게 패배한 사람들이 될지도. 오직 시간이 흘러야만 진실을 알게 될 것이다."

"The Vvardenfell landscape undergoes a constant cycle of death and rebirth. Red Mountain's lava flows, eruptions and ash-fall cause die-back in the deciduous woodlands and mushroom jungles, violent upheaval alters the landscape and buries (or exposes!) the fallen ruins of ancient civilizations. But the island expands as lava hardens, and new plants and fungi emerge from the cooling ashes among the formations of igneous rock. \n"
"\n"
"Plant life flourishes in the rich soil fertilized by volcanic activity, and so Vvardenfell serves as home to a diverse set of habitats and environments. \n"
"\n"
"Fungi quickly absorb rich nutrients from the volcanic soil and grow to enormous proportions and dominate the landscape. The large ink-cap mushrooms along the Bitter Coast thrive on the detritus of decaying swamp life, while smaller fungus varieties cover the rocks, trees and even some animals, such as the fungus-encrusted shroom beetle. Adorable!\n"
"\n"
"Balmora, in the southwest and inland from the Bitter Coast, is still forested, though ash from Red Mountain eruptions threatens to denude the slopes.\n"
"\n"
"Though barren, the Ashlands host a remarkable number of species. Ash hoppers skitter through the dry ash dunes and giant xylaria fungi extend their tendrils into the sky. Travelers beware! Hungry, reptilian cliff-striders lurk atop the crags.\n"
"\n"
"Fetcherflies build their hives where they can tap volcanic heat to gestate their eggs. When they hatch, the queen taps a source of magma to animate the nest and it transforms into a walking hive golem that relocates the swarm to new surroundings.\n"
"\n"
"Nix-oxen roam the Grazelands in the northeastern part of the island, and though generally considered to be mild-mannered, they will not hesitate to defend their territory.\n"
"\n"
"Two-legged vvardvarks romp through the grasses and feed on small bugs. Some people keep these delightful creatures as pets, despite their terrible smell.\n"
"\n"
"Ancestral tombs dot the landscape, and powerful Daedra known as Hunger have recently been seen within. \n"
"\n"
"The largest mushrooms in Morrowind appear in Zafirbel Bay. This majestic species is cultivated by Telvanni wizards and take a wizard's lifetime (a thousand years) to grow. These fungus forests have a special ecology of their own—but that's a subject for another book."

"\"I've flown these shores since I was born,\" the netch replied. \"I do not know how.\"\n"

"\"Don't know, don't know, oh what a show!\" the crow called out. \"Where are your glossy feathers that help you glide?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I have no need of feathers to glide,\" the netch explained, \"but I have a strong, thick hide to protect me.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"A hide! A hide! Oh, what a find,\" the crow mocked. \"Tell me netch, where are your eyes?\"\n"

"\"I need no eyes to sail the skies, as you can plainly see,\" the netch once more replied.\n"

"\"No eyes, no eyes, to sail the skies!\" the prideful crow continued. \"But it makes you far uglier than I!\" And he began to laugh at the netch's misfortune.\n"

"The crow's laughter grew louder and louder, eventually attracting a nearby cliff-racer. The beast swooped down upon the crow, swallowing him whole, and he could mock the netch no more.\n"

"His daughter was delighted at this gift, but her husband only glared.\n"

"The husband inspected every inch of the guar, even forcing the beast to open its mighty jaws to look at the state of its teeth. \n"
"\n"
"\"Well, it will have to do,\" the husband conceded, though he knew it was a fine guar indeed.\n"

"One summer's day, a councilor was walking along the market in her splendid regalia, attended by her many servants. She was so splendid that a small mer in the crowd told his mother, \"I wish my mother was a councilor, instead of you!\"\n"
"\n"
"The little mer never expected the councilor to hear him, nor did he expect her to turn toward him in the crowd.\n"
"\n"
"\"I have heard your wish, little one, and I accept,\" she told the open-mouthed little mer. \"You will be my child, and you will have all that you wish.\"\n"
"\n"
"The little mer was immediately taken to the councilor's manor and placed in a room with toys and sweets. He laughed and clapped his hands, playing and eating all he wished. But soon he grew bored and went to speak to a servant.\n"
"\n"
"\"It's no fun playing by myself,\" he told the servant. \"Can I have someone to play with?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"The child of the councilor has no equal,\" the servant told him. \"There is none worthy to play with you.\"\n"
"\n"
"The little mer had little time to think on this when a scholar came to his room. The scholar looked upon the little mer with scorn and said, \"Your lessons should have begun hours ago! The child of the councilor must know many great things.\"\n"
"\n"
"The little mer was made to listen to the scholar's lectures for hours and hours, and soon his head ached with all that he was to know.\n"
"\n"
"Eventually it was time for dinner, but the little mer's troubles were not over.\n"
"\n"
"\"In those clothes? In that state?\" cried his servant, horrified. \"You must be washed and clothed if you are to be presented as the child of the councilor!\" And so the little mer was scrubbed roughly and forced into very uncomfortable clothes.\n"
"\n"
"By this point the little mer was almost in tears. He missed his home, and his clothes, and his friends. But most of all he missed his mother, who he had never gone a day without.\n"
"\n"
"When the little mer was finally sent to the dining hall, he was met with a surprise. Seated at the dining table was his family, all laughing and smiling. He ran to his mother's arms and cried, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I want you to be my mother after all!\"\n"
"\n"
"The councilor, who was seated at the head of the table, smiled and told the little mer, \"You have learned a very important lesson, my child. We often forget to be thankful for what we have, when thinking only of what we want.\""

"The Telvanni, the most mysterious of the Great House in all respects, features one of the most looming curiosities—both literally and figuratively—the mushroom structures which they live and work within. The House has never given an official statement about their choice of architecture, and most are too frightened by Telvanni's vast power to ask. It's common knowledge that the Telvanni magisters value their privacy, but why not build a tower of stone or wood? I decided to ask the common folk their theories. Names have been changed to protect the speakers from Telvanni attention.\n"
"\n"
"I first talked to local merchants who weren't officially affiliated with the House, but often sell wares to its members. A rather exasperated Dark Elf named Verna was happy to explain her theory:\n"
"\n"
"\"It's the smell, that's what it is! They're obsessed with this Three-forsaken stench. Can't get enough of it. I think there's something about their biology, something different from other Dark Elves. Makes them just crave the smell of mushrooms, so much so that they magicked them into towers. I've heard they sit up there all day and just inhale the fumes. Me? I just get headaches. What's wrong with the fresh scent of pine, or stone, or any other honest building material? Sometimes I think I'd rather see the towers made of silt strider dung than of moldy old mushrooms!\"\n"
"\n"
"An Argonian inn-keeper, Makes-Some-Waves, believed that the purpose was more functional:\n"
"\n"
"\"Well, we all know that the Telvanni are isolationists. They can't even be bothered to attend the inter-council meetings. My guess is that they eat the mushrooms, to save on trips to the market. Only makes sense, doesn't it? Mushroom stew, mushroom pie, mushroom gravy! There's a lot you can make with bits of mushroom. We just don't notice because their slaves gather the stuff discreetly. Wouldn't want to ruin their image by being mushroom fanatics, would they? Well, more fanatical I suppose than simply having your entire house built out of the stuff.\"\n"
"\n"
"A rather friendly Dark Elf merchant by the name of Hader had a vastly different opinion of what the mushrooms were used for:\n"

"\"I've heard that mushrooms are a powerful aphrodisiac. Really makes you wonder what those magisters do all day up in those towers. I've thought about taking up my own collection, for purely studious purposes, of course. But I'd rather not attract the attention of the homeowners. Telvanni mages aren't very giving Dark Elves, even when well pleased. And I suspect they might be pleased more often than they let on, if you catch my drift. By the way, you did say that you were changing my name for this, didn't you?\"\n"
"\n"
"The merchants who cater to Telvanni were interesting sources of material and raised many questions for me to consider, but I found myself drawn to those who worked directly for the House. Though most slaves were unwilling to speak to me, I found an Orc hireling who had this to say:\n"
"\n"
"\"Well, who else is using [the mushrooms]? If they're there, they're there. Might as well make some use of them. Only useful decision the Telvanni ever made, truth be told.\"\n"
"\n"
"Maybe the truth was that simple. The Telvanni found this native flora and simply wished to make use of it. A matter of convenience seems to be the most plausible theory I had heard, but was it the truth? I had but one more source I could find who would speak their mind, a Khajiit trader by the name of Rumoc, who explained:\n"
"\n"
"\"This one always thought the towers were built to intimidate outlanders. Rumoc was most unsettled when he set up business in [retracted]. Having such a strange tower looming above you. Perhaps it represents the Telvanni themselves, yes? Imposing, mysterious, almost haunting. The Telvanni do not wish to welcome ones such as us to their lands. It is in their best interest to keep us frightened.\"\n"
"\n"
"I could get no official comment from a member of House Telvanni, other than a few strongly worded requests that I cease my inquiries. But my curiosity cannot be contained by mere threats, and the mystery of the Telvanni is something I will always find myself attempting to unravel. I take heart in the fact that even under the House's oppressive eye, so many shared with me their thoughts and theories, each more interesting and thought-provoking than the last."

"By Falura Uveleth, Former Officer\n"
"\n"
"It got the job done.\n"
"\n"
"That's what I told myself after a tough call, after a hard assignment. It may not have been by the book, but hey, nothing ever is. Little things at first, things I thought I'd forget by the end of the week. A well-placed bribe here, a promise that my superiors would know nothing about. I kept slipping, and slipping, until I was telling myself that phrase every night. It got the job done.\n"
"\n"
"And who could really question my goals? The House Redoran's Narcotics Oath-Bureau is one of the best forces for good Vvardenfell has to offer. What could be more noble? We were cleaning up Vvardenfell, one arrest at a time. Anyone who went undercover knew the stakes, and they knew that our superiors were more apt to look the other way if the results were to their liking. Maybe that was my first mistake. Thinking no one was looking.\n"
"\n"
"The skooma ring I infiltrated was top priority. Skooma is nasty stuff, an opiate that causes hallucinations. Addictive, deadly, cheap, the drug's a powerful combination. Even the growth and sale of moon sugar is illegal on Vvardenfell's shores, for good reason. With such a high stakes case they decided to send their best officer, who at the time happened to be me.\n"
"\n"
"When an officer infiltrates a skooma ring there are the expectations, and then there's the reality. They can't avoid certain habits. Bribes are commonplace, extortion as well. No one talks about torture when you're signing up, but it happens. Deaths come with a bit of paperwork, but hey, who's going to mourn a dealer? All of these you can learn to live with. It's what you eventually can't live without that eats you up.\n"
"\n"
"It shouldn't be surprising that few skooma rings accept members who don't use the product, at least occasionally. There's no bigger red flag than turning down an offered pipe, and in my line of work even the smallest of suspicions can lead to a quiet death in some dark alley.\n"
"\n"
"The case itself went off without a hitch. I did my usual reconnaissance, gained trust of those up top. Found out who was in charge and where trade was coming in. The case closed within three months, quicker than any other officer could have finished it. But not quick enough.\n"
"\n"
"I admit, I was hooked. It was an itch I couldn't scratch, a thought I couldn't drown out. I started drinking, thinking that would numb the withdrawal. But drink simply washed away my resolve, and eventually I was searching for dealers for a whole different reason.\n"
"\n"
"It was fine for a time. I was able to keep my dosages short, concealed my habit from those around me. It all fell apart when another officer brought in my dealer, and she was more than happy to talk. Not surprising, but I suppose addiction doesn't bring the clearest of mindsets.\n"
"\n"
"I was told I was lucky to be stripped of my rank and not thrown behind bars, but I'm not one to lie down and accept my disgrace. I'm nothing if not resourceful. I've sobered up and smartened up, and now I'm on a new mission. I'll win back my honor if it's the last thing I do, no matter the means."

"By Vorar Vendu, One-Time Camonna Tong\n"
"\n"
"You probably heard of the Camonna Tong. It's the name whispered in dark alleys as blood pools on the cobblestones, the signature on the ransom note left on a neighbor's bed. A shadow, a curse, a boil upon the arse of our society. And, though I'm not proud to admit it, it's a part of my past.\n"
"\n"
"Now, I'm not writing this for those of you already on the right side of the law. I'm writing this for the ones who have already ventured off that moral path, those that walk the thin line between wrong and right. The ones with empty bellies and emptier coffers, who might see the Camonna Tong as a viable option. To you I say, keep reading.\n"
"\n"
"Sure, the Camonna Tong has stability. A steady stream of income is a hard thing to turn down, and they've got structure to boot. They'll lure you in with the possibility of glory, of command, of rising through the ranks. And sure, what they do is far from legal. But if you're already leaning in that direction, wouldn't you rather be in good company?\n"
"\n"
"It didn't take much sweet talking before I signed right up, and at first life was good. Extorting the rich flat-heads who had lorded above me all my life? My pleasure! A few robberies, a few break-ins? Nothing I wasn't use to. And sure, we talked big about driving away the outlanders, of taking Vvardenfell back for the Dark Elves. But I'll be honest, nothing made me question what I was doing.\n"
"\n"
"Nothing, that is, until some Argonian seamstress got a little uppity. \n"
"\n"
"Oh, it was the talk of the town. Some scaled n'wah had the gall to start up her own shop—and be successful with it to boot! She was taking away good business from Dark Elves, that's what she was doing. Taking away gold from our mothers and sisters. So we did what the Camonna Tong does best. We made her pay. \n"
"\n"
"The kidnapping was easy. Yeah, her shop was doing well, but she was still an Argonian. I don't think we saw a single guard as we slipped into her house, not in that part of town. We tied her up and gagged her before she had a chance to cry for help, laughing like it was some big joke. Young hotheads who had too much to drink. I thought we were just going to scare her, set her straight, make her realize that she couldn't think herself better.\n"
"\n"
"I started to sober up when the beatings began. First a slap to her face, but that quickly turned to punches and kicks. They joked about how she could take it, how Argonian skin was so thick no one would even see the bruises. I can still hear her muffled cries along with their laughter. \n"
"\n"
"I just watched as the beatings became more intense, as blood started dribbling from her gagged mouth. I wasn't a stranger to violence, or truly opposed to it given my line of work. But there was something about tying up this old Argonian and beating her bloody, kicking her as she fell to the floor. My throat grew tight as I watched, motionless. No one seemed to notice my lack of enthusiasm, so enraptured in the righteous justice they gladly doled out. \n"
"\n"
"Someone pulled out a dagger and made the casual remark, \" You know, it's pretty hard to sew without fingers.\" \n"
"\n"
"Suddenly I was wide awake.\n"
"\n"
"I wish I could tell you that I stopped them. Said something clever, did something brave. But the truth is I walked out. I left that room, that town, that life. Not with my head held high, but broken, defeated, thinking of that poor Argonian's eyes, filled with terror. So different from my own, yet so alike. I don't know if they went through with it, if there's a fingerless beggar somewhere who sees my face in her nightmares. I don't think I'll ever try to find out.\n"
"\n"
"So next time you think of the Camonna Tong, of the glamor and the gold? You think of how easy it is for your crooked morals to slip away entirely. How big talk and some drink can lead you down a darker path than you ever realized you were capable of. How easy it is to say nothing, and how much easier to just join along."

"당신은 아마 카모나 통에 대해 들어봤을 것이다. 피 웅덩이가 있는 검은 골목길의 속삭임에서나 이웃집 침대에 남겨진 몸값 쪽지에 적혀있을 이름이다. 그림자, 저주, 우리 사회의 골칫거리., 비록 그것을 인정하는 것이 자랑스럽지는 않지만, 그것은 내 과거의 일부분이다.\n"

"아무 것도, 그러니까,어떤 아르고니안 재봉사가 약간 건방을 떨기 전까지는.\n"

"오, 그것은 그 마을의 화제였다. 어떤 비늘이 있는 n'wah가 용감하게도 그녀 자신의 가게를 열었고,그건 성공적이었다. 다크 엘프들로부터 좋은 사업을 빼앗았다. 우리의  어머니, 누이들이 벌 돈을 뺏는 것이 그녀의 사업이었다. 그래서 우리는 카모나 통이 제일 잘하는 일을 했다. 우리는 그녀가 돈을 내도록 만들었다. \n"
"\n"
"유괴는 쉬웠다. 그래, 그녀의 가게는 안전한 것 같지만, 그녀가 아르고니안이라는건 변함 없다.몰래 그 여자 집에 들어갔을때 그 집이 마을의 일부가 아닌것마냥 경비원은 한 명도 못 본 것 같다. 우리는 그녀를 묶은  후 그녀가 청하기 전에 재갈을 물렸고, 그것이 웃기는 농담을 들은 것처럼 웃었다. 술을 너무 많이 마신 젊은 성미가 급한 놈들. 나는 우리가 그녀를 겁주고, 똑바로 세우고, 그녀 스스로가 별게 아니란걸 일깨워 줄 것이라고 생각했다.\n"
"\n"
"구타가 시작되자 술이 깨기 시작했다. 처음에는 뺨을 때렸지만, 그것은 곧 주먹과 발차기로 바뀌었다. 그들은 그녀가 그것을 어떻게 참는지, 아르고니안의 피부가 얼마나 두꺼운지에 대해 농담을 했다. 심지어 아무도 멍을 볼 수 없었다. 나는 아직 그들의 웃음과 함께 그녀의 틀어막힌 울음소리가 생생하게 기억난다. \n"
"\n"
"나는 그녀의 달싹거리는 입에서 피가 흐르기 시작하자, 구타가 더욱 격렬해지는 것을 목격했다. 나는 폭력이 익숙한 사람이었고, 내 직업상 반대할 사람도 아니다 . 하지만  늙은 아르고니안을 묶고 피가 흐를 때까지 패고, 바닥에 쓰러질 때까지 발로 차는 중 뭔가가 생겼다. 지켜보는게 괴로워 숨이 막히기 시작했다. 아무도 내가 성의가 없어졌다는 걸 눈치 채지 못한 것 같았고,그래서 그들은 기꺼이 그들의 정의를 행하는데에 열중했다. \n"
"\n"
"누군가가 단도를 꺼내면서 무심코 말했다. \"알다시피 손가락 없이는 바느질을 하기가 꽤 어려워.\" \n"
"\n"
"갑자기 나는 정신이 번쩍 들었다.\n"
"\n"
"내가 그들을 막았다고 말할 수 있으면 좋겠다. 무언가 멋진 말을 하면서, 용감한 행동을 했다고. 하지만 진실은, 나는 그들을 놔두고 그냥 밖으로 나갔다는 거다. 나는 그 방, 그 마을, 그 삶을 떠났다.내 머리가 높이 효수될 일은 없었지만 나는 망가지고 패배했다. 그 불쌍한 아르고니안의 공포로 가득 찬 눈을 생각하면. 나와는 다르게 생긴 눈이지만 너무 똑같다는 생각이 든다. 나는 그들이 그녀를 평생을 악몽 속에서 내 얼굴을 기억할 손가락 없는 거지로 만들었는지 아닌지 모른다. 절대 알고 싶지 않다.\n"
"\n"
"다음에도 카모나 통이라는 매력과 돈에 대한 유혹이 생긴다면? 당신은 당신의 뒤틀린 도덕심이 얼마나 쉽게 끝장까지 가는 지를 떠올려야 한다. 허풍과 약간의 술이 어떻게 당신을 당신의 한계보다 더 어두운 길로 이끌 수 있는지. 아무 말도 하지 않는 것이 얼마나 쉬운 일이고, 그저 동조만 하는 건 또 얼마나 더 쉬운 일인지를."

"Most esteemed Minister Tharyon, House Redoran,\n"
"\n"
"I write to you on a matter of grave importance. My office has received an ever-increasing number of complaints in recent weeks. Many of our House Guests have experienced poor treatment at the hands of House Redoran bailiffs and constables. As you well know, House Hlaalu is duty-bound to address these grievances on their behalf.\n"
"\n"
"My dear minster, while I share your belief in the superiority of the Dunmer people, we must try to keep such opinions to ourselves. House Hlaalu defers to House Redoran on matters of defense; I would urge you to defer to us on matters of commerce and diplomacy.\n"
"\n"
"Our economy is in peril. The Pact has brought us some measure of security, yes, but the cost has been dear. Dearer than I think your Redoran kinsmen are willing to admit. My trade ministers have gone to great lengths to solidify our holdings outside Morrowind. While the enemy has seized most of our extraterritorial property, we retain sizable assets in Imperial bourses and foreign business concerns. Extracting this wealth is no small task. It takes time, gold, and most importantly, connections. We can ill-afford to alienate what few friends we have outside the Pact.\n"
"\n"
"Just this morning I received a complaint from one Theodric Ashcroft—a respected Breton investor. Apparently he was accosted by a pair of constables. while inspecting a potential construction site. Some minor religious infraction, I'm told—stepping over a fence to get a better look at the property, or something? According to Ashcroft, the constable forced him to the ground, dragged him to the Temple, and turned him over to the Ordinators, who subjected him to no less than three hours of interrogation and corporal reeducation. Needless to say, he will not be investing in our fair city. Both Ashcroft and his gold fled to the mainland.\n"
"\n"
"These people may be inferior, their religions may be repugnant, their manners may be tiresome. But for the love of the Three, swallow your pride and bear it! Idle zealotry cannot put food on the table. We cannot fill our coffers with incense and prayer and expect to wage war effectively. Interprovincial commerce is a necessary evil, whether you like it or not. I urge you in the strongest possible terms—leave outsiders be. I hope this will be my final word on the subject.\n"

"Yours most respectfully,\n"

"From the Memoirs of Canon Nileno Nirith\n"
"\n"
"As a child, I took great pains to avoid the Waiting Door. We weren't wealthy by any means, so our family shrine was really no more than a small shelf. I remember that my mother would polish it every Morndas eve, singing all the while. But despite all the songs and joyful communions, there was something about that space that set my skin to crawl—like going into a dark basement by candlelight or waking suddenly from a bad dream.\n"
"\n"
"My parents stored a great many relics on the threshold of our Waiting Door, but the one I remember best was a polished lure. My grandfather was a fisherman, you see. Not by trade, but by avocation. He would wake well before dawn and paddle out to the center of Lake Hairan, keen to hook a wrasse or two before beginning his daily labors.\n"
"\n"
"One brisk morning in early Frostfall, I awoke from a dead sleep to the smell of pipe smoke. Afraid that my father had left his hookah smoldering, I crept out into the parlor to find the flame and smother it. To my great surprise his pipe rested on the end-table, cool as a river stone. Still, the scent persisted. I followed it around the corner and down the hall until, at length, I came to the Waiting Door. That same fear I always felt welled up in my throat. But then, seeing my grandfather's lure, I felt a profound sense of ease. I strained on my tip-toes to reach the shelf and took the lure in hand. This was, of course, thoroughly taboo, but in my child's heart I knew it was the right thing to do.\n"
"\n"
"Without changing out of my night-clothes, I stole out the back door and jumped into my uncle's boat. I paddled out to my grandfather's favorite spot, affixed the lure to a line, and cast it out into the lake. I remember the water was like polished glass, and the moons' reflection glided across it so peacefully that even a single ripple felt like a blasphemy.\n"
"\n"
"After an hour of silence I got a bite—a massive one. My lean arms strained against the fish for what felt like an eternity. Eventually, I landed it. It was a great fire-wrasse like my grandfather used to catch. My chest swelled with pride as I paddled home. By this point the sun had started to rise and the bantam guars were stirring in their coops. I placed the fish on a flaying board and started toward my parents' room to tell them the tale. But at the last moment, I hesitated. I glanced over my shoulder to see the Waiting Door and the empty spot where my grandfather's lure was enshrined. I took the relic from my pocket, kissed it, and placed it back on the shelf.\n"
"\n"
"In that moment I saw the face of my grandfather—the face of my ancestors. And from that point onward, I was never afraid."

"By Kylia Thando, Expert Kwama Wrangler\n"
"\n"
"Welcome to the wonderful world of kwama! These adorable creatures come in a variety of sizes, roles, and dispositions, each more beautiful than the last. Our goal, of course, is the welfare of each and every kwama in Vvardenfell, but many see these majestic creatures only as sources of profit. Remember though, a happy mine is a productive mine! It's in the best interest of all that we treat kwama with respect and dignity.\n"
"\n"
"Kwama are best known for their relation to egg-mining, and of course there can be no eggs without a queen. Kwama queens are beautiful beings, far larger than any other kwama. Good thing for us, for she's the one who produces all of the yummy eggs which end up on our dinner plates! A queen in distress is not only a sad sight to see, it also can cause egg productivity to plummet. Make sure your queen is well fed, and at the end of the day you'll end up with a full belly, too!\n"
"\n"
"You're not the only one taking care of the queen, of course. She has kwama foragers, warriors, and workers at her disposal. Each of these kwama have important roles to play in the colony, and each makes sure their queen is well fed or well protected. If you want a happy queen, you need a happy colony. The reverse is also quite true! A distressed queen always leads to an upset colony, and that hurts productivity.\n"
"\n"
"Kwama foragers serve as the scouts of the colony, always looking for new homes and suitable prey. If met in the wild, it's best to resist the urge to pet these lovely creatures, as they can be quite aggressive. I'm sure you would be a bit peeved as well if some stranger came up to pat you on the head! Keep your distance and these little fellows shouldn't harm you.\n"
"\n"
"A kwama built to inflict harm, however, is the mighty warrior. Though not as large as their lovely queen, these soldiers are often taller than your common Dark Elf. Don't be too awestruck if you meet one! A hasty exit is usually your best chance to escape the mine unscathed. Workers often emit special scents to protect them from a kwama warrior's wrath. Make sure that you speak to a knowledgeable alchemist if you wish to obtain the proper scents.\n"
"\n"
"And last, but most certainly not least, is the ever busy kwama worker! My word, but there would be no colony at all without these bustling bugs! The kwama worker digs the tunnels, tends to the queen, and watches over the precious eggs until they're ready to harvest. They're often nonaggressive, but best not to disturb these little ones while they're about their work. You never know if a kwama warrior lurks around the corner.\n"
"\n"
"These basics provide the start in understanding our hard-shelled little friends! Further chapters in this volume will explore breeding methods, nutrition guides, mining practices, and much more! Join me in the journey, and together we can protect kwama of all kinds."

"By Raleth Heladren\n"
"\n"
"Today I met an Orc who was far more conversational than most. One good thing I can say about Orcs (and trust me there are few) is that they keep to themselves. They know their place, and they're about as trusting to those outside their kith as the Dark Elves. Good. That's how you survive.\n"
"\n"
"Though I am always aware of my superiority to other races, I am not above a conversation. Any fellow traveler may one day be met again on the road, and it's often pertinent for them to hold a good view of you. Many of my fellow Dark Elves would do far better if they knew when to smile, especially my compatriots who refuse to cling to the cities like babes to a teat. \n"
"\n"
"This particular Orc introduced himself to me as Morbrogug as he sat beside me. The cornerclub that night was uncommonly crowded, and I was unable to maintain my usual lone table. Still, I smiled. I fought the urge to take my meal elsewhere, and held my breath against his odor. I even asked his destination.\n"
"\n"
"He easily admitted that he wasn't sure, that he was just seeking a steady wage. His skills were limited to his strength, as is common among Orcs. I suggested mining or quarry work, tasks I've found wherein his breed often excels. He was hesitant to accept my suggestion, instead describing his supposed prowess as a warrior. I simply nodded and conceded the point, though I knew he was more than likely to end up doing physical labor than find work as a mercenary while in Vvardenfell.\n"
"\n"
"It was at this point that Morbrogug pointed out my armor. I noticed he had been eying it intently as we spoke, his eyes almost glittering at its sight. Yes, I do pride myself on taking proper care of my armor, but I suspected he had never seen its like before. Surely enough, he soon asked me what it was made of, and I held back my sigh and told him.\n"
"\n"
"\"Glass?\" he asked with a scrunch of his nose and a scratch to his head. \"What, like what they use in windows?\"\n"
"\n"
"Another day, another ignorant member of the common rabble. \"No, it's not quite that,\" I replied with a forced grin. \"You see, it's made from malachite, which has the appearance of crystal. It's quite hard, but light enough for easy maneuverability. Though a metal, it's commonly referred to as glass, as are the mines where it's harvested. Always causes a bit of confusion with outlanders.\"\n"
"\n"
"Morbrogug rolled his eyes and banged his leather breastplate. \"We Orcs know the true worth of leather and metal! Give me that over your fancy glass any day. I bet I could shatter your armor with one swing of my ax. You've obviously never been up against a true warrior.\"\n"
"\n"
"Now, I do appreciate a sense of pride, but when pride turns to insults ….\n"
"\n"
"I simply raised a brow. \"A bet, is it? Well then, I'll take you up on that wager. I'll give you my armor, which should at the very least turn you a pretty profit, if you defeat me in a duel. And if I win I'll have your leather armor. After all, fair's fair.\"\n"
"\n"
"He stroked his wine stained chin and nodded. \"Deal. I could use some gold for a new weapon.\"\n"
"\n"
"The only details of the fight that I care to recall was that it was quick and effortless, at least on my part. At the end of it all I had a sobbing Orc, begging me to take back my sacred word, claiming he could never find mercenary work without his own set of armor.\n"
"\n"
"I could only shrug as I gathered the leather pieces in my arms. \"There's always the quarry.\"\n"
"\n"
"Yes, it is good to make friends while traveling. But it is far better to make a profit."

"Hearken, young ones, and I'll tell you a tale! A long, long time ago, Sheogorath grew bored, which is a very dangerous thing to happen to a Daedric Prince of Madness. As is true of all the House of Troubles, he held no love in his heart, and so he did something very cruel. He took a mighty rock from the void that surrounds us, and flung it far, far, far toward Nirn. Now Sheogorath didn't much care where this large rock would hit or what chaos it would cause. He simply wanted to see what it would do.\n"
"\n"
"Who was to stop this evil plan? Was it the Divines, in all their good and wisdom? No, for they can do no more than offer false hope and hollow faith. Perhaps the Daedric Princes, with their power and enchantments? But no, neither mer nor man could offer enough to get these pitiful Princes to face such a daunting challenge. And so it flew and flew and flew, and straight down it came to the most beautiful island in all of Nirn. It fell toward Vvardenfell.\n"

"Many wept and wailed as it approached. The Ashlanders prayed to Azura, who did nothing. Men and mer prayed to the Divines, who did nothing. But the Dark Elves, we prayed to the Three, to our ever glorious Living Gods. And Vivec heard our prayers.\n"
"\n"
"He raised his hand, calm and serene, glowing in his holy light. And the fall of the celestial rock became slower and slower and slower still. And all who wept and wailed stopped, for Baar Dau had finally come to its resting place. Safely there it hung in the air, above the spot where Vivec City would one day be built. \n"
"\n"
"Now you may ask, what wisdom was there in this? Why did not the great Vivec simply set this celestial rock softly down upon Nirn's verdant earth? But listen well, for there is a reason, as with all things the Three do. Every day our faith is tested by Baar Dau, and every day we show our love for Vivec and the Tribunal by keeping it aloft. Because it is our love, our devotion, our faith in the Tribunal that keeps it hovering above. It is proof of not only Vivec's might, but of the love of his followers. \n"
"\n"
"And so it forever hangs, a reminder to all. Together, now—Praise Vivec! Praise the Three!"

"\n"
"My Dark Elf companions smirk at me when I speak of it. They talk of the power of their great god Vivec, of his might and glory and magic. I know magic and I know of its end. Of its limits. What is their idol's limit? I fear to find out.\n"
"\n"
"Rumors swirl around the mountain like the ashy wind. Legends. Myth. But I have walked across Skyrim, where dragons once ruled. I am no stranger to the power of myth and the truth it holds. I am no stranger to the power of the true Gods.\n"
"\n"
"When I mention the Heart of Shor (or Lorkhan, as the Dark Elves know him), I'm met with laughter. There's something about seeing your god, about being his neighbor, that gives those in Vvardenfell a sense of entitlement. But what belief is to be had in what you can see? Faith is not given to what is provable in the world, but rather to what can only be truly felt in your gut. \n"
"\n"
"Still, they tell me what they know. Of greedy Dark Elf hands which found the Heart, which used it for their own ends. A magical stone, some say, nothing more. What it was used for I do not know, or if it still exists. So goes legends of a true God, which goes beyond mere mortal flesh.\n"
"\n"
"Some say the Heart still lies beneath that great Red Tower, but my Dark Elf companions remain unusually silent on the matter. I hear stories of treasure hunters delving deep into the dark passages, of the screams that never reach the surface. \n"

"I know in my heart that the great Red Mountain will never be defeated, will never give up its prize. Not until a true force of good emerges to claim it. Or, perhaps, a true force of evil."

"\n"
"Stand proud, kin of Hlaalu! You belong to one of the original Great Houses of the civilized Dunmer. From our capital in the city of Narsis, our influence extends throughout the central region of Morrowind. Some call us opportunistic like it's a curse. But as Grandmaster Hesleth always implored, \"The Dunmer who ignores opportunity deserves every failure that comes his way.\"\n"
"\n"
"From the earliest days of the House, Hlaalu focused on trade and crafts. Our maxim was simple. The goal for every housekin was to succeed in business and turn a tidy profit. The Book of Grasping Fortune reminds us to \"seize every chance to make a profit, but remember that your reputation also has value.\"\n"
"\n"
"Without huge armies or vast holdings, it fell to our housekin to become experts at diplomacy and negotiation. Our words became our strength. Oh, there were also the less-savory attributes that went along with fast-talking and deal-making. We became thieves and sneaks, blackmailers and backstabbers. Still, we always appreciated the value of the deal. As the Book of Grasping Fortune tells us, \"The perfect approach to negotiations is to compromise with an eye toward securing the best possible deal.\"\n"
"\n"
"Our influence and our wealth has always been distinguished by our willingness to live in peace with our neighbors. While there can be short-term profit in conflict and war, sustainable growth only comes from harmony and fair trade. It falls to House Hlaalu to acknowledge our Dunmer culture with one hand while using the other to adapt to changing conditions as necessary in order to succeed. And what is success? A satisfying deal and a tidy profit, of course!\n"
"\n"
"There is a dark stain on our history, however. Our natural tendencies encourage others to use bribes and favors to influence our housekin. This means that for every honest and fair councilor Hlaalu produces, there might be as many as four or five that are underhanded and corrupt. Does this concern us? Not overly, as history shows us that even the corrupt can wind up serving the common good. Or, at least, the profit earned has no moral component. As the Book of Grasping Fortune proclaims, \"You can trade with a friend forever, steal from a fool once or twice, and bargain with the dead not at all, so always go for the most sustainable profit.\""

"From the original formation of House Redoran, our housekin have held the virtues of duty, gravity, and piety most dear. A frivolous, soft life is not worth living. We focus on maintaining the traditions of the civilized Dunmer and holding fast to the way of the warrior. Our military strength, for example, outclasses the other Great Houses by a wide margin. Our prowess puts us at least one step ahead of them all and in most cases many more.\n"
"\n"
"For Redoran housekin, the driving goal is to fulfill your duty and maintain your honor. Anything less is a disrespect to yourself and your House. Beyond that, your duty is to your honor, your family, and your clan—in that order. \n"
"\n"
"Life is essentially serious and difficult. We must accept and endure the harshness of life, for that is the path of the Redoran. Reflect upon every event and action with thoughtfulness and sobriety. Remain stern, deliberate, and proud! For anything less is not Redoran."

"\n"
"House Dres, one of the Great Houses of the Dunmer, prized agrarian pursuits above all else. The House built its fortune on saltrice plantations and slave labor while maintaining a persistent tradition of Daedra worship and ancestor reverence. Dres controlled the southeastern region of Morrowind, even extending its influence into parts of central Morrowind. It was formally established as a Great House by Grandmaster Thalthil Dres after a successful slave raid that secured our role as the predominant suppliers of slaves to the other Houses.\n"
"\n"
"House Dres constantly resisted efforts to join Dunmer society with the rest of Tamriel. Proud isolationists, we nevertheless believed in the unity of the Great Houses. Our agricultural might fed Morrowind, providing the majority of the foodstuffs necessary for the existence and continuation of Dunmer society. As such, feeding Morrowind provided the bulk of our wealth and influence, supplemented nicely by our control of the slave trade.\n"
"\n"
"The isolationist stance of House Dres was instilled in its customs and world outlook from the very beginning. Not only do we consider the other cultures and races to be inferior to the Dunmer, we deem any extended contact with them where we were not in total control to present a danger to Dunmer society. Ideas, like a plague, can spread without warning and prove to be impossible to contain. Instead, we should concentrate on inter-House relations and improving the position of the Dunmer to make our society stronger and eternal."

"Yes, we are thankful for the mighty nix-oxen of our land. These gentle giants, a distant cousin to nix-hounds, were our salvation when we were forced to go without slaves, and have been the backbone of the farming community ever since. But have you stopped to think about what we are doing to these magnificent creatures?\n"
"\n"
"Unlike a slave, whose daily labors would only create callous and muscle, the nix-ox is forced to plow the land by dragging their pedipalps through the soil. This creates furrows for our saltrice, marshmerrow, and other needed crops. Many of our livelihoods depend on the quick growth and trade of these items. But what is the true cost of these goods?\n"
"\n"
"The nix-ox is not a beast of steel as the Dwarves once created, but a living, breathing animal. Over years of dedicated service, the nix-ox pedipalps begin to erode. Not only do they lose this important form of protection, they are then deemed useless by our \"good neighbor\" the farmer. They're left to starve in the ash wastes, or butchered for their carapaces. What a fine way to thank the being who put so many years of dedication into the very soil of Vvardenfell!\n"
"\n"
"\"But what can we do?\" you may be asking. \"Is there a better way?\" Fellow Housefolk, of course there is. There's always a better way.\n"
"\n"
"I believe that the law should require all farmers to retire nix-oxen after a certain amount of years of service.They then should be allowed a peaceful retirement, still given food and care by those who they have peacefully collaborated with throughout the years. They deserve all of the tasty mushrooms they can get their mandibles on, and peace and comfort in their twilight years.\n"

"\n"
"I made the immediate decision to destroy my creation. Yes, it was not inherently evil, or dangerous, or any of the traits normally associated with regrettable experiments. But it haunted me with its unnatural form, its protruding head, its fusion of scales and fur. I knew I had to destroy it.\n"
"\n"
"My deep sense of curiosity was my downfall. My mind was made up to undo what I had done, but I was too vain to let my experiment be destroyed before setting up at least the most basic of tests. I was in the middle of one when my darling little girl burst into my office with her daily demand for sweets.\n"
"\n"
"How this creature entrapped my daughter I will never know, but she was immediately besotted by it. She took that vile thing in her arms and began to coo.

Whatever is it called?\"\n"

"Sermon Thirty-Seven\n"
"\n"
"You have discovered the thirty-seventh Sermon of Vivec, which is a bending of the light, long past the chronicles of the Hortator who wore inconstant faces and ruled however they would, until apocalypse.\n"
"\n"
"Vivec was borne by ribbons of water, which wrote their starward couplings in red. This was a new place of speed. His eyes broke on the spikes above the tower, where the Void Ghost squatted over a drake-scaled drum, imbecile in its rhythm. And he asked of it:\n"
"\n"
"\"Who are you, that need no signature at all?\"\n"
"\n"
"Three in sum, the robes of Ayem stretched towards the bright black rim of memory, roping an arc of purchase. This was a new sprinting task. And Seht held his swollen belly to its name, clockmaker's daughter, swimming the dead confession along a century of thread, Naming her, uneaten, a golden cache of Veloth and Velothi, for where else would they know to go?\n"
"\n"
"\"Go here: world without wheel, charting zero deaths, and echoes singing,\" Seht said, until all of it was done, and in the center was anything whatever.\n"
"\n"
"And the red moment became a great howling unchecked, for the Provisional House was in ruin. And Vivec became as glass, a lamp, for the dragon's mane had broke, and the red moon bade him come.\n"
"\n"
"\"The sign of royalty is not this,\" a signal blueshift (female) told him, \"There is no right lesson learned alone.\"\n"
"\n"
"He refused the twine on her catching net, spiteful that an uncontinued people would not become fuller by their searching, and yet were wracked in their spirits for flight. But the male signals were offended, and Vivec took a fighting form. He undid his eastern light, saying to the ALMSIVI that through war, they had become brides in glass, which no power could observe. \n"
"\n"
"The light bent, and Vivec donned a cuirass made of red plates of jewel, and a mask that marked him born in the lands of Man. Wheeling, he spread into an insect salve, worn on the neck of hist-bulbs when at challenge. He roared up and fed his fingers to mammoth ghosts. The signal fires wondered if they mistook this for surrender, for Vivec had told the void that he could learn to undo it all.\n"
"\n"
"The light bent, and somewhere a history was finally undone. Of it, Vivec remembered the laughing of the netchimen of his village when the hunts were good. He marched with his father in the ash, growing strong in the hooks and sail, able to run a junk through silt. At eleven, he sung to an ashkhan. He became sick after Red Mountain, with the nix-blood and fever, and was infirm a hundred years. His mother survived him and laid his body at the altar of Padhome. She gave him her skin to wear into the underworld.\n"
"\n"
"The light bent, and Vivec awoke and grew fangs, unwilling to make of herself a folding thing. This was a new and lunar promise. And in her Biting she tunneled up and then downward, while her brother and sister smeared across heaven, thin ruptures of dissent, food for scarabs and the Worm. She took her people and made them safe, and sat with Azura drawing her own husband's likeness in the dirt. \n"
"\n"
"\"For I have removed my left hand and my right, he will say,\" she said, \"for that is how I shall win against them. Love alone and you shall know only mistakes of salt.\"\n"

"During a recent visit to the mainland, Lord Vivec became enthralled with the quaint and picturesque city of Ebonheart, in Stonefalls, on the northern coast of Morrowind. He spent an inordinate amount of time within the confines of the city, wandering the streets and carefully examining all of the buildings and houses located therein. Truth be told, the visit put us behind schedule and made me extremely anxious about upholding the rest of our commitments before we had to return to Vvardenfell.\n"
"\n"
"After remaining quietly at the Warrior-Poet's side as he tenaciously studied every cobblestone and patch of thatch, filling his notebook with every notion and observation, the Living God finally turned to me. \"Archcanon,\" Lord Vivec said, \"I am fascinated by this place. We must have one in Vvardenfell!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"We must, my lord?\" I asked, trying to ascertain where the Living God was going with this line of reasoning.\n"
"\n"
"\"I think that spot to the south of my city,\" Lord Vivec continued. \"Yes, that will be the perfect place to build my new Ebonheart!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Build, my lord?\" I asked, still somewhat unsure what was being asked of me.\n"
"\n"
"\"Build, move, whatever you think is best,\" Lord Vivec said. \"Have the canons and Hlaalu's engineers begin drawing up plans immediately. I can't wait to begin a new project!\"\n"
"\n"
"So, there you have it. From the lips of Our Lord to your ears, through the medium of this letter. I look forward to reviewing your ideas in, let us say, three month's time?\n"

"I once possessed a life of highest esteem. As a prominent champion of the Buoyant Armigers I brought prominence to my family and respect to my name. I expected to live out my days in service to Lord Vivec and the Tribunal without want or regret. I foresaw a glorious end for myself. An honorable death, fit for song, earned on the field of battle. How wrong I was.  \n"
"\n"
"With all that was known of Bal Ur, I should have expected our enemy to move quickly on what would be my final post. The vampires of Clan Aundae were aggressively seeking to reclaim locations important to their vampire heritage. They came upon us without making a sound, slaying most of the unsuspecting warriors under my command before any blades were drawn. My response was lacking and I have the blood of many respected Armigers on my hands because of it. \n"
"\n"
"Outnumbered and isolated, I yielded to my foe. The creature dressed like a gentleman, and I hoped for honorable treatment. I found myself a feast for a blood-drinking monster.\n"
"\n"
"Days passed in the depths of Bal Ur and in my dying delirium I began to dream. At first it was divine. I felt the warm coastal breeze of Vivec City unblemished by the shadow of Baar Dau. Love and kindness surrounded me as I saw the radiant visage of Lord Vivec approaching. I felt forgiveness, and peace, but as Vivec grew closer he twisted into something truly putrid, something vile beyond words. I soon recognized the sight of Molag Bal's pitiless grin before the Daedric Prince's fangs plunged into my heart. In my fright, I woke, shivering and colder than death, but it was the absence of thunder in my chest that revealed my affliction. My disease.\n"
"\n"
"Shamed by my corruption, and despairing of my own welfare, I passively acquiesced in my gradual integration into the affairs of Clan Aundae. I made no human my prey, only beasts, and kept myself apart from the other clankin; nonetheless, I abandoned hope and lived like a beast.\n"
"\n"
"Now, I find myself searching for some respite from this thirst. I must feast on the life blood of mortals to sate this gnawing agony, but to condemn another innocent to death, or worse. I would sooner leap into the flames of Red Mountain. Still, I am uncertain how long my self-loathing can hold back this need. Things cannot continue as they have. I have to do something. But what?\n"
"\n"
"Ashalmawia. My clankin murmur disapproval of the Worm Cult's claim over the ruin. They speak of rituals and offerings made to the shrine for the favor of the Lord of Troubles. I share my kin's disgust at these acts, but for very different reasons. I volunteered to keep watch over Ashalmawia and slipped away from Clan Aundae with barely an acknowledgment.\n"
"\n"
"I must not become used to this. It is easy to think of these cultists as vermin, but I am no less a monster for having slain them. Their blood is a balm, dispelling my agony leaving in its place vigor and bliss. Only in the aftermath do I find the presence of mind to revile what I have done. If I meet my end in this place, I will have deserved it. \n"
"\n"
"No, it would be more fitting for this wretched existence to be extinguished where it began. In this torment, my thoughts always return to Bal Ur. Perhaps I should as well."

I think they're trying to get it to unlock a component cache in the manufactory.\n"

"For every being, the Great Gear provides a set number of rotations, a set number of ticks before our natural clockwork mechanisms wear out and die. It's as inevitable as dusk giving way to dawn, but that doesn't mean we have to accept it. And I still have so much work left to accomplish. There isn't enough time in the day, let alone in a lifetime! I find this situation to be completely unacceptable.\n"
"\n"
"While my education started with the arcane arts, since Sotha Sil took me under his tutelage I've gravitated toward pursuits of a more scientific and mechanical nature. I have tried to apply these techniques to the problem, but so far my cogs and gears and widgets have failed to achieve any noticeable results. Gadgets and devices can accomplish wonders, but so far I have not found a suitable and compelling mechanism to prolong life in any meaningful manner. For this reason, I must return to my arcane roots and explore what magic may achieve where artificing has failed.\n"
"\n"
"I haven't let my magic grow stale, despite my concentration on more mechanical endeavors. Indeed, like my master before me, I tend to use magic to bolster the effectiveness of my mechanical creations. But it's through the concerted use of magic that I believe I can extend my existence. Why should the Tribunal alone get to be immortal when there are others (including myself) that have more than a lifetime of achievements to contribute to the betterment of society?\n"
"\n"
"Now, some may look down upon the magical arts labeled as \"dark,\" but knowledge and technique should never be dismissed out of hand. A use for every tool and a tool for every job, after all, as the Father of Mysteries always liked to remind me. So, my next great adventure shall be to conquer the intricacies of the dark arts and discover the secret to extending the natural lifespan. Who knows? Perhaps I might even discover the path to true immortality, if the gears align correctly.\n"

"The unfortunate events surrounding the demotion and subsequent banishment of Ulran Releth have left the High Council extremely disappointed.

In light of what occurred, the High Council requests a favor from you.\n"
"\n"
"First, since you often operate in the Balmora region, we'd like you to monitor Councilor Eris's actions for the relative future. We have every faith in Councilor Eris, but Ulran is his son, after all. Add to that the disturbing news about his daughter and the Morag Tong, and you can see why we have concerns.\n"
"\n"
"Second, since the promotion of Brivan Malrom to the rank of captain and commander of Redoran's western forces, we have received troubling reports of the unauthorized escalation of the use of mercenary companies, specifically Ferhara's Warclaws. Contract soldiers are expected to abide by all House laws and regulations, but Ferhara's mercenaries tend to deviate from standard practices on a frequent basis. We especially dislike hearing reports of excessive violence with regards to the treatment of Ashlanders. Harsh treatment, as you know, must always be authorized.\n"

In the meantime, I've sent them to scout the old fort west of Balmora to keep them busy.\n"

"Compiled by Scribe Dakin.\n"
"\n"
"Kund-Ud greeted Ashkhan Chodala as Gulakhan Yus-Zashten and Nibapor the Firebreather looked on. Chodala displayed no fear and showed Kund-Ud a level of respect rarely given to tribal outcasts. We had lent him the use of a small warband of Red Exiles, but now he was here to negotiate a more permanent arrangement.\n"
"\n"
"Chodala began the meeting by explaining his plans for tribal unification, stressing that there was a place for the Red Exiles in his unified vision.\n"
"\n"
"Kund-Ud demanded to know why the Red Exiles should even consider returning to the tribes that banished them. Chodala appeared thoughtful before he replied. \"Because you are Ashlanders, and our blood calls one to another.\"\n"
"\n"
"Then Chodala demonstrated the power of the staff our warband helped him acquire. He called the staff Sunna'rah. \"Sunna'rah grants me the strength of a god,\" Chodala said, striking a stone with the tip of his staff so that the stone cracked like the shell of an egg.\n"
"\n"
"Kund-Ud ordered his champion, Gulakhan Yus-Zashten, to put the blasphemous Ashkhan in his place. But no matter how many times her sword lashed out, it never once touched or pierced Chodala's flesh.\n"
"\n"
"\"What kind of creature are you?\" Kund-Ud demanded.\n"
"\n"
"\"I am the Nerevarine,\" Chodala proclaimed, and Kund-Ud, Gulakhan Yus-Zashten, and Nibapor prostrated themselves before him.\n"
"\n"
"\"The Red Exiles shall be my enforcers and Yus-Zashten shall be my champion,\" Chodala declared. \"Prepare yourselves for my return. I have much work for you to do.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Where are you going, Nerevarine?\" Kund-Ud asked.\n"
"\n"
"\"I need time to meditate upon our next course of action,\" Chodala said. \"Then I have a meeting with the Wise Woman Dovrosi to ratify my claim as the Nerevarine.\"\n"
"\n"
"Chodala departed and Gulakhan Yus-Zashten went with him, thus ending the meeting."

"\n"
"초달라는 회담을 시작하는 첫부분 부터 부족 통일에 대한 계획을 설명하였다. 그리고 그는 자신이 통일을 한 뒤 붉은 망명자들을 위한 장소를 마련해 주겠으며, 이미 그 장소 또한 생각해 놓았다는 이야기를 강조하였다.\n"
"\n"
"쿤타-우드는 붉은 망명자들이 왜 자신들을 추방한 부족들과 함께 해야 하냐, 왜 그들과 함께 돌아가야 하냐고 물었다. 초달라는 잠시 생각을 한 후 \"왜냐하면 당신들도 우리와 같은 애쉬랜더로서의 피가 흐르기 때문입니다. 애쉬랜더는 가족이며 피는 서로를 부르기 때문이지요.\" 라고 이야기 하였다. \n"

"It has been almost two years, but finally a break-through. Despite some initial missteps, I have managed to merge three tonal crystals into a single, master prism. If I can get it to consistently resonate, without cracking, I may be able to coax a sypathetic tonal wave out of it. Wouldn't that be a discovery for the ages! \n"
"\n"
"Sun's Height.3\n"
"The small scale experiment finally yielded results.  A sound that is subtle, not troublesome to the ears or man or mer. but pleasing to the Kwama. The prism appears to be withstanding the tonal forces perfectly. Would it affect the more acute hearing of the beast slaves working in the mine? If it affects them negatively, might that offset any benefit?  Sustainability is the issue. How to solve?\n"
"\n"

"I forced myself to show some humility today. I would truly be a fool to continue laboring on this prism while a trove of Dwemer artifacts gather dust in Mzanchend.

"From the Journal of Wandering Laborer, Bakozog gro-Shakh:\n"
"\n"
"Orcs catch it in the tusks, no question. Doesn't matter where I go. I could be hauling rope in Wayrest or laying bricks in Bergama. Wherever I travel, I hear it. \"Savage.\" \"Brute.\" \"Beast.\" It used to really tear me up. I'd look at my reflection in a bowl of water or a shop window and think \"you know, maybe they're right.\" But not anymore. Not since I moved to Vvardenfell.\n"
"\n"
"You want to get a good look at what \"savage\" really means? Come spend some time with the Dark Elves. Sure, they clean up well. Everything here is clean and polished and pressed. But if you pull back the curtain even a little, you'll see evil. And I don't mean a clumsy, childish evil. I'm talking about real evil—lusty, red-eyed, and smiling like a Daedra. Enslavement, murder, deception, cruelty—name a sin and you'll find it venerated. Name a Daedra and you'll find it worshiped. This island is corrupt, straight down to the marrow. Don't believe me? All right, let's talk about bugs.\n"
"\n"
"Vvardenfell is crawling with insects—some as small as a babe's toenail, and some as big as mammoths. That alone wouldn't be cause for concern. I mean, the echatere back home give some folks the creeps. Most of these critters are hard to look at. But the real horror doesn't come from the bugs themselves. It comes from what the Dark Elves do to them.\n"
"\n"
"Take the nix-ox. Never seen one? Picture a flea the size of a horse, propped up on six hairy stilts. Got it? That's a nix-ox. \n"
"\n"
"Far as I can tell, they're gentle creatures. They don't bleat or grunt like other pack animals. They just wander about, grazing on hardened mushrooms—cracking them open with their great big mandibles and lapping up the fungus inside the husk. Gentle giants, they are. Too gentle, I think.\n"
"\n"
"Early in the morning, while the beasts are still dozing, six or seven Dark Elves will descend upon the herd like a pack of greedy welwas. It doesn't take long for them to goad a dozen or so nixes into wheeled ox-pens. The leader of the crew will take a quick survey of the catch and mark their chitin with black chalk. Prices, you see? Of course, some don't get marked. Some are too frail or two small to be of use. Rather than letting the creatures go, one of the wranglers will jab them with a spear. Right beneath the chin, see? Then they kick them out of the pens and leave them to rot. The sad thing is that these are the lucky ones.\n"
"\n"
"Nix-oxen that make it to market are divided into two groups: Nix-Tovo, and Nix-Rima. Tovo oxen tend to be older and larger. You can snatch up two or three for the price of a single Rima. For the longest time, I couldn't figure out why. I finally asked one of the wranglers to explain why larger, stronger nix-oxen are so much cheaper. \n"
"\n"
"\"Hide's too thick,\" he said. \"Can't pry it.\"\n"
"\n"
"You see, an older nix's chitin is thick as oak bark. It cracks under pressure. Younger nixes' hides, however, are more pliable. With a bit of pressure, you can separate the plates to see the organs underneath. This access is what makes Rima oxen so valuable.\n"
"\n"
"Wealthier farmers hire specialists called drenlyns to \"train\" their nix-oxen. It's a softer way of saying \"break.\" The drenlyn bores into the poor beast's back with an obsidian drill, and pries open the flesh to expose a bundle of nerves resting in a cavity they call the \"drive chamber.\" They set a few hook-like prods into the viscera, and then reset the plates.

"I won't lie, it's hard to watch. But you know what the scariest part is? The scariest part is how bored everyone looks.  I looked into one of those drenlyn's eyes as he pried a nix-ox's back apart, and you know what I saw? The same face my daughter makes when she milks an echatere.  A weary, disinterested, nothing-face. Totally oblivious. Immune to shame.\n"

"I'll admit, I'm no green-child. I'll polish off a rack of spare ribs and wash it down with pig-gin without batting an eye. But digging around inside a beast's brains? Turning it into a zombie? It takes a black heart to do something like that. And you know what? Dark Elves do it all the time."

"Baar Dau looms large over Vivec City—both literally and figuratively. The official explanation is remarkably vague. Apparently, the Mad-Prince Sheogorath flung the giant rock at Nirn. No one seems to know why or how. It's a curious account, even by Dark Elf standards. I took the question to the streets to see what the common folk think of Baar Dau. These were their stories. Names have been changed to protect the speakers from Temple reprisals.\n"
"\n"
"I began by speaking to a harried Dark Elf merchant named Tolvasa. She stopped sorting kwama eggs just long enough to recount this tale:\n"
"\n"
"\"Oh, my mother used to tell me all kinds of bedtime-tales about Baar Dau. I doubt any of them are true. My favorite was 'The Tale of the Lonely Magna Ge.' It begins at the Beginning. In the story, a Star-Orphan named Una fled into the sky with all her brothers and sisters, but got lost in the dark. She cried out for help, but one-by-one, her stronger, faster kin fled into Aetherius. Eventually, their songs faded away and Una was left alone—adrift in the void. Just when she'd lost all hope, she heard a quiet sobbing. It was lonely Nirn, stumbling through the black—weeping like a babe and trying to lull itself to sleep. Seeing a kindred spirit, Una sailed back to Mundus to comfort the lonesome planet. She named herself Baar Dau, and nestled in close, right here above Vvardenfell. Now the Star-Orphan and Nirn are never lonely, because they have each other. Lovely story, isn't it?\"\n"
"\n"
"A Nord miner called Hodstag took a more pragmatic view:\n"
"\n"
"\"It's a goldmine, that's what it is! Mark me, there's some kid of precious metal in that thing. My mate's a geologist—works for the Gold Coast's mining operations, y'know? He says it's got all the signs of a rich deposit. He's got a divining rod, see? It's a Dwarf contraption, I think. I'm not supposed to talk about it. Anyway, he aimed it at Baar Dau and the thing started chirping like a snow-wren in springtime! All that's left to do is get up there with a few picks and get a sample. Been looking for someone who could float me up there—no luck though. Say, you don't know how to make a man float, do you?\"\n"
"\n"
"Of course, not everyone was keen to talk about Baar Dau. A grizzled longshoreman named Donoven had this to say:\n"
"\n"
"\"It's a rock. I don't know how it got there. Magic I guess? Look, I've got work to do, all right? Get lost.\"\n"
"\n"
"Most accounts were fairly prosaic. Given enough time and exposure, even the fantastical becomes mundane. Of course, there were a few truly extraordinary accounts—like that of Tiram, an excitable Dark Elf scholar:\n"
"\n"
"\"It's an egg, obviously. I often hear the wastrels and peasants calling it a 'rock.' Hmph. Ignorant twaddle. Only a great fool could look at such an imposing celestial body and call it a 'rock.' Baar Dau is the chrysalis from which will emerge the last child of Vivec and Molag Bal's ill-fated union. On that day, our glorious lord Vehk will spring forth from his temple and do battle with the emerging nightmare-child. After forty-seven days of pitched combat, Vivec will strike the final blow and cast the beast's ruin down into the frothing sea, where it shall break into thirty-six pieces—none of which will be recovered. It should be quite spectacular. And also horrifying.\"\n"
"\n"
"Perhaps the most colorful explanation came from an inebriated Orc named Narkhozug:\n"
"\n"
"\"What, that big rock? Yeah, it's a giant hunk of dung. No, seriously! Way I hear it, Vivec and Malacath were up late one night, drinking and talking about godly things. You know how it is. Well, I guess you don't. Anyway, Vivec said something about ogres that rubbed old Mauloch the wrong way, so he popped a squat over the city and dropped a stink-pickle right on Vivec's head! Gross, right? Hrmph. That's Malacath for you. Does make me wonder though, what is it with Malacath and dung?\"\n"
"\n"
"When I asked the Doctrinal Inquisitors for an official statement, this was the only reply:\n"
"\n"
"\"You'd be wise to leave such matters to the Tribunal. The precise nature of Baar Dau is a mystery. Vivec's divine mercy keeps it from destroying us. That is all you need know.\"\n"
"\n"
"Despite the Temple's best efforts, the moonlet Baar Dau remains the subject of vigorous debate, many long centuries after its arrival. The diversity of opinion is remarkable—especially in a city so thoroughly policed by religious zealots. I find it heartening that even in a society this restrictive, folk tales and wild theories can still bubble beneath the surface."

"From the notes of Pelagius Habor, Council Daedrologist-in-Residence, Imperial City\n"
"\n"
"Every true Daedrologist has a favorite Prince. We rarely admit it, but it's true. Each Prince, while horrifying, has a curious and often hilarious quirk. Sheogorath's peculiarities are well known, but when you really think about it, all the Princes are a bit silly. Hircine has the clumsy head of an ungulate. Sanguine is an inveterate drunk. It's precisely these eccentricities that make the Princes a source of endless fascination for Daedrologists such as myself. Unlike the stuffy and aloof Aedra, the Princes suffer from the same neuroses, flaws, and childish fixations that trouble men and mer. They are more like us than we care to admit. As for me? Of all the Daedric Princes, Clavicus Vile is my favorite—and it has everything to do with his loyal hound, Barbas.\n"
"\n"
"I have come to believe that Clavicus Vile is unique in that he exists in two persons. This is, of course, the subject of vigorous debate in Daedrological circles. Many of my confederates would argue that Barbas is merely a greater Daedric servant—no more linked to Vile than a horse is linked to its rider. But I urge you to consider the evidence. The first and most obvious proof of their consubstantiality is found in art. Crude, hand-carved idols dating back to the early Merethic Era depict the masked figure of Clavicus Vile standing beside a large hound, as do ancient cave paintings. I have explored the width and breadth of Tamriel in search of Daedric oddities, and in all my travels I have never found any depiction of Vile that does not include Barbas at his side. I've also read hundreds of firsthand accounts detailing encounters with the Prince. Each of those accounts, without exception, features Barbas in some capacity.\n"
"\n"
"If we accept the premise that Clavicus Vile and Barbas are (at least in some sense) the same person, the natural question is \"Why?\" Why would an entity possessing godlike power allow itself to be bifurcated? I have a number of hypotheses, but my best guess is simply this: companionship. The \"life\" of a Prince is one of near-total isolation. Some Princes, like Hermaeus Mora and Nocturnal, appear to revel in this solitude. But everything we know of Clavicus Vile indicates that he is a profoundly social being. His love of bartering, his willingness to bestow wishes upon those that engage with him, his bewitching mask—each of these things point to a being that thrives on interaction, conversation, and play. A being so inclined would likely go mad without some companion to speak to, argue with, and complain about. One might even view it as a marriage of sorts, albeit an inverted one. Rather than two becoming one, as in the Pledge of Mara, one has become two—a paradoxical reversal of the Aedric ritual.\n"
"\n"
"\"But why a dog?\" you ask? I've puzzled over this for years. Again, I can offer little more than supposition. My best guess is that it has to do with power roles. If Clavicus Vile sheared off a larger share of his animus to create an equal, the two would plot and scheme against each other constantly. In creating a canine counterpart, Vile ensures his position as master. Dogs are ancient symbols of loyalty and submission. They are servants and never masters. So it is with Barbas.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, Barbas is not always a dog. Like other Daedric Princes, Barbas can present himself in a number of different forms. He has appeared as both man and mer, as animals, lesser Daedra, even inanimate objects! This ability to bend his shape, but retain his fundamental animus is a power that no other Daedra on record has been able to replicate—aside from Princes, that is. Coincidence? I think not.\n"
"\n"
"We will likely never know Barbas's true nature with certainty, but the evidence points me to only one conclusion: Barbas and Clavicus Vile are one person in two forms. The master is also the servant. The handler is also the hound. It's a unique and fascinating paradox—the sort of mystery that makes Daedrology worth studying!"

"My masters are truly fools if they believe this scheme will make them rich. True, the substance produced by the formula looks and feels much like the rare ebony ore, but it is not ebony and any discerning craftsman will recognize this as soon as they use it to produce goods.\n"
"\n"
"I've tried to counsel Master Rethan on this subject, suggesting it may be wiser—and equally profitable—to instead focus on selling the alchemical concoction itself. Though the formula was exceedingly difficult to translate and requires extreme precision to brew properly, the reagents I require to produce it are not overly rare. I could easily produce large quantities. Imagine my airborne form used as a weapon! It would fetch a fine price.\n"
"\n"
"Master Rethan disagrees. According to him, the buyers don't care if the ebony is false. So long as they can use it to produce goods that pass a cursory inspection they will be happy. Ebony is quite rare and difficult to come by. With us as the source, our buyers should be able to produce passable fakes then close shop before anyone discovers the deception. If a soldier dies on the battlefield because his ebony plate was not true, that's no money out of our buyers' pockets. \n"
"\n"
"Perhaps Master Rethan is right. I often underestimate the crude avarice that drives so many of my race. As for me, I am content to study and work with such a brilliant formula. Perhaps one day I will find a truer application for it."

"Mean Old Torchbug lived near the kwama mine. He loved to taunt and tease the kwama workers, but especially enjoyed getting Brave Little Scrib into trouble. Oh, he was never obvious about his trouble making, and for the most part, the Brave Little Scrib considered the tiny Torchbug to be her friend. If Brave Little Scrib took a moment to consider all the times she wound up punished because she listened to Torchbug, she might have felt differently about the mean little creature. But the Brave Little Scrib never thought much about such things. It wasn't in her nature.\n"
"\n"
"One day after she grew bored watching the Kwama Workers busily move the kwama eggs from one section of the hatchery to another, Brave Little Scrib ventured out of the mine. It was a beautiful day, sunny and warm, with a gentle breeze blowing through the mushroom forest. Kwama Warrior stood guard at the entrance and asked her where she was going. \"I'm going out to play,\" she answered, which she thought was totally obvious to anyone other than the serious Warrior.\n"
"\n"
"As Brave Little Scrib entered the mushroom forest, she saw a glowing light hovering above the trail ahead. It was her friend, Mean Old Torchbug, though she never called the tiny insect such a horrible name. \"Hello, tiny Torchbug,\" Scrib called out.\n"
"\n"
"\"And greetings to you, Little Scrib,\" Torchbug sang, his voice like a crackling fire. \"What brings you out of the mine on this beautiful day?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I've come to play,\" Brave Little Scrib said cheerfully. \"The mine is dreadfully dull as the workers are constantly busy, and all the warriors want to do is fight and fight and fight. I'm looking for an adventure!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"An adventure?\" Torchbug asked gleefully. \"I know just the thing to fill your day with excitement and provide me with an amusement to brighten up my afternoon.\"\n"
"\n"
"Remembering the other suggestions Torchbug shared with her during the time they'd known each other, Scrib asked suspiciously, \"What do you have in mind?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"There's a mage tower nearby, in one of the tall mushrooms. The mage that lives there is always looking for a brave little scrib to play games with. She knows the most interesting games.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"What kinds of games?\" Scrib asked, suddenly excited despite her suspicions.\n"
"\n"
"\"Oh, the best kind, I assure you!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Then lead the way, tiny Torchbug,\" Scrib said, and she followed the glowing insect deeper into the shadows cast by the looming mushroom spires.\n"
"\n"
"As Brave Little Scrib followed Torchbug toward the mushroom tower, she noticed a pile of empty jars heaped haphazardly near the tower's base. She stopped to inspect the jars, sniffing at the sticky-sweet residue that clung to the discarded vessels. \n"
"\n"
"\"Is something wrong, Little Scrib?\" Torchbug asked, flitting back to hover above the piled jars.\n"
"\n"
"\"There's something familiar about this smell,\" Brave Little Scrib said, \"but I can't quite place it.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"That's just the remains of the jelly the mage likes to spread on toasted bread. In fact, that's one of the games she loves to play when brave little scribs come to call.\"\n"
"\n"
"Now, Brave Little Scrib isn't the most clever kwama in the mine, but she has her moments. This was one of them. \"You want to watch the mage turn me into scrib jelly, don't you, you Mean Old Torchbug?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Of course,\" Torchbug sang. \"I so want to see how the jelly gets made.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I think we'll save that for another day, Torchbug,\" Brave Little Scrib said.\n"
"\n"
"\"If you insist, Little Scrib,\" Torchbug sang. \"Have a good day.\"\n"
"\n"
"And Brave Little Scrib raced back to the kwama mine, leaving Torchbug in the shadows with the empty jars. That was one adventure she was glad to miss!"

"Finally, the guar reached the orange glow. Alas, it was not a campfire, but a great flow of lava. The guar, so seduced by the warmth, gave this truth no heed.

"The alit was heartbroken. \"I will never have a friend as long as I have these terrible teeth!\" it hissed. The beast resolved to be done with them altogether. It took a huge rock in its mouth and bit down hard—knocking out all its teeth like a box of loose nails. \"Finally,\" it sighed \"other beasts will no longer be afraid!\"\n"

"Just then a great Kagouti arrived, stomping its feet and preparing to pounce. The alit growled and opened its wide jaws to frighten the predator away, but the kagouti just laughed. \"You fool!

"Councilor Eris Redoran,\n"
"\n"
"As you requested, I prepared this primer due to recent events involving the ancient guild of assassins known as the Morag Tong. You wanted to know everything available about the guild and its members in order to make informed decisions concerning how to respond to current activities aimed at our Great House. The guild personifies the darker aspects of Dunmer life, celebrating murder in the name of Mephala. Surprisingly, the group was created to curb violence and prevent the always contentious House politics of Morrowind from escalating into full-scale war. Since such a war has yet to erupt, I suppose you could say that the Morag Tong has thus far been a successful experiment.\n"
"\n"
"The Morrowind government sanctioned the Morag Tong long ago during the First Era, and to this day they continue to perform tacitly legal assassinations, utilizing a system of contracts known as \"honorable writs of execution.\" Under the established laws, no member of the Morag Tong can perform an execution without a writ detailing the exact target and purpose for the sanctioned murder. Maintaining an air of impartiality in regards to House politics, the Morag Tong carries itself with all the weight of a cherished and ancient institution. Members never act on their own accord and cannot take on missions of their own choosing. Instead, petitions for services are sent to the guild's Grandmaster for examination and consideration. If the petition is accepted, an honorable writ of execution is prepared and awarded to a Morag Tong member. From that point on, the contract's target is dead and just doesn't know it—before long the assassin makes contact and completes the deadly transaction.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike other killers or even those crazed fanatics that belong to the Dark Brotherhood, the Morag Tong assassins admit to their acts and proudly brandish their honorable writs of execution after each kill. These writs pardon a Tong member of any legal entanglements that may occur in the administration of the associated contract. Indeed, by law, a Tong executioner must step forward and proclaim that a kill was performed legally and to the letter of the contract, thus absolving him- or herself and averting any subsequent ramifications related to the act. The Tong claims to provide no safe harbor for criminals, so any member that does not comply comes under investigation and internal punishment.\n"
"\n"
"The origins of the Morag Tong remain shrouded in legend and conjecture. All I have been able to ascertain for sure is that the group emerged during the bloody House conflicts of early Morrowind, establishing the writ system and rising to prominence by the end of the First Era. The guild reached the height of its power about two-hundred-and-fifty years ago, operating openly across Tamriel and attaining a reputation as unparalleled, reasonable, and honorable killers. The group became too sure of itself, too confident of its position. After a number of high-profile assassinations of monarchs and great lords that frightened the Tamriel nobility, the Tong retreated back to its holdings in Morrowind and vanished from the public eye for more than a century. Today, the group maintains a subdued presence in Dark Elf lands, taking select contracts as they work to reestablish their name and reputation with the Great Houses.\n"
"\n"
"The organization of the Morag Tong hasn't changed much over the years. A Grandmaster leads the guild, who then grants power to each guild hall's master to accept and assign writs. Note that individual members cannot accept a contract without approval, however, and the guild masters have proven over the years that they take great care when deciding to accept a contract. One possible avenue to explore should the conflict between House Redoran and the Morag Tong escalate is the group's affiliation with Mephala, the Daedric Prince of lies, deception, and murder. While the organization is sanctioned and their heretical ways mostly overlooked by the Tribunal, Ordinators and Buoyant Armigers will deal with these heretics swiftly and brutally if they catch them in the act of committing murder. I leave that for you to decide.\n"

"Few embody Lord Vivec's spirit of adventure and exploration as proudly as the Buoyant Armigers. This military order of the Tribunal Temple serves Lord Vivec with dedication and heroic zeal. Oath-bound to emulate the Master of Morrowind's command of the varied arts of personal combat, chivalric courtesy, and subtle verse, these warrior-poets stand as the champions of the Temple and Vivec's personal knights-errant. They take on specific missions when available and wander the land in search of adventure when nothing else requires their intervention. The Buoyant Armigers perform their deeds and noble exploits in the name of Lord Vivec, even while they engage in a friendly rivalry with the more solemn Ordinators.\n"
"\n"
"Most members of this knightly order come from the ranks of House Redoran. The noble ideals and sense of adventure match closely with the virtues of the House, so it's not surprising that Redorans are drawn to Vivec's service. Take, for example, Elynea Omayn, the proud daughter of a House Redoran councilor. She could have found a place as a high-ranking officer in the Redoran military or as a Redoran representative to another Ebonheart Pact nation. Instead, her daring and love of complex verse led her to join the Buoyant Armigers. A favorite of Lord Vivec and an inspiration to her fellow knights-errant, Omayn visits Vivec Palace often but rarely remains for longer than a day or two at a time. Then it's off on another mission or in search of her own adventure so that she can add more verses to her ever-expanding ballad of amazing exploits.\n"
"\n"
"\"Knight Omayn, fair and pure, came upon some nix-ox spoor,\n"
"Of quantity immense and odor intense, \n"
"Such offal could only have come from something extremely hostile.\"\n"
"\n"
"The ballad goes on to describe how Elynea Omayn encounters her rival and sometimes lover, Ordinator Nisath, also on the trail of the monstrous nix-ox. The two exchange friendly jabs and engage in bawdy innuendos as they make their way into a desolate canyon after tracking the enraged creature's path of destruction.\n"
"\n"
"\"Ordinator Nisath, with a mighty sword and a weapon to match,\n"
"Was eager to add such a terrible beast to his ever-growing catch.\n"
"But Knight Omayn spoke faster, assaulting the creature with a barrage of banter,\n"
"Confusing, inspiring, her wit and words ended the threat and averted disaster.\"\n"
"\n"
"Vivec encourages his knights-errant to hunt down and eliminate necromancers, blighted creatures, and the assorted champions of dark forces throughout the land. He expects them to remain true to Vivec's ideals while quoting from the warrior-poet's writings or crafting their own verse as they seek out adventure. Novice members of the order don the traditional chitin armor of the Dunmer. In contrast, more renowned knights adorn themselves with more expensive Daedric or even glass armor.\n"
"\n"
"Whereas the Ordinators stand somber and alert, Vivec's Buoyant Armigers leap and bound enthusiastically as they search for adventure. Gushing with ostentatious bravado and dashing flamboyance, the typical member of the order is valiant, fearless, well-read, and a master of verse and rhythm. They revere Lord Vivec who, in turn, blesses them with preternatural courage and a flare for dramatic performance. When our Lord Vivec requires agents to complete an important task or deal with an impending threat, he never hesitates to call upon his loyal and faithful Buoyant Armigers."

"Dear Thane Vigli Storm-Breast,\n"
"\n"
"Honored leader of the Nord Cultural Exchange, it is I, Rigurt the Brash, writing to you in Windhelm as you requested. I continue my study and exchange of information with the little Dark Elves of Morrowind, as you ordered. (Why you sent Rigurt away after he only just arrived, I don't completely understand, but I suppose my mission is very important.) As I set foot—well, both feet, really—into Vvardenfell, the thought of this mission makes Rigurt so excited! Trading culture with allied nations so that we can learn more about each other is almost better than cold mead on a hot day. Almost. This time, I travel to learn more about the Tribunal—the so-called Living Gods of the Dark Elf people. The wonderment of it all gives Rigurt the skin bumps!\n"
"\n"
"Now, unlike our good and proper gods of Skyrim—gods who listen to our prayers but have the good graces to stay out of Nord business—the Dark Elf gods actually walk among the people and rule over them the way the Skald-King parades around Windhelm. (No offense, Skald-King!) The god-kings of Morrowind seem to answer to various titles, although the most common appellations appear to be \"Lord, Mother, and Wizard.\" Rigurt spent many long hours attempting to converse with knowledgeable little Dark Elves, but much of what they told me just made my head go spinny-spin. Here's what I learned about the Tribunal gods. Maybe you can make better sense of it all.\n"
"\n"
"The most popular of the three, at least in Vvardenfell, is the warrior-poet, Vivec. They sing his praises in the cornerclubs and shout his victories from the rooftops. Really, the faithful on every street corner eagerly shoved pamphlets containing his lessons and sermons at me if I so much as smiled in their general directions! Lord Vivec is called the Master of Morrowind. I tried to read some of his poetry, but it just made my eyes hurt. Not at all as interesting or bawdy as the great Fjokki, and full of allusions that any who aren't drenched in Dark Elf culture just wouldn't understand. Truth be told, even I—Dark Elf expert that I am—had trouble with some of the more esoteric concepts. He preaches duty to faith, family, masters, and all that is good. He saved his people on numerous occasions, including helping to repel at least two Akaviri invasions—most recently, the invasion that led to the creation of our cherished Ebonheart Pact. He apparently has some sort of connection to the Daedra Mephala, who the Dark Elves call one of the \"good Daedra.\" He does have a dark side, though, as I've been told that he has an unnatural attraction to lustful thoughts and murderous intentions. So, not very different from the rest of the puny Dark Elves, right? He lives right here in a grand palace in Vivec City, which conveniently has the same name that he does. I spent a few minutes in his presence, but I couldn't help but stare at his strange appearance. Also, he tended to float around the chamber. As a tactic to make us mortal creatures feel inferior, it worked surprisingly well. Still, I was happy to have been able to spend some quality time with such a personage of "
"impressiveness!\n"
"\n"
"Next, I tried to discover everything I could about the one they call Mother Morrowind, Almalexia. Now, it turns out she mostly inhabits the temple in Mournhold, so I wasn't able to get a face-to-face with the Dark Elf patron of healers and teachers. I admit I'm very disappointed, as I am given to understand that for a goddess, she's the elk's antlers! They also claim that she embodies the best of Dark Elf culture and determination, which would fit into my area of expertise quite nicely. One priest told me that she protects the poor and the weak, and that her wisdom guides the Dunmeri through all their affairs. A drunk Dark Elf in a cornerclub also mentioned that she was kind of a stick in the mud, but an Ordinator dragged her away before I could ask what she meant by that. Oh well.\n"
"\n"
"The most mysterious of the three god-monarchs is Sotha Sil, also known as the Mystery of Morrowind and the Wizard of Wonderishness. (I believe that's what the priest called him. I misplaced those notes and am writing this last bit from memory while having a few mugs of mead.) Although rumors abound, no one that I could find has claimed to have seen Sotha Sil in a horker's age. The best I could learn from asking around is that Sotha Sil is the patron of artificers and mages, and many—especially Dark Elves—consider him to be the most powerful magicka user in all the land. I even heard an amazing tale about a city of clockwork gears that Sotha Sil crafted to study the inner workings of the world. And they claim it's only as big as a small mammoth! Now that's something I'd give my last rabbit meatball to see! He's also credited with negotiating some kind of compact with a number of Daedric Princes, but I decided not to look too deeply into this rumor. As Fjokki says, the fool who stares gets noticed by the Daedra. Rigurt is not so foolish as to do something as stupid as that! (Did you roll your eyes, Thane Vigli? I bet you rolled your eyes.)\n"
"\n"
"The three living gods of the Dunmeri empower the Tribunal Temple and embody the will and discipline of Dark Elves everywhere. Well, except for the Ashlanders, who refuse to bend their knees to Vivec, Almalexia, or Sotha Sil. Some sort of family squabble, I imagine. I'll look into that while I'm here.\n"

"\n"
"The Order of the Watch provides protection for the Tribunal's temples and shrines, as well as stationing guards at Tribunal towns and cities, including Vivec City. In addition to policing Tribunal settlements and guarding Tribunal holy sites, Ordinators of the Watch enforce Temple law. These Ordinators are the most visible of all the orders, interacting with the populace on a regular basis.\n"
"\n"
"Militant scholars comprise the Order of Doctrine and Ordination, vigorously studying the words of the Living Gods and supporting the will of the Tribunal. They serve as arbiters of the reigning doctrine and oppose false and dangerous views, such as those held by the Nerevarine Prophecies and other dissident teachings.\n"
"\n"
"The Order of Inquisition seeks out and actively suppresses heresy among Temple priests and Dark Elf citizens alike. Serving as both an investigative body and judge and executor, members of this order place heretics on trial and then deal out whatever punishment is deemed appropriate for the crime against the Tribunal.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, the Order of War battles the enemies of the Temple in all its forms, including hostile cults and Daedra worshipers operating in Dunmer territory. The holy soldiers are among the finest, most-dedicated, and best-trained warriors in all of Morrowind, blessed by the Tribunal itself and charged with defending its will. \n"
"\n"
"I suppose there's another arm of the Ordinators, though there are so few of them that they don't qualify as an order unto themselves. Selected personally from among the most skilled warriors in the Tribunal Temple to serve as Almalexia's elite agents in the world, the Hands of Almalexia, the living goddess herself fortifies them with divine magic and enchants their fearsome armor and weapons.\n"
"\n"
"House Indoril, always orthodox and strident supporters of the Tribunal Temple, provides the majority of the Dark Elves that take up the armor of the Ordinators. In fact, the house's influence can be seen in the distinctive style of the Ordinator armor, and its sons and daughters proudly serve the Tribunal with dedication and reverence. Of course, the Ordinators don't have a monopoly on service to the Living Gods. Take, for example, Lord Vivec's Buoyant Armigers. I shall cover them in a subsequent volume."

"성스러운 경비병이자 싸우는 사제인 오디네이터는 트리뷰날 성당과 그곳에서 숭배하는 살아 있는 신을 위해 봉사하고 있다. 4개의 기사단으로 조직된 오디네이터는 트리뷰날의 의지를 모로윈드 전역에 퍼뜨리는 임무를 맡고 있다. 그들은 특이한 황금 갑옷과 가면으로 자신들을 특정짓고 있다. 얼굴을 덮어 보호하는 표정이 없는가면은 경비병들의 신원을 감추고 오디네이터들에게 위협적인 기운과 신비로운 분위기를 조성해 준다.\n"
"\n"
"오디네이터는 4가지의 기사단으로 나뉘는데, 트리뷰날 영토 내의 권한은 소속에 의해 결정된다. 각자 감시의 기사단, 교리와 질서의 기사단, 심문의 기사단, 전쟁의 기사단이다.\n"
"\n"
"감시의 기사단은 트리뷰날의 성당과 사당을 보호하고, 비벡 시티를 포함한 트리뷰날 시내와 도시에 경비병을 파견한다. 그 뿐만 아니라 트리뷰날 정착지의 치안을 유지하고 트리뷰날 성지를 보호하며, 감시의 기사단의 오디네이터는 성당의 법률을 집행한다. 이들 오디네이터들은 모든 기사단 중 가장 눈에 띄기 쉽고, 정기적으로 대중들과 교류하고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"교리와 질서의 기사단은 군사학자들로 이루어져 있다. 이들은 살아 있는 신의 말을 열정적으로 연구하고 트리뷰날의 의지를 지지하고 있다. 그들은 지배적인 교리의 결정권자로서 섬기며, Nerevarine의 예언이나 다른 이단적 교리 같은 거짓되고 위험한 견해를 반대하고 있다. \n"
"\n"
"심문의 기사단은 성당의 사제와 다크 엘프 시민들 중 이단을 찾아내 강경하게 탄압하고 있다. 이들은 수사기관과 재판, 집행의 역활을 전부 수행하는 본 기사단의 구성원은 이단을 재판에 회부하고 성당에 거역한 죄에 걸맞다고 판단되는 처벌을 내린다.\n"
"\n"
"마지막으로, 전쟁의 기사단은 던머 영토에서 활동하는 적대적인 교단과 데이드라 숭배자를 포함한 모든 성당의 적과 싸우고 있다. 성스러운 병사들은 모로윈드 전역에서 선별된 매우 헌신적이고 최고의 훈련을 받은 병사들로, 트리뷰날의 가호를 받아 그 의지를 보호할 책임을 지고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"오디네이터에는 다른 병력도 존재하지만 그 수가 적어서 기사단을 구성하지는 못하였다. 그들은 트리뷰날 성당에서 능력이 뛰어난 전사들에게 개인적으로 선별되어 Almalexia의 뛰어난 첩보원으로서 Almalexia의 수호자 역할을 맡게 된다. 살아 있는 여신이 성스러운 마법으로 그들을 강화해 주고 갑옷과 무기에 마법을 부여해 준다.\n"
"\n"
"언제나 정통적으로 스티뷰날 성당을 지지하는 인두릴 가문에서는 오디네이터에 참가하는 대다수의 다크 엘프를 배출해 왔다. 사실, 안두릴 가문의 영향력은 오디네이터 갑옷의 독특한 방식을 보면 알 수 있다. 그들의 아들딸은 헌신감과 존경심을 가지고 자랑스럽게 트리뷰날을 숭배한다. 물론 오디네이터들만이 살아 있는 신을 숭배하는 것은 아니다. 예를 들어, 비벡 경의 Buoyant Armigers가 있다. 이에 대해서는 다음 권에서 다루도록 하겠다."

"By Ravosa Ildram, House Healer\n"
"\n"
"I have been asked by the prominent noble from Rotheran, Ulasa Redoran, to expound upon the bane of long-suffering Dark Elves everywhere—skin blights. These pox care little for economic or social standing. Poor or rich, young or old, skin pestilences can affect anyone and seem to have a preference for the Dunmer complexion. They range from mild annoyances to destructive infestations that leave disfigurement and even death in their wake. The Council of Dunmer Healers, where healing masters from each House gather to exchange information and work together to deal with plagues and diseases at the behest of the Tribunal, have dubbed all skin-related illnesses as \"corprus,\" using the ancient Velothi word for \"skin blight.\" \n"
"\n"
"Like other plagues that ravage the land, corprus maladies have both natural and unnatural origins. Sometimes an alchemical or even magical version of a blight gets loose to devastate the public. Take, for example, the Flay Blight of 2E 565. Throughout that long and scorching summer, a terrible affliction ravaged the western shore of Vvardenfell. Hundreds upon hundreds of Dark Elves contracted rashes that irritated the flesh and blotched the skin. After an extensive investigation by the Council of Healers, it was categorically concluded that the Flay Blight was the direct result of a change to the alchemical formula of Mystic's Majestic Face Cream.\n"
"\n"
"As to why the Dunmer integument seems to be notoriously susceptible to corprus maladies, well, the best I can offer is theory and conjecture. Some believe that the Dunmer people are \"ill-favored by fate,\" which makes us particularly predisposed to skin blights and other irritations. Others claim that our ruthless and distrustful nature makes our blood run hot, allowing all manner of disease to breed and take root in our bodies. As a healer, I have found no clear proof of such thermal differences between a Dark Elf or, say, an Orc or Nord. (Although we do appear to run warmer than Argonians, but that's a subject for another report.) There are also those who hold to the \"old religions\" and see corprus and other blights as direct evidence of Malacath's fury against the Dunmer. The God of Curses, they believe, tests us by sending affliction after affliction that pushes our physical prowess and overall health to its limits.\n"
"\n"
"As a healer and alchemist, I try to leave myth and religion outside when I enter the realm of methodical theorizing. My studies, which include treating afflicted Dunmer and reviewing the work of reputable healers throughout Morrowind and the neighboring lands, lead me to conclude that most natural corprus outbreaks—including inflammation and discoloration, as well as flaking and sloughing of corrupted flesh, or an outbreak of blisters or ulcerations—appear to be the result of unsanitary conditions, unbalanced humors, or miniscule creatures of foul and ill-tempered disposition. Of course, many of my colleagues scoff at such theories, preferring to believe that every action results from either the interplay of magicka or the movement of celestial bodies or other more traditional views of healing and sickness.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the best method for avoiding corprus blights of all varieties is to bathe often, wear clean garments, and eat and drink only the purest of foods and liquors. If it makes you feel any better, you can also mutter a protective prayer to ward off Malacath's unwanted attentions. The Tribunal knows such arcane rituals probably won't make your chances of contracting a blight any worse, and they'll probably make you feel more comfortable."

"By High Ordinator Vermethys\n"
"\n"
"An Ordinator's every action must reflect the divinity of the Tribunal. Every thought, word, and gesture, no matter how trivial, must glorify the Three. Our appearance, too, must bring honor to ALMSIVI. Herein you shall find a guide to liturgical vestment.\n"
"\n"
"At the beginning of the vesting, an Ordinator must wash herself thoroughly, using mineral water from one of Red Mountain's sacred hot springs and a volcanic pumice. This act has profound spiritual significance. In washing the body, the Ordinator also washes the soul—removing residual sin and any nagging doubts that might interfere with the merciless application of Tribunal law.\n"
"\n"
"Once the washing is complete, the proper vesting can begin. \n"
"\n"
"The Ordinator begins with the rathith—triangular linen small clothes, dyed a deep blue and fastened with brass pins. The rathith is further secured by the arnith, the golden \"underbelt\" which is also secured using brass pins. Daughters of ALMSIVI are also permitted to wear the alrathith, a second garment tailored to support the breasts.\n"
"\n"
"With the rathith and alrathith secured, the Ordinator is free to move on to the llananor, or \"second garment.\" This long shirt must be washed in sacred mineral water before the sun rises, and pressed thrice over a hot stone. When donning the llananor, the Ordinator must also recite the Litany of Three Virtues. If the Ordinator completes the litany before the shirt is fully donned, they are obliged to repeat the litany twice more before moving on to the next step of the vesting.\n"
"\n"
"The Ordinator's pants, or felassani, must also be washed and thrice pressed before wearing. Ordinators should put on these trousers starting with the left foot and must fasten them using a blue, rope-like belt called a nosa. The slippers must likewise be worn starting with the left foot, and laced with gold ribbon.\n"
" \n"
"Finally, the Ordinator must drape a crimson wool stole, or duleso, about the neck and shoulders thrice, and fasten it with a triangular golden reliquary clasp—a neleviso. This ends the first vesting, or llanathro'lani, and prepares the Ordinator for armor-suiting.\n"
"\n"
"Before the holy armor can be donned, the Ordinator must recite the Forty-Six Canticles of Supplication, and appeal to St. Nerevar the Captain, patron of warriors and defender of Dunmeri society, for protection. After receiving Nerevar's blessing, the Ordinator begins armor inspection.\n"
"\n"
"The Armor of Triune Faith must be free of any nicks, dents, stains, corrosion, or other aesthetic imperfections. Even minor blemishes are affronts to ALMSIVI's divine persons. Ordinators found wearing imperfect armor shall be subject to severe sanction. \n"
"\n"
"The polish should be thorough and uniform, but not garish. The chitinous undervest must be rubbed with an oiled cloth and flexed to prevent aging and distress.  Furthermore, the Ordinator should oil all joints, and treat all leather with a firm brushing and a liberal application of kwama-wax armor dressing. At this point, the Ordinator should signal an initiate to prepare for armor fitting.\n"
"\n"
"The initiate begins with the sabatons and greaves (starting with the left) while reciting a prayer to St. Rilms, patron of pilgrims. Once this devotional is complete, the initiate proceeds to the cuisses, reciting another prayer to St. Meris, patron of laborers. At this point, the Ordinator must anoint the breastplate with sacred mineral oil and recite another prayer of supplication to blessed St. Nerevar before handing it over to the initiate. After fastening the cuirass, the initiate moves on to the rerebraces and couters, reciting another devotional to St. Aralor the Penitent. After securing and lacing the pauldrons, the inititate should glove the Ordinator, starting with the left gauntlet, all the while reciting a prayer to St. Delyn the Wise. Finally, the initiate must drape the blue prayer stole, or retheles, over the warrior's shoulders, reciting a final prayer to St. Felms the Bold. This accomplished, the assistant is permitted to retreat to the chapel for post-vesting prayer.\n"
"\n"
"Final armor preparations are left to the Ordinator herself. Using the left hand, the Ordinator must tuck a sprig of bittergreen beneath her right pauldron. Using the right hand, the Ordinator must trace the sign of the Tribunal on her chest—gnashing her teeth and hissing thrice, at each point of the triune to summon up the wrath of the Tribunal. The tinder of faith thus kindled, the Ordinator anoints the Golden Mask of Devotion with mineral oil, presses her forehead to the helm to likewise anoint herself, then dons the helm. Ordinators may now arm themselves with any weapon, so long as it is thoroughly cleaned, and thrice blessed before use. \n"
"\n"
"At this point, any action of the Ordinator is protected by divine mandate. So long as she wears the mask, the Ordinator is considered a faultless hand of the Three, and is authorized to commit any martial action deemed necessary to protect the True Faith. Hands of Almalexia and other specialized members of the order may have additional vestments to wear, but any servant of the Three thus vested is considered a full Ordinator.\n"
"\n"
"Keep to this guide, stay earnest in your prayers, and you will bring naught but glory to ALMSIVI.\n"
"\n"
"Victory for the Three."

"Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of one of Vvardenfell's most recognizable and loyal pets! If this is your first nix adoption, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the do's and don'ts of nix-hound ownership. Stick to these tried and true methods, and you'll have a happy and healthy companion for years to come!\n"
"\n"
"Feeding:\n"
"Nix-hounds are voracious eaters. After emerging from its chrysalis, a baby nix can drain at least four comparably sized creatures per day! Be sure to rinse your pet's proboscis after every meal, as the scent of fresh fluids can attract wild nixes.\n"
"\n"
"Baby guars, goats, kwama pupae, and ash hoppers are all excellent sources of nutrition. Just be sure to get rid of those pesky meat-husks when you're done. A drained animal is the perfect treat for wild alits, and no one wants an ornery ball of teeth wandering around their yard!\n"
"\n"
"One final note at this crucial stage in development. It's very important to keep small children and other pets away from your new companion. Baby nixes are very curious, and won't hesitate to spear smaller creatures in search of food. An innocent case of mistaken identity can result in tragedy, so keep an eye on your little ones!\n"
"\n"
"Grooming:\n"
"Nix-hounds place great value on cleanliness (welcome news for most pet-owners!). The average nix spends hours self-cleaning—using its nimble pedipalps to scrape and polish their facial chitin and antennae. Unfortunately, the length of their proboscis and the relative thickness of their neck make it very difficult to reach the rest of their abdomen and thorax. That's where you come in! You should give your new friend a good scrub with an oiled rag once every two weeks. Just be careful to avoid the nix's sensory seta and abdominal glands. Nixes have been known to slip into a violent rage if touched in the wrong place. But don't worry! Given a few days and a dozen or so buckets of meat-fluid, your pet will regain its charming disposition.\n"
"\n"
"Be sure to check for ash mites in between their thoracic junction and spiracles as well. These little pests can drive even the friendliest nix into an itchy frenzy!\n"
"\n"
"Exercise:\n"
"Nix-hounds require lots of stimulation and exercise. Like their industrious cousins, the kwama, nixes are addicted to work and productivity. So play along! Games like \"hide the dung,\" and \"who's got the spleen\" will keep your nix busy and satisfied for hours at a time!\n"
"\n"
"Handling:\n"
"Nix-hounds are affectionate and attentive pets, but here are a few more tips for keeping them calm and collected:\n"
"\n"
"Always remember to face your nix when feeding it.\n"
"\n"
"Avoid direct eye contact while your nix is relieving itself.\n"
"\n"
"Make sure your friends and neighbors don't leave their pets and children unattended around your nix.\n"
"\n"
"Never shout at your nix.\n"
"\n"
"Never whisper to your nix.\n"
"\n"
"Never show another nix excessive attention or affection.\n"
"\n"
"Avoid contact with the nix's saliva, as it is corrosive and may form a permanent bond with the skin.\n"
"\n"
"Never display any signs of physical weakness around your nix.\n"
"\n"
"Conclusion:\n"
"We hope this short guide has been informative. Nix-hound ownership is a real treat, and an experience that you won't soon forget! You'll enjoy your time with this beautiful creature, we guarantee it!"

"\n"
"Listen, child of the Tribunal! Do you not hear the whirr of the gears? The hiss of the pistons?  It is the voice of Sotha Sil, calling you to the Nirn-Ensuing. To the Tamriel Final. Anuvanna'si. Cast down your worldly maths. Loosen the chains of your selfish pursuits. Shall I describe it to you? Shall I guide your eyes to the future of Nirn? Hear the words in sequence, dark child. Close your eyes and awaken!\n"
"\n"
"Gaze up to behold a crystal sky, girded and bound by Seht's bright bands. Look down to behold the black stone of His will, and His imagination made clay. Drink His truth, thick as blood, from the broad black rivers. Feel His breath on your skin—let its dreamy redolence fill your nostrils and sting your eyes. You stand at the center of the wheel. The home of the Mainspring Ever-Wound.\n"
"\n"
"Obsidian towers stretch ever skyward, festooned with polished brass and godly filigrees. Great turbines drive memory through a thousand thousand pipes that stretch out like tangled veins, or the golden roots of an ageless tree. And wandering amidst the humming and hissing paradise are His second-children. The Fabri'siraynosim. The merged-ones. Birthed of the unsequence, and bound to the Nirn-Ensuing. They cry out in one voice: \"Death to Multitudes! Woe and terror! Let the fragments melt in the Boiler of Unknown Angles! Let the falsehoods burn in the Furnace of Forgotten Numbers! Disassemble and cleanse! Dismantle and make whole!\" They are the guardians—the ever-wound key-lords. Only the Nameless heart avoids their wrath. Their hatred of discord knows no limits. For the road to Tamriel Final is not a bloodless one, child of the Tribunal. Anuvanna'si. Contemplate this with a pious heart. Seek a clean and well-oiled soul. It shall serve you well in His truth-to-come.\n"
"\n"
"So you see the Clockwork City is like Sotha Sil Himself—rich in beauty for the faithful, and alight with sublime terror for the servants of chaos. In which Clockwork City would you reside? Commit your small blasphemies and think on this.\n"

"\n"
"Speak not of Dwarves, child of the Tribunal. The simple clockworks of the Dwemer pale before the sublime machinery of Sotha Sil. Let Dumac's lament be a silent one. Let his hissing tombs stay buried. Let his automata rust and crumble. For his was the greatest failure—driven by Lorkhan's Great Lie and churlish pride. His is a tale of woe and terror, and those that pursue his ugly maths shall pay a great price in blood.\n"
"\n"
"\"But, was Dumac not a creator?\" you ask? \"Were the brass-child's hands not covered in oil? Did they not speak the words of Making, and set wheel to axle?\" Hear the words in sequence, followers of Seht. Intention dictates the worth of a machine. Where the Mainspring Ever-Wound seeks the convergence of the Nirn-Ensuing, the ghosts of the Dwemer cry out: \"Multitudes! Multitudes!\" Mer and machine, parted. Wisdom and ambition, parted. Made and Unmade, parted. And from those sunderings, a thousand thousand skittering machines are made—left to wander forgotten halls, aimless and profligate. One may twist a knob left in preparation for another to twist the same knob right. One may loosen a pipe so that another may tighten it. They exist only to maintain the brass-childrens' folly, and so they are redundant and profane in the Eye of Sotha Sil.\n"
"\n"
"But most profane is this: the walking horror that bears the Name, NM. The Brass Tower of Vanity. The mindless guardian of the Nirn-Prior. The Antipodal-God-Thing that reigns on the darkest pole of the sacred Nirn-Sphere. Of all the threats to Tamriel Final, NM is the greatest. Anuvanna'si. The Daedra can be banished in thought, but NM must be sundered on Nirn. It is the welded knot at the center of Anu that must be untied. The God-Puzzle. The Mainspring Ever-Wound remains silent on this point. And where there is silence, there is great wisdom.\n"

"Now I speak to you of Sotha Sil's silence. The children of ash sometimes ask, \"Where is our Clockwork God? Why does only the Tourbillon speak His truth in mortal sequence?\" They ask in hushed tones, with brows creased by fear. Do not flee from such questions, child of the Tribunal. These are the little blasphemies that lead to wisdom—the faultless flame that turns ignorance to steam. For the Mainspring Ever-Wound is the Father of Curiosity, and curiosity is the joyful destroyer. Only in sundering can things be made whole. Only the disassembled engine can be scrubbed and made clean. So, smash the old machines! Topple your mind's idols! And from the wreckage, assemble new truths—flawless and water-tight.\n"
"\n"
"Do you see now, child of the Tribunal? It is the silence of Sotha Sil that gives birth to the intrepid mind. Knowledge must be found—and to find a thing, it must be hidden. It is not enough to be told. The whirr of the machine is as silence to the one who lives within it. A turbine ever-oiled does not know the lack of oil—does not know the purpose of oil. And so it is with truth.\n"
"\n"
"Now, you must know that curiosity is not without cost. ALM forgive this heresy! VI forgive this heresy! I speak the words in sequence only. Pay heed to the laws of golden masks, but know also their limits. Pay heed to the songs of dancing glass, but know also the boundaries of their scale. Their truth is the truth of inertia. Of gravity. Their hearts are vessels filled with liquid brass—resistant to harm, but incapable of movement. The Mainspring Ever-Wound spurns that which does not move. In the Nirn-Ensuing, that which does not move shall be fed to the Kiln-Amaranthine where Seht's quiet wrath burns like the sun, and broken cogs are made whole. The Wheels Eternal must spin. The Tamriel Final must tick and tock. Anuvanna'si. Each and each must take its place in the whole. For if even one piece is missing, the whole is not whole.\n"

In the days before the First Ignition, the Chimer people bent their knees to the False Princes: The Webspinner, the Prince of Plots, and the Queen of Dawn and Dusk. I do not use their names, as Name cleaves one from another. You know them well, child of the Tribunal, for every time you bear false witness, or make foolish boasts, you do so in their name. Their words corrode and weaken the heart. Their threats loosen the fasteners and break the seals. They are the Anti-Gears that turn counter to the Nameless Will. Servants of the Padomaic untruth whose nature is void. Of the Daedra, only the Gray Prince of Order knew his nature, and he went mad in the knowing. \n"

"The Daedra fear wisdom and order, you see? And thus do they fear the Clockwork God above all others. Where others see dark crowns numbered ten and six, Sotha Sil sees shadows and nothing more.

Si, the Divine Engine, whose mind merges \"they\" and \"we\" and births the Nirn-Ensuing. Lesser wills are wisps of smoke, born and lost in a sea of endless sky. Lost children whose freedom is death.\n"
"\n"
"For what is freedom, child of the Tribunal? The counter-lever to slavery? No. Have you not heard the words in sequence? The chrononymic will is the pendulum that swings only once. It cannot do otherwise. To swing twice would break one intention from another and prove the blasphemy of two. As Padomay is illusion, so too is the named will. For what is \"choice\" if not chaos? What is \"free will\" if not the lack of order, vulgar and triumphant? The true wheels spin clockwise, ever clockwise. In the unity of Nirn-Ensuing, each belongs to all, and all belong to none—save Tamriel Final. Anuvanna'si. So lay down your cheap burdens, child. \"Shall I do thus?\" Such \"choice\" is delusion. Give yourself to the pursuit of unity, for in the end, you cannot do otherwise.\n"

"Taken from the sermons of Deldrise Morvayn, Fourth Tourbillon to the Mainspring Ever-Wound.\n"
"\n"
"By the word, I wind the gears.\n"
"\n"
"How does one come to know the Clockwork God and Father of Mysteries? Our Lord Vivec and the Lady of Mercy, Almalexia, are known to us. Their faces are known to us. Their words are known to us. But what of Sotha Sil? He who is distant in both position and intent. Ever watchful, but seldom seen. Ever worshiped, but seldom heard. He is the Mainspring Ever-Wound—the unmoved mover, hidden within His Clockwork City, whose voice is the Divine Metronome. As Tourbillon, I speak His truth as I know it. I say the words in sequence so they can be known by the people. The sequence is but a shadow of the truth, but minds such as ours cannot bear the ordered unsequence. Minds such as ours cannot truly know themselves. Not yet.\n"
"\n"
"The First Truth of the Mainspring Ever-Wound is the truth of Nirn. The soul of Nirn has two faces. The first is known to us—the Nirn-Prior, or the Nirn of Many Parts. It is a Nirn in pieces, assembled by the unsteady hand that has yet to find itself. Its oscillations irregular, its going train disrupted by fear and delusion. Its faults are not in its parts, but in its assembly. Each gear is a god. Each spring is a thought. But a mechanism built by many hands cannot know the precision of the master craftsman. The et'Ada Gears cannot bring forth a true Nirn, because they know only its parts. They cannot see the whole. The Eye of Sotha Sil ignores such division. Where the broken gods see only pieces, our Father Sotha Sil sees the whole. He sees the Second Nirn.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Nirn. The inchoate Nirn-Ensuing. The thought-form that anticipates the world to come: Tamriel Final. Anuvanna'si. Only Sotha Sil knows its shape. Its nature lies forgotten in the before-time when Anu broke itself for wisdom's sake. Our lessers know the Source as two forms: Anu and Padomay, but this binary is without merit. One of the Lorkhan's Great Lies, meant to sunder us from the truth of Anuic unity. Our father, Sotha Sil, would have us know the truth: there is no Padomay. Padomay is the absence of value. The lack. A ghost that vanishes at first light. A Nothing. There is only Anu, sundered and known by many names, possessing many faces. The one. \n"
"\n"
"When Anu broke itself, it did so to understand its nature. In its sundering, the values that swam in its vastness thought to know themselves. The et'Ada Gears gave themselves many names and set their will to building. Alas, they heeded the counsel of Lorkhan and forgot the face of Anu. They thought themselves distinct and whole. And so, many hands assembled the world, each with separate intention and selfish purpose. The Nirn of Many Parts was the result. A broken and leaking steam-ship that lists ever wind-ward.\n"
"\n"
"But rejoice, children of the Tribunal! In His wisdom, the Mainspring Ever-Wound seeks to reclaim our lost heritage. His heart is oiled and calibrated, pumping dark truth as blood. His mind is the God-Mortar where the fractured values of Anuic nature are ground and weighed—unified through His will alone. From this great labor, a new Nirn will be born. Tamriel Final. Anuvanna'si. I pray that we see the fruit of His labor—a perfect world, without et'Ada Gears. Without the illusion of change. Water-tight and everlasting.\n"

Leave that to other, less talented drudges! No, my beshackled friends—by displaying basic reasoning skills and only a mild interest in talking trees, you've earned the right to aid the Telvanni in the glorious future of magical practice!

There is a chance (albeit a remote one) that even minor exertion could cause your lungs to spontaneously erupt in flame, but I'm counting on your bizarre lizard physiology to withstand the effects. (I am assuming you have lungs. I must remember to do a thorough search of the Argonian chest cavity at the next opportunity.)

"\n"
"I have, may it please the Tribunal, a few words to say before you render sentence.\n"
"\n"
"First, as in all things, I praise the Tribunal. It is with a pious heart that I stand before the Three. Many here assembled have accused me of heresy, treason, and murder. But I tell you now, everything I have done—everything I have ever done—I have done for the greater glory of the Tribunal.\n"
"\n"
"With respect, I must point out the hypocrisy which sends me to my death. Had I taken up the sword in defense of the rich, or the Temple, or my House, the sacrifices I have made would be rightly celebrated. My neck would be draped in dragontongue and ribbon, not left bare, awaiting the axe. But because I acted on behalf of the bound and wretched, I am damned.\n"
"\n"
"The scourge of slavery is the defining sin of our people. While the Redguards prize their swords and the Wood Elves prize their trees, we prize our blood-property. We built our Houses on the backs of a proud and mysterious people whose lives we destroy with reckless abandon. We think ourselves better than them because of our true faith and our smooth skin. But I tell you this: there is more goodness in the heart of one Argonian laborer than in all the hearts of all the landed oathmen of Morrowind combined. \n"
"\n"
"Our Lady of Mercy, Blessed Almalexia, teaches us compassion and charity, but are we not like the gluttonous netches that kill out of greed? Are we not like the child-Seht who makes sport of suffering?\n"
"\n"
"The esteemed Inquisitor asked me this under oath: \"Are you not ashamed of what you have done?\" I remained silent at the time, but now I say it freely: I feel no shame at all. I have no regrets. While I lament the death of those overseers, I tell you it was all for the good. One day soon there will come a reckoning. All our manifest sins will swell and consume us. We will deserve it.\n"
"\n"
"Kill me if you wish. If I must forfeit my life in furtherance of justice, I say \"let it be done!\" But know this: you kill me in vain. Others will rise to take my place. The sons and daughters of Black Marsh will be free. And unless you change course, the children of the Tribunal will pay a great price in blood.\n"

"By Vorinara Kleeve, Dwemer Scholar\n"
"\n"
"While we know a great deal about the various forms of Dwemer animunculi, many of the larger Dwemer marvels remain a mystery. Legends of Dwemer orreries and fabrication chambers abound, but direct, first-hand scholarship remains scant. I have spent my life in search of these Dwarven mega-structures. While I've met with considerable success, there is one mechanism in particular that I am keen to find: the Dwemer Tonal Resonator.\n"
"\n"
"At the height of their power, the Dwemer exhibited near total mastery of tonal forces. Even now, countless centuries later, they remain peerless in this respect. Sound, not magic, facilitated their rise to power. I am continually astounded by tonal forces' wide range of uses. The Dwemer used sound in mining, medicine, architecture—even psychology. It's the latter use that I find most intriguing. According to ancient Chimeri scholarship, the Dwemer could employ tonal forces to bend weaker minds to their will—a form of complex aural hypnosis. Luckily, the Dwarves never managed to mobilize this technology on the battlefield against our august ancestors. The scale and complexity of the devices likely made transportation nearly impossible. But they still managed to employ it on a limited scale using massive devices called Tonal Resonators.\n"
"\n"
"If the legends are true, these resonators were incredibly complex architectural wonders. They stood taller than the most imposing giants, and filled cavernous chambers with pipes, dials, and pistons. When enabled, the resonators released a series of powerful tones that could alter the brainwaves of lesser mer and men—inducing deep calm and profound pleasure, or even paranoia and terror. The uses for such a device are virtually limitless. Alas, I fear that I will never see one with my own eyes. If such a power could be replicated and perfected, the children of the Tribunal could very well reign supreme in Tamriel and continents beyond."

"The last group of prisoners you sent me to work my fields have proven less resilient than I'd hoped. They are, without exception, lazy, slow, and dull-witted. Then again, no one ever said Bretons and Bosmer make good slaves. I miss the days when you could buy a dozen strong Argonians for the price of a sturdy wagon.\n"

"As soon as possible, I'd like a few of those strong Nords you sent over to Kharekh. As she and I have both agreed to your \"work for compensation\" plan, we both deserve an equal share of the resources. I refuse to settle for lower quality workers. Send me only your strongest and brightest.\n"

"By Narsis Dren, Treasure Hunter\n"
"\n"
"Ah, devoted reader! Back for another tale of the amazing Narsis Dren? Of course you are. Why else would you be here, right now, holding this exceptionally crafted tale? Let's get to it, shall we?\n"
"\n"
"I was investigating an ancient Nord barrow, searching for the Glittering Garters of Gwenyld the Gauche (or something along those lines) when I stumbled upon an ominous lever that opened a hidden door. Now, I wasn't exactly sure what the lever was going to do when I pulled it, but you know my motto—Leave a lever, lose a lord. (Trust me, it makes a lot more sense in the original Ayleidoon.) A hidden door slid open when I activated the lever, revealing a secret room that had thus far eluded even the most determined tomb robbers. (Tomb robbers, by the way, tend to be reticent when it comes to pulling ominous levers. That's why Narsis Dren is better than they are. It's all about the bravery.) \n"
"\n"
"The secret room was a spacious affair, full of funeral finery and relics from a forgotten age. One item that stood out was a ring of pure iron, covered in Nord runes. It was probably small for a Nord's thick fingers, but it seemed nearly large enough to fit upon my Elven wrist. I slipped the ring into my pack and turned to examine the rest of the chamber, immediately noticing the massive sarcophagus placed strategically in the center of the room. It was all carved stone with inlaid jewels and Nordic runes that matched those decorating the iron ring. Obviously, this was the final resting place for an important jarl, king, or even a dragon priest. My mind boggled at the possibilities of what awaited inside that stone coffin. But I have learned from experience never to reach blindly into the honey pot. Instead, I carefully studied the sarcophagus, looking for any noticeable traps. When a visual inspection failed to reveal anything out of the ordinary, I began to gingerly examine the seam where the great stone lid met the deeper casket. Using my handy collection of picks and probing rods, I tested the entire circumference of the lip of the lid. Nothing.\n"
"\n"
"Is that when I finally hefted the lid to peer inside? Not so fast, devoted reader! I had one more investigation to make before I opened the tempting sarcophagus. I had to study the intriguing runes that covered the lid. I suspected they dated back to at least the Neo-Meadic era of Nord history, and perhaps even older. The trick to decipher old runes is finding one or two bits that you recognize and starting your translation with them. In this case, I spotted a rune that looked remarkably like the current pictograph for \"foul\" or \"stink.\" Beside it was a symbol I was certain meant \"spell\" or perhaps \"magic.\" So, at least a portion of the intricate runes said something along the lines of \"foul spell\" or \"stinky magic.\" I deciphered the rest of the runes without even needing to read them. It proclaimed that the sarcophagus was protected by an ancient Nord curse of the most odorous kind.\n"
"\n"
"Curses, however, have never hindered the great Narsis Dren! Yours truly has defeated all sorts of assorted tomb guardians, insidious traps, and hostile rivals. What's an ancient Nord curse to someone as amazingly competent as me? Not worth worrying about, I assure you! I was neither frightened by the curse nor dissuaded from pursuing my usual course. I placed both hands upon the sarcophagus lid as I prepared to slide the heavy stone aside. That's when a strange and not terribly unpleasant tingle ran up and down my arms and a bright white light filled my eyes. When the light faded, I found myself inside a cramped, cold space, surrounded by dry stone and total darkness. Somehow, I wound up inside the still-sealed sarcophagus! Perhaps I had dismissed the threat of the curse a tad too soon.\n"
"\n"
"\"Hello,\" I said hopefully. \"Is there anyone out there?\" I knew that there wasn't. My lackadaisical assistant was outside, lounging around our campfire and probably drinking deeply from my most expensive flask of flin. At least there wasn't a body inside the stone coffin with me. That would have been awkward. I pushed with all my might, but the lid wouldn't budge. Now, lesser men would crumble at a moment like this, but Narsis Dren is not a lesser man. Quite the opposite. He's a better than lesser man! When I get into situations like this, I always ask myself, \"Self, what would Narsis Dren do?\" And then it came to me. The iron ring! Its runes matched those on the sarcophagus. There had to be a connection. I strained to reach my pack, then dug around until I found the iron ring.\n"
"\n"
"I drew the ring out of my pack, holding it firmly with determination and dramatic purpose. I touched the ring to the stone lid. Nothing happened. I admit, that was a little disappointing. With a sigh, I slipped the large ring onto the second and third fingers of my left hand. I said the word \"Open\" out loud, annunciating the syllable over and over as I worked my way through every language I knew. Again, nothing. Now I was beginning to become disheartened. I made a fist and touched the lid with the ring while rapping my forehead upon the cool stone three times in fast succession. Why? Oh, just chalk it up to the old Narsis Dren instinct. Another flash of white light obscured my vision. When it cleared, I was standing outside the sarcophagus, back in the secret chamber.\n"
"\t\t\n"
"The moral of my story? Avoid tempting sarcophaguses at all costs. They're usually more trouble than they're worth."

"\"I didn't come all the way to Vvardenfell just to see the sights, councilor,\" Investigator Vale said as she examined the bust of Almalexia that sat atop Councilor Vobend's desk. \"Although I must say I find your land and your people to be quite enticing.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Then why are you here, Vale?\" Councilor Vobend demanded, his tone indicating that he was out of patience with the woman from High Rock.\n"
"\n"
"\"Because I asked her to come, Father,\" said Velnea, the councilor's daughter, as she strode into the chamber. \"I care about what happened to Master Adren, even if House Hlaalu would rather pretend that he never existed.\"\n"
"\n"
"Vobend collapsed heavily into his chair, suddenly exhausted by the weight of his responsibilities. \"We've been over this a hundred times, Velnea,\" Vobend sighed. \"Master Adren died. It happens. Not every death hides a conspiracy or a murder.\"\n"
"\n"
"Investigator Vale gave Velnea a dazzling smile before turning back to address her father. \"I'll be the judge of that, my dear councilor,\" she said with evident excitement. \"After all, it's what I do.\"\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Vale and Velnea walked side by side beneath the massive mushrooms that towered behind Master Adren's alchemy shop. The old alchemist had been Velnea's beloved mentor since she was a young girl, instructing her in the alchemical arts as well as encouraging other academic pursuits. There was a garden toward the back of the area, displaying a harvest of plants and flowers favored by alchemists. An easel was set up nearby, holding a canvas that showed the alchemist sitting beside his beloved garden. The painting was not quite finished.\n"
"\n"
"\"Adren always told me I could be anything I wanted to be,\" Velnea mused. \"I didn't have to become a merchant or a trader if my father's life didn't appeal to me. He … encouraged me to … dream.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Sounds like he was a wonderful person,\" Vale said cheerfully as she marveled at the nix-hound that wandered over to investigate the strange visitor. \"And what is your dream, dear Velnea, if you don't mind me asking?\"\n"
"\n"
"Velnea blushed, hesitated, and stepped over to the unfinished painting. She said, \"I want to be a painter. I love to draw, and Adren helped me develop my talent. Landscapes, portraits, still lifes … I've created quite a body of work and he said that each new painting was better than the last. I was in the middle of this one when …. I miss that old alchemist. A lot.\"\n"
"\n"
"Vale bent down to examine the ground beneath one of the tree-like mushrooms. \"And this is where you found the alchemist?\" she asked.\n"
"\n"
"Velnea shivered and clutched her arms tightly. \"Yes. I came by to visit. When I couldn't find Adren inside his shop, I assumed he had come out here to read or tend to his garden. Instead, I found him lying there, face up and eyes open. I'll never forget the sight of him.\"\n"
"\n"
"The investigator stood up and scanned the rest of the backyard. \"You said nothing was missing? Hmm. According to your painting, one of the flowers has disappeared.\"\n"
"\n"
"Velnea looked at the unfinished painting and saw the vibrant and exotic bloom rising from the patch beside the image of her mentor. Then she examined the garden and let out a squeak of surprise. \"You're right! I can't believe I didn't notice that before! It's gone!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"And if your depiction is accurate, the missing plant is a rare crimson dragonthorn,\" Vale said. \"A much sought after plant when it comes to alchemy. And this discoloration on the stem of the mushroom. That indicates that the surface of the fungus interacted with a garlic snail and produced a plume of noxious gas. Quite toxic, as I understand it.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"A garlic snail? In Adren's garden? He was too good a gardener to allow such a pest to take root among his mushrooms,\" Velnea said.\n"
"\n"
"\"Then murder it is, my dear,\" Vale said. \"Tell me, did Adren have any rivals among the local alchemists?\"\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Investigator Vale entered Dirani's flower shop and walked confidently toward the older Dark Elf who was busy working on a floral arrangement that included flora and fungi. Following behind Vale were Velnea and a House Hlaalu soldier. Vale paused to sniff at the arrangement-in-progress before she stepped over to a large pot containing freshly turned soil. Sticking out of the soil was a crimson dragonthorn.\n"
"\n"
"\"Well, that's an extremely rare flower,\" Vale said, bending to examine the plant more closely. \"And look. It has the same small yellow dots on the petals, just like in your painting, dear Velnea.\"\n"
"\n"
"Dirani looked from Vale to the soldier and back again, clearly nervous and sweating uncomfortably. \"What … what are you implying?\" she eventually managed to stammer.\n"
"\n"
"\"I never imply,\" Vale said, placing her hand on a glass case sitting on the counter. The case contained a small colony of garlic snails. Vale tapped the side with one long, slender finger. \"I'll say the words plainly. You murdered Master Adren so that you could acquire his prized crimson dragonthorn.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"That's … that's preposterous!\" Dirani protested. Then she turned and ran out through the back of the flower shop. The Hlaalu soldier followed quickly after her.\n"
"\n"
"\"She's going to get away,\" said Velnea, disappointment evident in her sad voice.\n"
"\n"
"\"Nonsense, my dear,\" Vale said. \"Your soldier seems more than capable of apprehending an old woman. Now what do you say? I'd love it if you'd paint my portrait. Tell me, how do you feel about nudes?\""
