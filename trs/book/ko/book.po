"By the Omen of a Hundred Prophecies\n"
"\n"
"'Twas in Menevia, dear, green Menevia, there dwelt a young Breton of family and name. He had inherited a patrimony, and thus needed to do nothing, as others were paid to do for him. And so he sat at his mullioned window and gazed out the diamond panes at the colors of the countryside as they changed with the light. And he dreamed away the day, until the colors darkened and he betook himself to bed, where he slumbered and dreamed in truth.\n"
"\n"
"Of what did he dream? He dreamed of his own land, but in colors more intense, more true, and more pure than in day. His Menevia of Dreams was more real than his Menevia of Waking, and he felt more alive when asleep than awake. Each day at his mullions, he looked and longed for a way to dream beyond dreams—a way to live in his Reverie-Menevia forever and forever.\n"
"\n"
"\"Reverie-Menevia,\" he said, and it was a prayer. \"Reverie-Menevia. Reverie-Menevia.\" A thousand, thousand times he uttered this prayer, and it changed like a dream to \" 'Ver'-Menevia, 'ver'-Menevia,\" and more and more it became less and less, until at last, \"Vaermina,\" he said, and \"Vaermina,\" and  \"Vaermina\" again.\n"
"\n"
"And to him she came in Dream-Form, Vaermina Herself, and called him Supernal Dreamer, and First Nightcaller, and named him Omen of a Hundred Prophecies. And when he awoke, he yet did dream, and spoke as in a dream, and called other dreamers to him, and to Reverie-Menevia.\n"
"\n"
"And soon you shall join him. The Nightcaller has dreamed it. One night you shall dream, and in your dream you will say the Name. And She will come."

"1st Morning Star: \n"
"A new year, and a new start. Sirune agreed to be my betrothed last night! I'm the luckiest mer in Mathiisen. I've already made arrangements with Yondin to use the forge. I'm going to melt down my father's old blade and use it as the base for a Ring of Mara. Mathiisen steel is good enough for the troops, right? It will be good enough for my true heart.\n"
"\n"
"3rd Sun's Dawn: \n"
"The Heralds are shouting in every square across the island. There's a new Queen! And we're now part of some kind of Alliance—with the Wood Elves and the Khajiit, of all people. \"The Aldmeri Dominion,\" they're calling it. I couldn't be prouder, but father has done nothing but grumble. He says letting \"those kind of folk\" onto the island will be bad for business.\n"
"\n"
"10th Sun's Dawn: \n"
"Sirune and I sneaked out in the middle of the night and made for Skywatch. It was so exciting, bedding down by the side of the road. Like we're in the Fighters Guild! The handbills telling of the parade have been all over the island, and we decided we couldn't let something like this pass us by. I'll be thrice-cursed by the old mer, I know it. But damn him for a fool. Miss a chance to see the Queen, the Mane, and the Bosmer Treethanes? Not on your life.\n"
"\n"
"11th Sun's Dawn: \n"
"If today was any indication, Father was right. The parade was amazing, with Her Majesty leading a phalanx of Marines up the path to the gates. Then came the Treethanes, with their wily jungle rangers. Vinedusk, I think someone said? And then the Mane, with those braids! Amazing to see the Khajiiti warriors on display.\n"
"\n"
"Much more pleasing than the furry sneak-thief I caught with his hand in my coin-purse. I tried to catch him before he made off, but he dove between some of those damned dock workers who were so obsessed with their frog races they didn't even look up. And then he was gone. Sirune said it was all right, that we'd just leave earlier than we'd planned. Damn it. Just hate to let her down.\n"
"\n"
"17th Sun's Dawn: \n"
"Damn them all! Everything has been a mess since Sirune and I came back from Skywatch. Father was furious that we'd left, and when I told him how many coins that cat took … old bastard hasn't beaten me like that since I was learning the forge. \n"
"\n"
"Then, a few days ago, they pulled all of us into the forgemaster's office. Condalin had gotten word that, with the new alliance, tradesmer can start hiring some of \"those folk.\" Tossing a certain number of jobs to \"them\" would net you extra coin from the Thalmor. \n"
"\n"
"And so he dropped father's contract! Been with the forge for decades, and now cat-men and cannibals are doing the job. All because of this damned alliance. Father's beside himself, about the steel more than anything. Says they won't know how to cure it right. Stars above, what's happening?\n"
"\n"
"2nd First Seed: \n"
"My life is ruined. I'm on the run, and everyone I knew and loved hates me. Damn the \"Dominion\" and our smiling Queen to boot!\n"
"\n"
"It all started when that recruiter for the Battlereeve came to town. He was looking for volunteers for the Dominion military. When no one came forward, he said he'd been empowered to take conscripts. He tapped me and Sirune's brother. He also grabbed the twins, Taleril and Tanaril. Shoved us into a line with a gang of others and started us down the road.\n"
"\n"
"We weren't a mile before Tanaril snapped. Went crazy, screaming about how he couldn't fight Dark Elves, that they use your body to hatch spiders in. He made a break for it, and a bunch of us used the chance to run as well.\n"
"\n"
"I'm holed up in a cave near Silsailen. My father is penniless. My bride-to-be will soon think me a traitor. The damned cats and runty Elves are taking over the island, and the military is putting children on the front lines. This isn't the homeland I grew up in!\n"
"\n"
"5th First Seed: \n"
"I was reduced to trying to steal something for my evening meal, and—of course—I was caught. I slipped into Silsailen after dusk, the smell of some delicious whitefish wafting on the breeze. I hadn't eaten anything worthwhile since the morning the recruiter came into town, when I had that delicious spiced bread Sirune's mother made. \n"
"\n"
"I slipped into town and tracked the smell to the local inn. I was trying to figure out how to get into the kitchen when a big beefy hand fell on my shoulder. One of the Canonreeve's men. He knew exactly what I was doing, almost like he'd been watching me since I got into town. Now I'm sitting in a cell underneath the reeve's manse, waiting his justice. At least they let me keep the journal here.\n"
"\n"
"Damn you, Ayrenn! Damn you, Dominion!\n"
"\n"
"10th First Seed: \n"
"My old life is over. And my new life under the Veil has begun. It turns out the Canonreeve himself, an honorable man named Valano, has experienced his own doubts about his future under the Dominion. He used to be a good friend to the Queen, even, but worries now the years have changed her.\n"
"\n"
"Valano is a member of a group called the Veiled Heritance. They're a group of freedom fighters, willing to do what has to be done. They're willing to make the hard choices, and stop the spread of foreign influence on our soil. \n"
"\n"
"I was brought up out of that cellar below Silsailen thinking I was going to do hard labor. Instead, I found a new family. Valano said he knew all about my problems, even knew that I'd been taken by a Dominion recruiter. Said that he was willing to help, and help me help myself.\n"
"\n"
"And I will."

"새로운 한 해, 그리고 새로운 시작이다. 지난 밤에 시룬이 나와의 약혼에 동의했다! 나는 마티센에서 가장 운 좋은 머이다. 이미 욘딘과 함께 대장간을 사용할 준비를 마쳤다. 아버지의 낡은 검을 녹여서 마라의 반지를 만들 재료로 사용할 것이다. 마티센의 강철은 병사들을 위해 쓰기엔 너무 좋지 않은가? 내 진실된 마음을 표현하기에는 충분히 좋을 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"새벽 3일:\n"
"포고자들이 섬에 있는 모든 광장에서 소리를 치고 있다. 새로운 여왕님이 오셨다는 것이다! 그리고 이제 우리는 어떤 연합의 일원이라고 한다. 다른 민족들 전부는 아니고, 우드 엘프와 카짓과 함께 말이다. 그들은 그 연합을 \"알드메리 자치령\"이라고 부른다. 나는 이보다 더 자랑스러울 수 없었지만, 아버지는 툴툴거릴 뿐이었다. 아버지는 \"그런 종류의 사람들\"이 섬에 오게 하면 사업이 나빠질 것이라고 말한다.\n"
"\n"
"새벽 10일:\n"
"시룬과 나는 한밤중에 스카이워치로 몰래 숨어들었다. 길가에서 잠을 자려니 정말로 흥미진진했다. 마치 우리가 파이터 길드원이 된 것 같은 느낌이랄까! 섬 전체에 가두 행진에 대한 전단지가 뿌려지고 있었고, 우리는 그런 행사를 그냥 지나칠 수는 없다고 결정했던 것이다. 그 늙은이 머에게 세 배로 저주받을 것이라는 것은 안다. 하지만 아버지는 망할 바보일 뿐이다. 여왕님과 메인, 그리고 보스머 나무종사를 볼 기회를 놓친다니? 내가 살아있는 한 안 되지.\n"
"\n"
"새벽 11일:\n"
"만약 오늘이 어떤 징조의 날이었다면, 아버지가 옳았다. 가두 행진은 굉장했다. 여왕님이 직접 해병대를 이끌고 정문을 통과했다. 그리고는 나무종사들이 능수능란한 정글 유격대원들과 함께 나타났다. 덩굴그늘 유격대라고 누가 그랬던 것 같은데? 그리고는 메인이 나타났는데, 그 땋아 늘인 머리칼이란! 카짓 전사들이 정렬한 모습도 굉장했다.\n"
"\n"
"그 털 덮인 은밀한 도둑놈이 내 동전 주머니를 슬쩍한 것보다는 훨씬 더 즐거웠다. 그놈이 도망치기 전에 붙잡으려 했지만, 도둑은 개구리 경주에 사로잡혀서 주변을 쳐다보지도 않는 그 망할 부두 노동자들 사이로 뛰어들었다. 그리고는 사라져 버렸다. 시룬은 괜찮다고 하면서, 계획보다 더 일찍 떠나면 된다고 말했다. 젠장. 그녀를 실망시키는 것은 정말 싫은데.\n"
"\n"
"새벽 17일:\n"
"전부 다 빌어먹을! 시룬과 내가 스카이워치에서 돌아온 이후로 모든 것이 엉망이다. 아버지는 우리가 떠나서 몹시 화가 났고, 내가 그 고양이에게 얼마나 많은 동전을 털렸는지 말했을 때는... 내가 대장간 일을 배우기 시작했던 이후로 늙다리 녀석이 날 그렇게 때렸던 적은 없었다.\n"
"\n"
"그리고 며칠 전에는 우리 모두 대장간지기의 사무실에 끌려갔었다. 콘달린이 통지하기를, 새로운 연합이 창설되었으니 장인 머들이 \"그 사람들\"을 고용할 수 있다는 것이다. \"그들\"을 어느정도 일자리에 던져 넣으면 탈모어로부터 동전을 추가로 받아낼 수 있다고 했다.\n"
"\n"
"그러더니 아버지와의 계약을 해지해 버렸다! 대장간과 함께 수십 년을 해 왔는데, 이제는 고양이-사람들과 식인종들이 일을 하는 것이다. 이게 다 그 빌어먹을 연합 때문이다. 아버지는 다른 무엇보다도 강철에 미친 사람이다. 그들은 강철을 제대로 다루는 법을 모를 거라고 한다. 하늘의 별들이시여, 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는거지?\n"
"\n"
"첫 번째 파종 2일:\n"
"내 인생은 망했다. 나는 도망치고 있고, 내가 알고 사랑했던 모든 사람들이 날 증오하고 있다. 빌어먹을 \"자치령\"! 우리 미소짓는 여왕도!\n"
"\n"
"전투행정관을 위한 모병관이 마을에 왔을 때 모든 일이 시작되었다. 모병관은 자치령 군대를 위한 자원자들을 찾고 있었다. 아무도 나서는 사람이 없자, 그는 자신에게 강제로 징집할 수 있는 권한이 있다고 말했다. 나와 시룬의 오빠가 걸렸다. 쌍둥이 탈레릴과 타나릴도 붙잡혔다. 우리는 다른 사람들의 패거리 대열에 떠밀려 길 아래로 내려가기 시작했다.\n"
"\n"
"타나릴이 무너지기까지는 1마일이 채 걸리지 않았다. 그는 미쳐 버려선 다크 엘프들과 어떻게 싸우느냐고, 놈들이 우리 시체를 써서 거미 알을 깔 거라고 비명을 질러댔다. 타나릴은 탈주를 시도했고, 우리 중에 많은 무리들도 도망칠 기회를 잡을 수 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"난 실세일렌 근처의 동굴에 숨어있다. 내 아버지는 무일푼 신세다. 내 약혼녀는 곧 나를 배신자라고 생각할 것이다. 그 빌어먹을 고양이들과 발육 불량 엘프들이 섬을 장악하더니, 군대가 아이들을 최선선에 밀어넣고 있다. 이건 내가 자라온 고향 땅이 아니라고!\n"
"\n"
"첫 번째 파종 5일:\n"
"나는 저녁 식사를 위해 뭔가를 훔쳐야 하는 신세로 전락했고, 당연하게도 붙잡혔다. 땅거미가 진 이후에 실세일렌으로 숨어들었었다. 맛있는 흰살 생선 냄새가 산들바람에 퍼져 있었다. 모병관이 마을에 왔었던 그 날 아침에 시룬의 어머니가 만들어주셨던 맛있는 향신료 빵을 먹은 이후로는 괜찮은 음식을 아무것도 먹지 못했었다.\n"
"\n"
"마을에 숨어들어 냄새를 따라 현지의 여관까지 갔었다. 커다랗고 무거운 손이 내 어깨에 올라왔을 때 나는 어떻게 하면 주방에 들어갈 수 있을까 궁리하던 참이었다. 규범행정관의 부하 중 한 명이었다. 마치 내가 마을에 들어왔을 때부터 지켜보고 있었던 것처럼, 내가 뭘 하고 있었는지를 정확하게 알고 있었다. 지금 난 행정관의 저택 지하에 있는 감방에 앉아서 판결을 기다리고 있다. 적어도 저들이 이 일기는 가지고 들어올 수 있게 해 줬다.\n"
"\n"
"망할 아이렌! 망할 자치령!\n"
"\n"
"첫 번째 파종 10일:\n"
"내 옛 삶은 끝났다. 그리고 베일 아래에서 새로운 삶이 시작됐다. 규범행정관 본인이 직접 나타났었다. 발라노라는 이름의 명예로운 남자인 규범행정관은 자치령 아래에서의 미래에 대한 의심을 겪고 있었다. 그는 심지어 여왕의 좋은 친구이기도 했었지만, 지금은 세월이 여왕을 변화시켰다고 걱정하고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"발라노는 베일의 계승단이라고 불리는 조직의 일원이다. 그들은 자유의 전사들이 모인 집단이며, 해야만 하는 일을 하고자 하는 의지를 가지고 있다. 그들은 기꺼이 어려운 선택을 하고자 하며, 우리의 땅에서 외국의 영향력이 퍼져나가는 것을 막고자 한다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 실세일렌 아래의 감방에서 풀려나 고된 노동을 하게 될 것이라고 생각했었다. 그 대신에, 나는 새로운 가족을 찾았다. 발라노는 내 모든 문제를 알고 있다고 말했으며, 심지어는 내가 자치령 모병관에게 끌려갔었다는 사실도 알고 있었다. 그는 날 기꺼이 도와주겠다고, 내 자신을 돕는 것을 도와주겠다고 말했다.\n"

"그리고 난 그렇게 할 것이다."

"\n"
"As a member in high standing, I feel it necessary to explain and extirpate the notion that Kinlord Rilis the XII is somehow a founder of the Mages Guild. The common folk believe that the kinlord, in the days before his cruelty and sadism became well-known, brokered a deal that reigned in \"dangerous mages\" and somehow put binders in place to keep the commonalty safe. This is simply not the case. \n"
" \n"
"Vanus Galerion, student of Iachesis, did indeed flout prevailing thought when it came to magical experimentation in large cities. He drew together numerous students and artificers to the city of Firsthold. For the first time, he sought to prove the benefit of spellcasters working in close proximity. Not for a mighty ritual, but for study, experimentation, and a sense of camaraderie.\n"
" \n"
"This simple premise so terrified the people of Firsthold that they turned to their ruler, Kinlord Rilis the XII. Now known by many less polite titles, Rilis was first and foremost a political animal. He saw in \"Galerion's Folly,\" as it was known at the time, a chance to play the mages and common folk off against each other.\n"
" \n"
"The much-speculated-upon \"Charter Conclave\" brought together Rilis, Iachesis, Galerion, and other notables from across the Isles and the Psijic Order. By common agreement, it is true, no records were kept of that meeting. But mark my words here, adept: Rilis allowed the meeting, allowed Galerion to do what he did, to further his own ends.\n"
" \n"
"In retrospect, of course, the legacy of Artaeum is the proud heritage of the new Mages Guild. We now boldly gather together under the Guild banner, and will no doubt do so for many centuries to come. Just let it be remembered: Rilis the Twelfth was a dangerous mer. Even at the time of the Conclave, he trafficked with dark powers and made pacts with Daedra. \n"

"Loyal citizens of Auridon! I have the pleasure of being an advisor to Her Royal Majesty, Queen Ayrenn the First, Eagle Primarch of the Aldmeri Dominion, High Queen of the Summerset Isles, Overfriend of the Royal Camoran House of the Wood Elven people, and boon companion to the Mane of the Khajiit.\n"
"\n"
"As Royal Advisor, I have penned this brief account of Queen Ayrenn's life and history. Read, that you might welcome our Queen into your hearts.\n"
"\n"
"Her Majesty spent her early days as many children do in the Isles. She trained in blades beside her father. She rode horses in the surf along our golden beaches. And she memorized history and sonnets beneath soft pink petals.\n"
"\n"
"Over twenty years ago, your forward-thinking King—His Royal Majesty, King Hidellith of Alinor, may he be ever honored in Aetherius—gathered with the royal family at the Crystal Tower in celebration of Her Majesty's passage into the Labyrinth. This time of intensive study had been required by all Summerset rulers in the past, and Her Majesty was to step into that period with arms wide. As the hour approached, however, the then-princess was found missing!\n"
"\n"
"While a long search was begun, in truth, Her Majesty had claimed her own destiny. Her Majesty had stolen away to the Isle of Balfiera to live with the Direnni at the Adamant Tower. The members of that clan trained her in the art of war. They turned her simple noble swordplay to lithe and seasoned blade-dancing. Her beachside rides became forced marches on horseback, and her singing of sonnets beneath the trees of her homeland gave way to the study of the arts most arcane.\n"
"\n"
"Much has been made of our Queen's adventures in Tamriel by bards and common broadsheet scribes. Yes, it's true that she once rode a bear. That she hunted the frost trolls of Skyrim, delved into the depths of a Dwarven ruin, and crewed with a pirate captain of Cyrodiil. Her Majesty once flew upon an enormous kite on the winds of the Alik'r Desert, and danced with nereids in the Illessan Hills. These adventures were not the larks of a wanton, but instead a deliberate process. The tempering of a blade!\n"
"\n"
"And when His Majesty King Hidellith passed away, when it looked as though our remote isles would be left to flounder in the swell of history, Princess Ayrenn returned! Her Majesty plucked the crown from where it had fallen in the dust. She took up her father's sword and led us out into the world.\n"
"\n"
"Led us into the world to find new allies waiting just off our shores! The Queen's connections to the noble Wood Elves and fierce Khajiit enabled us to form the mighty Dominion that now stands astride our corner of Tamriel, poised to strike at the dark heart of Cyrodiil and ward off the depredations of the warmongering alliances of the north.\n"
"\n"
"Though she has her detractors and cowards defame her courage from behind a veil, Queen Ayrenn is the living, beating heart of the Dominion. Our fortune and prosperty depend upon her."

"Their ancient history is well known across the Dominion, and not worth recounting in detail here. Suffice to say that the arch-mage known as \"King\" Orgnum has long led the outcasts of the shrouded isle. He uses foul spells, rituals and sacrifices to continually renew his youth and vigor.\n"

"\n"
"By Brother Mikhael Karkuxor of the Imperial College \n"
"\n"
"The Eight\n"
"\n"
"(though few Altmer outside the Empire accept the limitation of Divines to eight):\n"
"\n"
"Auri-El (King of the Aldmer):\n"
"\n"
"The Elven Akatosh is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of Anui-El, who, in turn, is the soul of Anu the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons. Most Altmeri and Bosmeri claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of Lorkhan in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Altmer, Altmora and Old Ehlnofey. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.\n"
"\n"
"Magnus (Magus):\n"
"\n"
"The god of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the last second, though it cost him dearly. What is left of him on the world is felt and controlled by mortals as magic. One story says that, while the idea was thought up by Lorkhan, it was Magnus who created the schematics and diagrams needed to construct the mortal plane. He is sometimes represented by an astrolabe, a telescope, or, more commonly, a staff.\n"
"\n"
"Trinimac:\n"
"\n"
"Strong god of the early Aldmer, in some places more popular than Auri-El. He was a warrior spirit of the original Elven tribes that led armies against the Men. Boethiah is said to have assumed his shape (in some stories, he even eats Trinimac) so that he could convince a throng of Aldmer to listen to him, which led to their eventual Chimeri conversion. Trinimac vanishes from the mythic stage after this, to return as the dread Malacath (Altmeri propaganda portrays this as the dangers of Dunmeri influence).\n"
"\n"
"Y'ffre (God of the Forest):\n"
"\n"
"While Auri-El Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, Y'ffre is revered as the spirit of \"the now.\" According to the Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the Ehlnofey, or \"Earth Bones.\" After these laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it.\n"
"\n"
"Xarxes:\n"
"\n"
"Xarxes is the god of ancestry and secret knowledge. He began as a scribe to Auri-El, and has kept track of all Aldmeri accomplishments, large and small, since the beginning of time. He created his wife, Oghma, from his favorite moments in history.\n"
"\n"
"Mara (Goddess of Love):\n"
"\n"
"Nearly universal goddess. Origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the \"Anuad,\" the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. For the Altmer, she is the wife of Auri-El.\n"
"\n"
"Stendarr (God of Mercy):\n"
"\n"
"God of compassion and righteous rule. In early Altmeri legends, Stendarr is the apologist of Men.\n"
"\n"
"Syrabane (Warlock's God):\n"
"\n"
"An Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic, Syrabane aided Bendu Olo in the Fall of the Sload. Through judicious use of his magical ring, Syrabane saved many from the scourge of the Thrassian Plague. He is also called the Apprentices' God, for he is a favorite of the younger members of the Mages Guild.\n"
"\n"
"— Additional Deities with Significant Altmer Cults —\n"
"\n"
"Phynaster:\n"
"\n"
"Hero-god of the Summerset Isles, who taught the Altmer how to naturally live another hundred years by using a shorter walking stride.\n"
"\n"
"Lorkhan (The Missing God):\n"
"\n"
"This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri \"Lorkhan,\" or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo—much like his father Padomay had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. He and his metaphysical placement in the \"scheme of things\" is interpreted a variety of ways. To the High Elves, he is the most unholy of all higher powers, as he forever broke their connection to the spirit plane. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind."

"\n"
"아우리-엘 (알드머의 왕):\n"
"\n"
"엘프식 아카토쉬가 곧 아우리엘이다. 아우리엘은 아누이엘의 영혼인데, 아누이엘은 곧 만물 그 자체인 아누 (Anu)의 영혼이다. 아우리엘은 알드머 신앙의 주신이다. 알트머와 보스머 대부분은 자신들이 아우리엘의 직계 후손이라고 주장한다. 아우리엘의 유일한 오점은 자신의 일부를 떼어서 필멸자의 차원을 만든 일이었다. 그로 인해 엘프들은 불멸을 보장받을 수 있는 영혼세계로부터 영영 떨어져 나가고 말았던 것이다. 신화 시대, 아우리엘은 자신의 실수를 만회하기 위해서 옛 알드머들을 이끌고 로칸의 군대에 맞섰다. 그리고 폭군 로칸을 물리쳐서 추방한 다음 알트머들의 첫 왕국인 알트모라와 옛 엘노페이를 세웠다. 일을 마친 아우리엘은 자신의 추종자들이 필요할 때 필멸자의 차원에서 탈출하는 법을 배울 수 있도록 그들 모두가 보는 앞에서 승천했다.\n"
"\n"
"마그누스 (마법사):\n"
"\n"
"마법의 신 마그누스는 최후의 순간에 세상의 창조를 그만두었지만, 커다란 대가를 치루었다. 그가 남긴 것은 필멸자들에게 마법으로써 느껴지며 통제된다. 한 이야기에 따르면, 필멸자의 차원을 창조하자는 생각은 로칸에게서 나왔지만, 그 건설에 필요한 도식과 도표를 만든 것은 마그누스라고 한다. 그는 종종 천문 관측 기구, 망원경, 그리고 더 일반적으로는, 지팡이와 함께 표현된다.\n"
"\n"
"트리니막:\n"
"\n"
"초기 알드머의 강력한 신인 그는 어떤 곳에선 아우리엘보다도 더 인기가 있다. 그는 인간에 대항해서 군대를 이끌던 원래 엘프 종족들의 전사 정신을 의미했다. 보에시아가 알드머의 군중들이 자신의 말을 듣도록 납득시키기 위해, 그의 형상을 (어떤 이야기들에선, 그가 심지어 트리니막을 먹었다고도 전해진다.) 상정하였고, 이로써 궁극적으로는 카이머의 개종으로 이끌었다고 전해진다. 그는 이후에 신화의 무대에서 사라지며, 공포의 말라카스로 재등장한다. (알트머는 이것이 던머 영향력의 증가 때문이라고 선전한다.)\n"
"\n"
"이프레 (숲의 신):\n"
"\n"
"시간의 드래곤 아우리엘이 신들의 왕인데 비해, 이프레는 \"바로 지금\"의 영혼으로써 존경받는다. 엘프들에 따르면, 필멸자의 차원이 창조된 후에는 모든 것이 혼돈이었다. 최초의 필멸자들이 식물과 동물로 변했다가 돌아오기를 계속한 것이다. 그러자 이프레는 자기 자신을 최초의 엘노페이, 즉 \"Earth Bones\"로 변화시켰다. 자연의 법칙이 성립된 후, 필멸자들은 새로운 세상에서 안정적인 외관을 얻을 수 있었다. 그들이 드디어 그것을 이해할 수 있게 되었기 때문이다.\n"

"자서스:\n"

"고대의 비밀스러운 지식에 관한 신. 그는 아우리엘에 관하여 기술하고자, 태초부터 모든 알드머의 성과물들을 수집하고 연구했다. 자신의 기억중 가장 마음에 든 시기를 선택하여, 오그마라는 부인을 만들었다.\n"
"\n"
"마라 (사랑의 여신):\n"
"\n"
"거의 모두가 알고 있는 여신이며, 신화 시대에 풍요의 여신으로서 숭배받기 시작했다. 그녀는 이따금 창조를 낳은 우주의 여신인 \"아누아드\"의 니르와 관련되기도 한다. 알트머는 그녀가 아우리엘의 부인이라고 생각한다.\n"
"\n"
"시라바네 (마도사의 신):\n"
"\n"
"마법에 있어 알드머족의 조상신인 시라바네는 슬로드의 몰락 당시에 벤두 올로를 도왔다. 그가 지닌 마법 반지의 신중한 이용을 통하여, 시라바네는 많은 이들을 쓰라시안 역병의 창궐에서 구해내었다. 그는 마법사 길드에서 상대적으로 젊은 구성원들을 아꼈기 때문에, 견습생들의 신으로 불리기도 한다.\n"

"\n"
"로칸 (사라진 신):\n"
"\n"
"이 창조주이자 재주꾼이자 시험자인 신은 모든 탐리엘 신화의 근본이다. 그의 가장 유명한 이름은 알드머 언어로 \"로칸\" 즉 종말의 북이다. 그는 아버지인 파도메이가 시작의 장소인 우주에 불안정성을 유도한 것과 유사하게 근원적 영혼들을 설득 혹은 부추겨서 필멸자의 차원을 만들었다. 세계를 창조한 후 로카즈는 신적인 중심에서 격리되었다. 이는 본의가 아니었다는 설도 있지만 그는 엣'아다의 창조지를 헤메었다. 하이 엘프들에게는, 강력한 신성들 중에서 정신세계와의 연결을 영원히 깨뜨린 그가 가장 부정한 것으로 인식된다. 그와 그의 \"계획\"의 추상적 설계에 대해서는 문화에 따라 해석이 갈린다. 전설 속에서 그는 거의 언제나 알드머의 적이자 초기 인류의 영웅으로 묘사된다."

The Bretons are also so indiscriminate that they have accepted the bestial Orsimer as allies. (Orsimer! Can you imagine?) Though capable of mustering substantial brute force, there is no evidence that these degraded hybrids have the wisdom or learning to deal with the mystical disaster now threatening the Mundus.

"By Phrastus of Elinhir\n"
"\n"
"The reasons why the Daedra are reviled and their worship forbidden among all the civilized races of Tamriel are well understood, and as this series of papers will show, are grounded in historical events. The opinions of the so-called academic who styles herself \"Lady Cinnabar\" notwithstanding, the evidence supporting my assertions is incontrovertible and generally accepted by all accredited scholars of antiquity.\n"
"\n"
"The Aldmeri, who'd been first to begin organized worship of the Aedra, were also the first to venerate the Daedra Lords. This probably began on a small scale among the Ayleids, those Elves who left the Summerset Isles to create splinter cultures in central and southwest Tamriel—in some cases specifically to evade the strictures of Aldmeri regulation, which forbade (among many other things) the worship of Daedra. \n"
"\n"
"As Ayleid culture flourished, drawing ever further from Alinor, in the last millennium of the Merethic Era Daedric worship took hold and spread among the Heartland High Elves. The Aedra were still widely revered, with probably a majority of the Ayleids continuing to pay them homage, but cults devoted to the various Daedric Princes sprang up across Cyrodiil, tolerated and then celebrated. Unlike the Chimer, the Ayleids made no distinction between \"good and bad\" Daedra—indeed, even some of the more heinous Princes received mass veneration, especially when their worship was adopted and endorsed by Ayleid kings and aristocrats. \n"
"\n"
"Widespread Daedra worship among the Heartland Elves was particularly ill news for the tribes of Nedic humans who were then arriving in Tamriel. The Ayleids enslaved the immigrant tribes of Men, at first occasionally but then systematically, and the Nedic people found themselves subject to masters who, in many cases, worshiped the Princes—including those who encouraged slavery, domination, and cruelty. Under the Ayleids, the human thralls found themselves the subjects of such Daedra-inspired \"arts\" as flesh-sculpture and gut-gardening. In fact, the revulsion for Daedra-worship that pervades most human cultures in Tamriel probably originated in this period.\n"
"\n"
"The Alessian slave-revolt of the early First Era was largely fueled by desperate rage against the Ayleids' Daedra-inspired cruelty. The Ayleid kings who aligned themselves with the rebellion were largely Aedra-worshipers, which in part explains why, once the Ayleids were overthrown, Queen Alessia incorporated the leading Elven Aedra into the First Empire's worship of the Eight Divines. Her new Empire of Cyrodiil outlawed the worship of the Daedric Princes, and Daedra-worshiping Ayleids were exterminated wherever they were found.\n"
"\n"
"Thus, by the middle of the First Era, large-scale Daedra-worship was extinct in central Tamriel, surviving only among the Chimer in the northeast of the continent, and among the Orcs (ever a pariah people) who worshiped Malacath (or Mauloch) as their god-ancestor. Elsewhere, among Men, Mer, and Beast-Peoples, Daedra-worship survived only at the level of cults which were more-or-less forbidden. Lady Cinnabar's assertions to the contrary are so much horsewash."

"\n"
"By Sathyr Longleat\n"
"\n"
"Bravil is one of the most charming towns in Cyrodiil, sparkling in her simple beauty, illustrious by her past. No visit to the southern part of the Imperial Province is complete without a walk along Bravil's exciting river port, a talk with her friendly native children, and, of course, in the tradition of the village, a whispered word to the famous statue of the Lucky Old Lady.\n"
"\n"
"Many thousands of years before the arrival of the Atmorans, the native Ayleid people had long lived in the vicinity of modern day Bravil. The Niben then, as now, provided food and transportation, and the village was even more populous than it is today. We are not certain what they called their region: as insular as they were, the word they used would be translated to simply mean \"home.\" These savage Ayleids were so firmly entrenched that the Bravil region was one of the very last areas to be liberated by the Alessian army in the second century of the First Era. Though little remains of that era culturally or archeologically, thank Mara, the tales of debauchery and depravity have entered into the realm of legends.\n"
"\n"
"How the Ayleids were able to survive such a long siege is debated by scholars to this day. All, however, grant the honor of the victory to one of the Empress Alessia's centurions, a man called Teo Bravillius Tasus, the man for whom the modern town is named.\n"
"\n"
"It was said he invaded the village no less than four times, after heavy resistance, but each time upon the morning dawning, all his soldiery within would be dead, murdered. By the time more centuria had arrived, the fortified town was repopulated with Ayleids. After the second successful invasion, secret underground tunnels were found and filled in, but once again, come morning, the soldiers were again dead, and the citizens had returned. After the third successful siege, legions were posted outside of the town, watching the roads and riverway for signs of attacks, but no one came. The next morning, the bodies of the invading soldiers were thrown from the parapets of town's walls.\n"
"\n"
"Teo Bravillius Tasus knew that the Ayleids must be hiding themselves somewhere in the town, waiting until nightfall, and then murdering the soldiers while they slept. The question was where. After the fourth invasion, he himself led the soldiers in a thorough inspection of every corner, every shadow. Just as they were ready to give up, the great centurion noticed two curious things. High in the sheer walls of the town, beyond anyone's ability to climb, there were indentations, narrow platforms. And by the river just inside the town, he discovered a single footprint from someone clearly not wearing the Imperial boot.\n"
"\n"
"The Ayleids, it seemed, had taken two routes to hide themselves. Some had levitated up to the walls and hidden themselves high above, and others had slipped into the river, where they were able to breathe underwater. It was a relatively easy task once the strange Elves' even stranger hiding holes had been discovered to rout them out, and see to it that there were no more midnight assassinations of the Empress's troops.\n"

"It may seem beyond belief that an entire community could be so skilled in these spells hundreds and hundreds of years before the Mages Guild was formed to teach the ways of magicka to the common folk. There does, however, appear to be evidence that, just as the Psijics on the Isle of Artaeum developed Mysticism long before there was a name for it, the even more obscure Ayleids of southern Cyrodiil had developed what was to be known as the School of Alteration. It is not, after all, much of a stretch when one considers that other Ayleids at the time of Bravil's conquering and even later were shapeshifters. The community of pre-Bravil could not turn into beasts and monsters, but they could alter their bodies to hide themselves away. A related and useful skill, to be sure. But not so effective to save themselves in the end."

"브라빌 (Bravil)은 자체의 아름다움으로 빛나지만 과거 역사로도 유명하며, 시로딜에서 가장 멋진 마을들 중 하나이다. 브라빌의 활기찬 하항을 걷거나 해맑은 브라빌 아이들과 대화하지 않고는 임페리얼 지역의 남쪽 지방은 방문했다고도 할 수 없다. 물론 그 유명한 행운의 노파상에 속삭이는 것도 빼놓을 수 없다.\n"
"\n"
"아트모라인들이 도착하기 수천 년도 전에, 에일리드 원주민들이 현대 브라빌의 부근에 오랫동안 거주해 왔다. 니벤  강이 오늘날과 같이 운송과 식량을 제공해 주었고, 마을은 심지어 오늘날의 브라빌보다 더 유명했다. 그들이 정확히 그 지역을 무엇이라 불렀는지는 확실하지 않다. 그들 언어의 폭이 좁으므로, 그들이 사용한 단어는 아마 단순히 \"집\"을 의미했을 것이다. 잔혹한 에일리드들이 너무나 확고하게 브라빌에 자리를 잡고 있었기 때문에 이 지역은 첫 번째 시대 2세기에 알레시아 해방군에 대항하여 마지막까지 남아있던 지역중 하나였다. 그 시대에 대한 것은 문화적으로나 고고학적으로나 남은 것이 거의 없지만, 마라께 감사하게도, 방탕과 부패에 대해 전해지는 이야기는 가히 전설적이다.\n"
"\n"
"에일리드인들이 어떻게 그렇게 오랜 포위에서 살아남을 수 있었는지는 지금까지도 학자들 사이에서 논쟁거리가 되고 있다. 하지만 모든 승리의 공적은 오늘날 마을의 이름을 딴, 알레시아 (Alessia)군의 백인대장 중 한명인 테오 브라빌리우스 타수스 (Teo Bravillius Tasus)에게 돌아간다.\n"
"\n"
"그는 거센 저항을 이겨내고 그 마을을 무려 네 번이나 침략했다고 하는데, 매번 아침 해가 뜨기 전까지 마을 안의 그의 모든 병사들이 살해되었다. 병력이 새로 도착할 때 즈음에는, 강화된 마을 안에 다시 에일리드인들이 살고 있었다. 두 번째 침공이 성공한 뒤에 비밀 지하 터널을 발견하여 모두 메웠으나, 또다시 아침이 오자 병사들은 모두 죽어있었으며 주민들은 돌아왔다. 세 번째 침공이 성공한 후에 제국군은 공격의 조짐이 있는지 마을 바깥을 감시하고, 길과 강가를 순찰했다. 그러나 아무도 오지 않았다. 다음날 아침, 침략한 병사들의 시체가 마을의 난간벽에서 떨어져 내렸다.\n"
"\n"
"테오 브라빌리우스 타수스는 에일리드인들이 마을 어딘가에 숨어서 밤까지 기다린 뒤, 잠자는 병사들을 살해한다는 것을 알게 되었다. 문제는 어디에 숨었느냐 하는 것이었다. 네 번째 침공 후 그는 직접 병사를 이끌고 모든 귀퉁이, 모든 그림자를 순시했다. 막 포기하려던 참에, 위대한 백인대장은 두 가지 이상한 점을 발견했다. 마을의 벽 높은 곳, 누군가 올라갈 수도 없을 것 같은 자리에 패인 자리와 단이 있었다. 그리고 마을 안의 강가에서, 그는 제국군의 군화를 신지 않았음이 분명한 누군가의 발자국을 발견했다.\n"
"\n"
"에일리드는 몸을 숨기기 위해 두 가지 방법을 사용한 것으로 생각된다. 어떤 이들은 몸을 숨길 수 있을 만큼 충분한 높이로 공중 부양했고, 물속에서 숨 쉴 수 있는 자들은 강을 통해 빠져나갔다. 이상한 엘프들의 훨씬 더 이상한 탈출로가 발견된 뒤에 그들을 궤멸시키는 것은 상대적으로 훨씬 쉬운 일이었으며, 이후 제국군 병사들이 한밤중에 암살당하는 일은 없어졌다.\n"
"\n"
"일반인에게 매지카의 사용을 가르쳐주기 위해 마법사 길드가 형성되기도 훨씬 전에 마을 구성원 전부가 그러한 마법사용에 통달했다는 것은 믿기 어려울 지도 모른다. 그러나 명확한 것은, 아르테움섬의 시직들이 그들의 이름이 지어지기 전부터 신비마법을 발전시켰다는 것이며, 시로딜 남부의 에일리드인들이 변화마법을 발전시켰음은 더욱 확실하다. 따라서 브라빌 정복 당시 에일리드들이 둔갑을 했다거나 하는 이야기는 과장이다. 브라빌의 이전 주민들은 동물이나 몬스터로 변신할 수는 없었지만, 그들의 몸을 변화시켜 숨을 수는 있었다. 물론 아주 유용한 기술이긴 하나 결국은 그들을 지켜주지 못했다."

"With the Circle of Captains' decree that each ship's crew should go forth of its own accord, making its own legend, the crew of the Fallowfire rejoiced. They yearned to bring the fear of Men to new lands of the Mer that had not yet been put to the sword. They took to heart their Lord Ysgramor's words to \"Give no quarter. Show no kindness.\"\n"
"\n"
"A pyre upon the shore was raised for the Fallowfire. The ashes of their beloved vessel fell upon the waters and drifted toward Atmora, cutting all ties with their homeland. Led by Captain Gurilda Sharktooth, the crew of the Fallowfire turned their backs to the sea and strode inland.\n"
"\n"
"South they traveled, seeking lands untrammeled by others of Ysgramor's crews. South and south they went, sowing the blood vengeance demanded by Ysgramor. No Mer escaped their axes once seen, no settlement remained unburnt in their path. Truly the Fallowfires brought their lord's wrath to bear upon the treacherous Elves. As they journeyed, so the terror of them grew among the Mer.\n"
"\n"
"Gurilda led her crew to the foothills of a lofty range of mountains. These they named Ysgramor's Teeth and long they sought a pass through them. When finally a way was found, the crew crossed over and into a new land. \"The Rift\" they called this region, for it was riven by deep canyons and swift-flowing rivers. In the name of Fallowfire, their lost Companions, and Yngol, they scoured the land, burning Mer villages and putting all they encountered to the axe.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, the Mer offered battle. The cowardly Elves gathered in great numbers high atop a rocky hill, daring Gurilda's Companions to attack. And so they did. Challenges were offered, brave deeds were done, and heroes made. Battle raged through the day and as the sun touched the peaks of the western mountains, the Mer broke and fled. Gurilda lay dying, pierced by a multitude of weapons, but lived until sunset. Her spirit ascended to Sovngarde knowing her crew was victorious.\n"
"\n"
"That day, the dominion of Elves over the Rift was ended. The Companions claimed the land in the name of Ysgramor, Harbinger of us all, and made it free to all Nords. To honor their dead, the Companions labored long, delving into the hillside to craft a tomb. Gurilda was buried there, with all her weapons and armor. There too were placed the remains of Bergitte the Toothless and Kajord Eagle-Eye, laid alongside Gurilda as they had fallen in battle, defending their captain. Others of the honored dead were entombed as well. A mighty cairn of stone was erected around the tomb entrance, to forever mark the grave.\n"
"\n"
"Vikord One-Ear, long Gurilda's first mate but now captain, gazed long upon the hills rising about them and the valleys at their feet. This was a land he could love, where his people could prosper and grow. He decreed the crew's wandering at an end and caused a great hall to be built on the battle site. Thus was Fallowstone Hall created, in homage to the ship that carried them to these shores. From this time, the days of the Companions of the Rift are counted. Never may their glory fade!"

"At last Sinmur was brought to bay. Ysgramor, Harbinger of us all, boldly led the remaining Companions into the final battle. Many a brave Companion had already fallen to the giants. Stalwart Valdur and Sly Hakra, long may their spirits be honored, fell assaulting the wily half-giant. Many others now trod the blessed pathways to Sovngarde. With all his kin slain, only Sinmur still defied the greatest among us.\n"
"\n"
"The axe Wuuthrad, dripping with the gore of a hundred dead giants, gleamed in the darkness of Sinmur's barrow. Ysgramor strode forward, halting his followers with a gesture. With another he dared Sinmur to face him in mortal combat. The giant-kin proved willing, roaring his defiance and leaping to battle. His massive, iron-bound club swung forward to crush. Our Lord Ysgramor stepped aside and the club shattered the stone a pace from his side. Wuuthrad sang a blood song as it chopped into the club, breaking it asunder as if made from straw.\n"
"\n"
"Sinmur howled his rage and hurled the stub of his once-fearsome weapon at Our Lord Ysgramor's head. He grappled Ysgramor, seeking to squeeze life away. A roar of laughter was the answer the monster received. Ysgramor's forehead and knee delivered two mighty blows. Sinmur screeched and fell to his knees before our lord.\n"
"\n"
"A song of death and delight keened from Wuuthrad as Ysgramor buried it deep in the giant-kin's skull. A splatter of gore and a death rattle came from Sinmur as Ysgramor gave a victory yell. The Companions cheered mightily as Wuuthrad waved overhead. The depredations of the giant and his vile kin were at last ended. And the legend of Ysgramor, Harbinger of us all, grew mightily that day."

"There's a reason I was kicked out of Daggerfall, chased out of Elden Root, and banned from Mournhold. I've tried every variety of intoxicant, wine, ale, and Argonian swill this world has to offer. I've sampled skooma with Khajiit, licked an Argonian Hist Tree, and hunted \"magical\" toads with the Bosmer.\n"
"\n"
"None of that compares to Nord mead. There's nothing like it.\n"
"\n"
"The purest stuff is made in Nord villages, but we're at war with the Nords, and a Breton has no guarantee of surviving a trip like that. Leave that sort of thing to the professionals. There is still hope, however. If you're ever at a tavern, and there's a cask of Nord mead, you'd be a fool to pass it up.\n"
"\n"
"Mead is made by fermenting honey and water (though a few recipes call for molasses). Sometimes, you add grain mash and strain it, but that isn't necessary. Some of the High Elves call it \"honey wine,\" but mead needs more than good honey. Every meadery has its own recipes. After you drink enough mead, you learn the names of the brewmasters who create them. A drunk Nord will gladly punch another in the face over the honor of a good brewmaster. Then again, a drunk Nord will punch anyone for just about anything.\n"
"\n"
"Every brewmaster has a distinct blend of spices, fruit, and sometimes hops (which makes a mead bitter, which makes some Nords bitter, too). I've even heard tales of mead mixed with the blood of heroes, allegedly granting them the words of a poet or skald. I'd like a mead named after me, but I'm not going to bleed for it.\n"
"\n"
"An Altmer once told me that brewing is the basis of all culture. It's why our ancestors started farming and forming cities. It's what we do when we've got too much wheat and barley and hops and we're sick of farming. The culture of drinking seems to be what keeps Nords together.\n"
"\n"
"Nords must be really sick of farming, because they brew and drink prodigious amounts of mead. Whenever a cask of really good mead is opened, Nords gather round because they know that cask won't last long. But if you don't know how to behave in the Nord drinking culture, you'll end up broke, broken, hungover, and helpless. I found out the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Nords love to drink. But more than that. Nords respect those who can endure adversity. I know that sounds flowery for explaining why two drunk Nords would have a \"hit-me-hard-in-the-face\" contest, but really, that's why their culture celebrates getting drunk.\n"
"\n"
"A Nord can gain respect by consuming more mead than anyone else, just as he's respected for surviving a blizzard or killing a bear with a sharp stick. \"Nord honor\" is something they talk about endlessly when they're drunk, and even more when they're sober. So the first thing you learn about Nords is if you want their respect, never turn down a drink. It's a test. If you can't handle that next drink, leave. Otherwise you'll wake up somewhere they find hilarious, but you won't be laughing.\n"
"\n"
"Nords also love their skalds. Songs and stories go over well with a drunk audience, once they've had enough of brawling, boasting, and throwing axes at each other. Their songs are all about how they're better than everyone else at everything. They've all heard these over and over again, so bring some of your own. They're desperate to hear something new.\n"
"\n"
"Anywhere you go, drinking is also a good way to redress a mistake or make an apology, and it's the same with Nords. If you lose a contest, you need to buy a drink. If you make a mistake or offend someone, you need to buy a drink. If you're insulted, stand there and take it, then you need to buy a drink.\n"
"\n"
"You don't have to be the best brawler around to survive a room full of drunken Nords. You can also impress them by being clever or by being talented, but you better be really good. When it's time to take a punch in the face, you better be ready for a punch in the face. If you don't like getting punched, there are some things you should never talk about, like politics, who's the best brewmaster, and who punches the hardest. And never demand to know why someone just punched you in the face.\n"
"\n"
"If you want to hear more, buy me a drink the next time I'm in Daggerfall. I'll tell you a story."

"When I was a lad, I stood at the eastern edge of Skyrim and looked upon Morrowind. From Stendarr's Beacon, I could see the Red Mountain of Vvardenfell, but I never ventured there. Like many Nords, I was content to leave foreign lands to the foreigners.\n"
"\n"
"A scant ten years ago in 2E 572, my father took a different path. He fought with our Dunmeri allies to repel the Second Akaviri invasion. As a soldier of Skyrim, he was there when the Nords pursued the invaders into Stonefalls. He told me of an army on the brink of ruin, marching ever further into foreign territory, hungry and nearly broken, until the Dunmer brought in Argonian troops to aid the Nords.\n"
"\n"
"No one expected this. I still cannot believe it. The Dunmer once held the Argonians as slaves, yet on that day, the Argonians' arrival changed the course of history. From the jungles they came, adorned with blood and mud. Akaviri fell beneath their claws, as well as the swords and spells of their Nord and Dunmeri allies. An alliance was forged that day and has never faltered since.\n"
"\n"
"Agreements were signed in Ebonheart, but these were formalities compared to the ties made on the battlefield. Our alliance was forged in the fires of adversity, a shield to protect us from all invaders. Our cultures differ, but our aims bind us.\n"
"\n"
"A few years ago, the Dunmeri Tribunal called for more troops from our alliance, insisting that we take up arms against a new enemy: an Empire growing in Cyrodiil. Our enemies in the Covenant and Dominion  also sent troops to liberate this territory.\n"
"\n"
"And now? War rages across Tamriel. Khajiit and Bosmer war against Dunmer and Argonians. Altmer strike against Skyrim. And from High Rock, the Daggerfall Covenant attacks us all.\n"
"\n"
"In the midst of such chaos, what choice do we have? Our alliance with the Dunmer and Argonians has stood for a decade. I have fought beside our allies in battle. And when I return home, I tell my children proud tales of victory over our foes, fighting with Dunmer and Argonians beside me.\n"
"\n"
"The Pact never ceases to surprise me. I have spoken at great length with Argonian mystics, marveling at their view of the world. I have walked into the caves of Dunmeri priests, staring at shadows as they tell me tales of their gods.\n"
"\n"
"And someday, we will walk together into the heart of Cyrodiil—Dunmer, Argonians, and Nords. We will triumph under the banner of our Pact, steadfast allies who can never be defeated."

"Loremasters hear tales of heroes who claim to have traveled to Sovngarde and back, but their truth is uncertain. The greatest warriors stride the road to Sovngarde upon their deaths, but if the living can walk there and return, it has not yet been shown.\n"
"\n"
"Yet loremasters know this: Sovngarde exists. So our gods promise, so we believe. Sovngarde lies in the heart of Aetherius, awaiting the souls of departed warriors. Nords who prove themselves in battle awaken in the realm after death. Pain and illness vanish within the Hall of Valor. Revelry is never-ending, mead flows freely, and the greatest Nords of all time compete in tests of strength and prowess. \n"
"\n"
"Spirits trapped in this world know torment, emptiness, and endless suffering, obsessing over lost battles, fallen kingdoms, and unresolved lives. Not so in Sovngarde! Even the tedium of immortality is unknown, for spectral foes wait in the surrounding shadows, waiting to do battle with those who would test their mettle.\n"

For all we know, Shor retreated to that realm and laughs at all who would outwit him. He may even rule the realm, choosing heroes to honor according to his whims.\n"

"All this is speculation. Only those who are worthy know the truth, and they speak no more to the living. Through all the suffering and adversity in this world, true Nord warriors endure, for Sovngarde awaits."

"It came to pass that our great lord Ysgramor, the Harbinger of us all, sat before an encampment fire. The crews of the Jorrvaskr, the Fallowfire, and the Kaal Kaaz bade him eat, and boast, and drink. For the boon members of the Five Hundred Companions were abroad in the land. Stories were told, hearts won and lost, and always the smell of roasting meat hung in the air. The greatest of us all beckoned every warrior to his side, and spoke the tale of Wuuthrad's forging.\n"
"\n"
"Every Mer the Harbinger slew died at Wuuthrad's bite. All through the long campaign, the only weapon that would fit in the Harbinger's hand was the mighty Wuuthrad. As he told it, the most legendary of axes was forged in the darkest of nights.\n"
"\n"
"It was the Night of Tears. Ysgramor sat staring out across the waters. He rode upon the last ship in his fleet, fleeing Tamriel for the shores of Atmora. From that vantage point, he watched as Saarthal—the first city—burned. A swollen sky poured rain upon the flames and upon the sea. And the greatest of us all wept bitter tears.\n"
"\n"
"So great was the grief of the Harbinger that, instead of salty sorrow, Ysgramor wept tears of purest ebony. His eldest, Yngol, collected the tears in a stein and held his father in a warm embrace. He poured mead down the Harbinger's great throat, wrapped furs around the Harbinger's great shoulders, and slung the Harbinger into a great hammock below decks.\n"
"\n"
"Then he set to work. For Yngol, eldest son to the Harbinger of us all, was the greatest smith our people have ever known. There, on the sea, Yngol set to work with his tools. He used lightning to heat the Night's Tears, the ocean's swell to cool them, and always his hammer-blows rang in concert with the rising wind.\n"
"\n"
"When Ysgramor awoke the next morning, Yngol presented him with a mighty axe, hewn from the sorrow that had laid him low just the night before. And the Harbinger of us all embraced his son. He cried out in joy, sadness, and rage. And there on the deck of the last ship from Saarthal, Ysgramor named his axe Wuuthrad, which means \"Storm's Tears\" in the language of Atmora. \n"
"\n"
"It was then, in telling the tale, that Ysgramor paused. The Harbinger of us all called out to lost Yngol, who had been with the crew of the Harakk in the Storm of Seperation. For his son, his eldest and greatest joy, was with him always. He who had bound the storm's tears, he said, rode with him always in the days of the noble and honored Five Hundred."

"이스그래머가 그 다음날 아침 일어났을때, 잉골은 그에게 어젯밤 그를 몸져눕게 만든 슬픔으로 벼려낸 위대한 도끼를 선물했다. 그리고 이스그래머는 그의 아들을 껴안았다. 그는 기쁨, 슬픔, 분노로 울부짖었다. 그리고 사아쌀에서 나온 마지막 배 위에서, 이스그래머는 그의 도끼를 우쓰라드, 아트모라의 언어로는 \"폭풍의 눈물\"이라는 뜻의 이름을 지었다.\n"

"Day 29: It was revealed today that the host can reject the vessel if not carefully prepared in the specific manner in which we have been instructed. This is a grave affront to the host and not something that will be taken lightly should your work on the vessel be sloppy enough to cause this.\n"
"\n"
"Day 31: There are two recent shortcut practices which have been found to cause unreliable lifespans for the vessels. It is important to not take any shortcuts during preparation. Those responsible for the propagation of the false knowledge have been dealt with.\n"
"\n"
"Day 37: The first shining example of our future has been created. The host and vessel are joined perfectly and the resulting power is breathtaking."

"The town of Riften offers intriguing opportunities for the enterprising rogue, though hidden quicksands lurk as well. The Rift has little fertile ground for our endeavors and Riften is the only locale I can recommend for even a brief visit.\n"
"\n"
"Once in town, a base of operations can be established at the Withered Tree or Shadehome Inn; both cater to the discerning traveler. A casual perusal of the town will yield several prospects, but I erect the spine of warning. All scouting must be circumspect, with purchase of an item from one of the town's many merchants. For the town guard are active and unusually suspicious of strangers, especially those not of the Nord race. A meandering walk, without a local purchase in hand, will quickly land one in a cell.\n"
"\n"
"The island that forms the heart of town, surrounded by the invigorating waters of the nearby lake, contains several merchant stalls. A quick purchase there will soothe the guards' suspicions. And it affords a glance at the merchants' goods. These vary greatly in quality and selection, so the stalls of greatest interest I leave to each to determine for himself.\n"
"\n"
"To the north are two buildings of note. Two merchant families of long standing sell wares not generally available in the island stalls. The Rothalens sell crafting materials, including a few very specialized and rare items. This Dunmer family is tolerated in Riften for the glamor their wares add to the otherwise mundane town. The Rothalens, like all Dunmer, are grasping and suspicious, employing an unfortunate number of guards and more-esoteric security measures. The claw of greed should be tempered with the hiss of caution here.\n"
"\n"
"Next to the Rothalens is the establishment of Guram Ironarm. This retired blacksmith and his family cater to the weaponsmithing and armorer crafts. Virtually all materials needed for these endeavors can be found here, making this shop a destination for crafters from across the Rift. Security here is handled by the Ironarm clan, and a dozen severed hands nailed above the entrance attest to the family zeal.\n"
"\n"
"On the Guard Captain's quarters and the Fighters Guild we need not dwell, for only the foolish dive into waters so deep and swift-running with no reward in sight.\n"
"\n"
"Ah, but the Mages Guildhall, the most impressive edifice in Riften! My claws quiver in remembrance of the treasures contained therein. Spell components, rare scrolls, and powerful magical items—a trove unique in the Rift. Alas, the safeguards upon them are both subtle and deadly. Venture into this building with all senses alert.\n"
"\n"
"Along the water's edge are the town's docks. While the simple-minded fish from them or gaze into the murky waters, for the acquisitive among us they hold greater delights. Merchants who prefer the shadows can be found along the lower level of the docks, conducting business in the delightfully damp warehouses at the waterline. A purchaser for goods of any sort can usually be found here. The town guard avoids the underdocks or patrols only in large, easily avoided groups.\n"
"\n"
"A grating at one end of the docks leads into a small sewer system. Now used only as a rat pathway, perhaps as Riften grows this will eventually be extended underneath the entire town, rendering it more useful for clandestine operations.\n"
"\n"
"In the hopes that I may contribute to the expansion of our guild's knowledge, I offer this record of my experiences in the town of Riften. Stay moist, comrades. \n"

"\n"
"If one has the opportunity—or misfortune—to deal with the wild clansmen of the Reach, you should know who you're dealing with. There are a number of clans who trade calmly and peaceably with the cities of the North. Then, there are those who view travelers as threats. Or as targets. \n"
"\n"
"In my studies, I've identified three clans in particular that should be avoided at all costs.\n"
"\n"
"Boneshaper Clan:\n"
"\n"
"The Boneshapers have developed an unusual number of rituals involving thorny vines and plants. The clan's name stems from their tradition of lacing or growing these vines through the skeletons of their ritual sacrifices. This plant does not appear to be native to the Reach, but they cultivate it well.\n"
"\n"
"When going on a raid or into battle they use these vines to create effigies, shaping the plants into rough mockeries of life. Some of these rituals also make use of the dead, though necromancy appears to be forbidden in the clan. It's unclear how these bodies are used, but travelers who see their crude clan symbol should stay well clear.\n"
"\n"
"Rageclaw Clan:\n"
"\n"
"The Rageclaws have domesticated a breed of stout, battle-ready ursines. These bears are trained from an early age, bound to a specific clansman or clan family. A matriarchal society, this clan imitates their animal companions in many ways. The protection of young clan members is paramount, and I've seen whole Rageclaw families go into battle over the slightest threat to their children.\n"
"\n"
"A particular habit of the clan causes them friction with other Reach clans: Rageclaws are known to overtake and absorb other smaller clans, converting them to the way of the claw. Women new to the clan find they have tremendous control and freedom, and often enjoy the transition. Male warriors are pitted against grown bears in one-on-one combat, earning a place in the clan by forcing an ursine to submit. It usually goes poorly for clansmen unfamiliar with these massive beasts.\n"
"\n"
"Stonetalon Clan: \n"
"\n"
"Finally the Stonetalon clan, while not as outwardly aggressive as the other two clans above, exhibit a number of particular and combative behaviors. As with the Rageclaws, Stonetalon clans are matriarchies. However, women of the tribe seem to be rare. When they're seen, their women seem to be covered in heavy cloaks made of bird feathers, as if they've all taken ill. I believe they're struggling through a series of trials for an unknown purpose. \n"
"\n"
"In any case, every cloaked female I've encountered has been a powerful spellcaster. Stonetalon clans, as a result, may be the most dangerous groups to meet far afield."

"By Cyrillo the Deranged\n"
"\n"
"They call me mad and have branded me insane. I accept the title they have given me, and wear it proudly as a badge of honor. For the name I now carry shows that I was willing to enter the dark places, over and over again. To brave the ruins of madness and chaos to bring knowledge to the world. The Three protect me from the things I have discovered, and keep my mind clear long enough to share this knowledge with the world!\n"
"\n"
"I found my first Daedric ruin when I was a very young man. It was a hidden shrine from the past, dedicated to the Anticipations of the Tribunal. I was rounding up a number of kwama scribs that had wandered away from the herd. I followed the scribs into a hidden canyon, when I heard the pathetic cry of a lost scrib emerging from a crack in the canyon wall. I squeezed through the narrow gap to find that it opened into a large depression in the rock. But no simple cave had I wandered into. No, this space was full of carved stone that at once filled me with both wonder and deep fear. For the oppressive blocks of set stone were decorated with patterns of webbing and spider motifs, and the statue at the center of the space depicted none other than the Anticipation of Vivec, the Webspinner Mephala.\n"
"\n"
"Words carved into the base of the statue burned into my memory, never to be forgotten: \"Lust is love. Lies are truth. Death is life.\" They frightened me, but also excited me. The experience set me on a path that led to madness and knowledge, though where one ends and the other begins, I cannot tell.\n"
"\n"
"I returned to my family's kwama mine, escorting the scribs back to the herd. Then I packed a bag, said goodbye to my mother, and started my search for the hidden shrines and dark places where the Daedric ruins wait to be discovered.\n"
"\n"
"Not every ruined shrine waits beneath the ground. Some hide in open places that are far from inhabited lands. These might be overgrown with vegetation or lost within the folds of rolling hills and craggy canyons. I have even visited a shrine that was hidden beneath the sea.\n"
"\n"
"Those shrines located in underground caves and complexes tend to appear more ominous and oppressive than those happened upon in the great outdoors, but that could just be the influence of the ever-present darkness and awareness of the crushing walls of stone. Some of these ancient shrines stand alone in the darkness, but others serve as the focal points of great complexes, many of which are guarded by elaborate traps or vicious monsters—or both.\n"
"\n"
"I have visited more than a dozen of these Daedric ruins, and a few were not as abandoned and unused as the Temple would have you believe. There are still those among us who honor and even worship the Daedric Princes, and I discovered more than a few fresh offerings and sacrifices in these dark places. But the true secret, the knowledge that has earned me my new name? For that, I must ask you to keep an open mind and a firm resolve, because what I am about to reveal may sound unbelievable. It may even sound like the beginning of a campfire story, one intended to frighten before bedtime. But I assure you, this is no story.\n"
"\n"
"What did I find at that first shrine to the Webspinner that I wandered into by luck and accident? What drove me from my parents' home in search of other Daedric ruins? It was the voice. Beautiful and seductive. It whispered to me, told me secrets that I never should have heard. The whispers emanated from the ancient, cracked statue. They echoed from the cavern walls. They reverberated through my mind, building in volume and intensity until they drowned out my own thoughts and memories. They frightened me, these whispers. But they also excited me, and I had to hear more. But the Webspinner was done with me. She imparted her words of wisdom and dark secrets and fell silent. The place was once more abandoned, desolate.\n"
"\n"
"If I wanted to hear more—and I so very much wanted to hear more—I would have to find another shrine. And so my life's work was set before me. I had to find other secret places, other hidden ruins. I had to hear what the other Daedra had to say. Not because I worship them. Not because I had fallen under some dark spell. No, I needed to learn more so that I could share it with the world. It was imperative! It was my duty! But, as I write these words, I find that I can't reveal what the whispers told me. My hand won't put the whispers to paper. It refuses no matter how hard I try!\n"
"\n"
"It seems I have failed in my mission. All I can do is tell you that there are secrets to learn. But it appears that if you want to learn them, you'll have to make the trip yourself. Visit the dark ruins, listen to the whispers. Perhaps you'll fare better than I, and the whispers won't drive you mad."

"From the Journal of Mjahlar Virian\n"
"\n"
"For as long as I can remember, my life has been devoted to one thing: taking the lives of others. These were not random killings. Only those who fell afoul of the law, who wronged the Houses of Morrowind, or who desecrated the sacred teachings of the Tribunal were fair game.\n"
"\n"
"Their lives were mine to take. Given to me, you might say, because they deserved to die. And I was very good at killing.\n"
"\n"
"My victims were mostly unaware that I was coming for them. Some knew they had wronged others: murdered an innocent, stole from the Houses, even bedded another's lover. But they would always claim they had done nothing wrong. That I was mistaken. That I had the wrong man or woman. With a blade at a throat, however, it's amazing how honestly and completely one makes a confession.\n"
"\n"
"One after another, I ended them. A swift slice across the throat. The shallow flesh parted, the thin veins severed cleanly. They would try to scream, but they would only choke on the crimson gore that filled their lungs.\n"
"\n"
"I delighted in death. It filled me with a pleasure I could find in no other activity. This was my life. This was who I was.\n"
"\n"
"People feared me. Loved me. And my brothers and sisters. Pushed us away, and then embraced us as the need arose.\n"
"\n"
"Some days we were hailed as heroes. Others, as murderers. Those in power fell to our secret blades. And then those who gave us the orders followed.\n"
"\n"
"But there was a mistake. A flaw in our process. We had grown too perfect. We had extracted justice from innocent blood.\n"
"\n"
"Such is the way, even with the most clear-cut contract. There is always a chance that the law is wrong. That it made a mistake. The contract never lies, but it isn't always correct, either. Even the smallest of actions, harmless as they may seem, can cause a tidal wave of destruction for those following behind.\n"
"\n"
"A fool's pride veils his judgment. In a moment of passion, blood scrawled upon the wall says it all. \"Morag Tong.\" Those words scream out, loud and insistent. They echo throughout the world, labeling us as ruthless killers that follow no rules, that have no laws.\n"
"\n"
"The Tong, always hidden, working in secret, suddenly fell under scrutiny. They wanted to drag us out of the shadows and into the light. We withdrew, deeper into the shadows. Our contracts became fewer, our jobs turned into small tasks. We ran errands for bored House nobles. We endured.\n"
"\n"
"And we obeyed. We remained loyal. We swore on our lives to uphold the cause, and we would not turn our backs on it now, no matter the level of difficulty facing us. Even if the world had turned its backs on us, we would stay the course.\n"
"\n"
"Our leaders whisper to us. They tell us to practice patience. They assure us that the day shall come when our hand of justice once again reaches out to grasp the world. A coming darkness will soon sweep the land.\n"
"\n"
"And the Morag Tong will once more be needed. Will once again become relevant.\n"
"\n"
"But I am old and my days wind down. I prepare for my trip to Vounoura, and I must pass this mantle to someone younger now. Someone less experienced, less wise. My son and my daughter will soon take up the dagger, but they have not seen our greatness. They must forge a new path for the Morag Tong.\n"
"\n"
"The darkness of war comes, and no one shall be spared from its wrath.\n"
"\n"
"The Morag Tong must put aside the wrongs it has endured. We must be ready."

"By Drelisa Hlaalu, House Historian\n"
"\n"
"War among the Great Houses of Morrowind isn't unique, and more often than not some kind of conflict between two or more Houses is under way somewhere across the land. Rarely do these conflicts escalate from subterfuge and intrigue to all-out war, but open hostilities aren't unheard of in the history of Morrowind. Let me tell you about one of these wars.\n"
"\n"
"In 2E 559, House Hlaalu and House Dres advanced beyond the usual tensions and posturing and fielded squads of combatants south of Narsis, on the border of the Black Marsh. It wasn't the first time these two economic rivals had challenged each other, and it wouldn't be the last, but the actual war was memorable, both in scope and in the number of casualties that piled up over the course of the battles.\n"
"\n"
"House Hlaalu was determined to set up a trading post in the disputed territory. House Dres was just as determined not to let that happen. Halfway through the construction of the outpost, the House Hlaalu workers suddenly found themselves surrounded by Dres mercenaries. The small squad of Hlaalu guards assigned to protect the workers, led by Purilla Falen, quickly established defenses and prepared to defend the outpost. The Dres mercenaries, who outnumbered the Hlaalu guards five-to-one, assumed they would make short work of the defenders and have the post burned to the ground before the midday meal.\n"
"\n"
"But that's not the way it happened.\n"
"\n"
"Purilla and her guards repelled the first assault with relative ease. She was determined to hold the line, no matter the cost, until reinforcements arrived. To facilitate the appearance of aid, Purilla set the one wizard they brought with them to work on opening a portal to Narsis. If the guards could hold back the onslaught of the Dres mercenaries long enough, an open portal could provide a path for Hlaalu battle-merchants to pour out of to turn the tide of battle. They only needed a little time.\n"
"\n"
"As the wizard performed the portal ritual, Purilla and the defenders met each House Dres attack with skill and ferocity. The mercenaries rushed in, sending a wave of attackers at the post's barricades. Each wave was turned away, but not without a cost. After five hours and four separate waves of attacks, Purilla's forces were reduced to a third of their original size. By then only Purilla and six guards remained to fend off the next Dres assault. And the wizard required a few more minutes to complete the ritual and open the portal. \"You shall have that time!\" Purilla proclaimed. \"For Hlaalu!\"\n"
"\n"
"The seven defenders, magnificent in their fury, fought with honor and savage resolve as the wizard completed the final steps of the ritual. One guard fell. Two. Four. Now only Purilla and two Hlaalu guards remained at the battlements. The Hlaalu workers, who had been providing support and watchful eyes throughout the previous battles, took to the walls as well, using tools and the weapons of the fallen guards to help defend the post. For all their effort, it appeared that the crushing weight of the Dres assault was about to engulf them.\n"
"\n"
"And then the portal opened.\n"
"\n"
"House Hlaalu battle-merchants streamed through the portal, hurling spells and arrows into the ranks of the surprised mercenaries. A full cohort emerged from the portal and crashed against the wall of Dres mercenaries. The wall held for a few long moments, and then it shattered against the weight of the Hlaalu troops. Dres mercenaries fell in scores before their line finally broke and the remaining mercenaries turned to flee. The battle-merchants chased after them just long enough to make sure they were really routed, and then they formed up to secure the post.\n"
"\n"
"Brave and noble Purilla Falen was responsible for the Hlaalu victory that day, but she didn't survive the final battle. A Dres mercenary's blade had caught her in the neck as they were retreating. She was dead before a healer could reach her side. Thanks to histories like these, however, her efforts will never be forgotten."

"Observations on the Mabrigash\n"
"from the journals of Bonorion the Wanderer, 2E 568\n"
"\n"
"In Deshaan, I encountered a strange tribe of Dark Elf Ashlanders. They call themselves Mabrigash. Unlike their Vvardenfell brethren, this tribe is not nomadic and appears to have settled in an isolated region of Deshaan, a location they call the Vale of the Ghost Snake. I believe they have concocted the story of the perilous Ghost Snake to discourage outsiders from lingering too long in their village. Although, frankly, their rudeness, which rivals that of any of the more civilized Dark Elves I have ever met, is more than enough to drive outsiders away. However, my curiosity about this isolated tribe steeled me against their attitude. I remained nearby for a time, watching them and recording my observations. Forthwith, here are my findings on the Mabrigash:\n"
"\n"
"The Mabrigash do not welcome visitors.\n"
"\n"
"The Mabrigash appears to be a matriarchal society, and their females are definitely more dominant than males. They also seem to outnumber the males by a factor of three or four to one. I wouldn't say this society hates males, but they certainly don't trust them or like them very much. At least as far as I can tell.\n"
"\n"
"They claim a Ghost Snake gives them advice and watches over the Vale. I believe they use this so-called \"Ghost Snake\" to scare visitors away and to keep the village population in line.\n"
"\n"
"It appears they sacrifice their own tribe members to this mythical deity. The tribal elders encourage trials to honor this \"Ghost Snake,\" and many of these end in the death of the participants.\n"
"\n"
"Here is the legend of the Ghost Snake, as it was told to me by a charming little lady of some six or seven years of age. She approached me with absolutely no fear or hesitation. She asked me why I was being so creepy and watching them all the time. At least, that was the gist of it. My understanding of the Mabrigash dialect is rudimentary, at best. I deflected her question with one of my own. \"What is this Ghost Snake I keep hearing about?\" I asked her.\n"
"\n"
"\"Follow the Coiled Path and you'll find out,\" she replied with a bat of her cute little eyelashes. \"The Ghost Snake offers advice and protection, as long as we care for the Vale,\" she continued. \"Everybody knows that.\" She went on to tell me that the Ghost Snake was the combined spiritual essence of the tribe's female ancestors, given spectral form by the belief and respect of the living tribe members. Or that it was a creepy dead snake that liked to haunt the Vale and eat innocent Mabrigash children. She spoke very fast, and as I've said before, my mastery of the dialect was far from perfect.\n"
"\n"
"From an economic perspective, the tribe crafts unique snakeskin leather. They use this leather for everything, from clothing to packs to a simple armor. They are, however, unwilling to sell or trade this wonderful material to outsiders—or even to the men of their own tribe. Everyone involved could make a fortune if the Mabrigash could be convinced to open trade with the outside world.\n"
"\n"
"I met a Mabrigash scout on patrol. She threatened to \"toss me to the ghosts and serpents on the Coiled Path.\" Fortunately, my speed and tree-climbing skills far exceeded hers, so I was able to avoid this savage ceremonial rite. Additional observation leads me to the conclusion that the tribe subsists on a diet primarily consisting of snake meat. This may contribute to their uncontrollably hostile demeanor.\n"
"\n"
"After several days camping nearby and continuing my observations, a rather fearsome Mabrigash warrior visited me. He said he was the Gulakhan. He said the only reason they had not simply tossed me to the serpents within the Vale was that the Farseer labeled me a hapless idiot. I am sure I missed something in the translation of the message. When I asked to meet with the Farseer, this Gulakhan's hand seemed to tighten on the hilt of the rather nasty-looking sword that hung at his side. It was then I decided that my time among the Mabrigash Tribe had come to an end.\n"
"\n"
"***\n"
"\n"
"Annotation from Nuros Raloro, Tribunal Scholar Priest, Mournhold 2E 576\n"
"\n"
"This utterly ludicrous \"observation\" was found abandoned near the border to Stonefalls some years ago. The Bosmer chronicler Bonorion does not appear to have the wit of a five-year-old child when it comes to accurately recording unusual events or peoples. He resorts to making things up or taking wild leaps of illogic to come to his so-called \"conclusions.\" This document has been preserved within the Tribunal library and copies have been distributed, as he did at least conduct some conversations with the Mabrigash, and information on this tribe remains scarce."

"By Kireth Vanos, Dungeon-Delver Extraordinaire\n"
"\n"
"We know almost nothing about them, except that they left behind the most interesting and exciting ruins. You know who I'm talking about. That's right! The Dwarves—or the Dwemer, for the scholars among you who might be reading this. (My brother Raynor insists I call them Dwemer, but I like the name Dwarves better. It rolls off the tongue, in my opinion.)\n"
"\n"
"Now, dungeon-delving is serious work (no matter how much fun it might be), and can be pretty dangerous besides. Just finding a Dwarven ruin is no small accomplishment, but getting into one and back out again in one piece can be next to impossible. But before I get to that, let's talk about the ruins themselves.\n"
"\n"
"Dwarves created a vast network of underground complexes and cities. Why they preferred to build beneath rock and soil, I couldn't say, but that's where they built them. So that's where you'll have to go if you want to visit a Dwarven ruin. Once you do find one, you'll know it. Dwarven architecture has a distinctive look and feel, from the surface entryways to the subterranean structures. They utilized natural openings in the rock wherever possible, tending to decorate and carve existing rock and natural pillars. They only built new structures when it was absolutely necessary, usually to support other structures or to install fortifications.\n"
"\n"
"In addition to carving and shaping the natural rock, Dwarves used stone as their primary building material. Some metal appears within their ruins, primarily brass, used as accents and in mechanical construction. And here's the really exciting part: Dwarves loved their gadgets, and their ruins are full of them! I don't mean just traps, though some of the most devious were designed and built by the long-gone Dwarves. I mean heating and cooling systems made up of steam pistons and great gears, glowing lights that shine from the walls, giant wheels that turn as water cascades over them, multifaceted gems that fire beams of light, and many other wonders too numerous to mention.\n"
"\n"
"It's eerie to walk through a Dwarven ruin. It's supposed to be empty, deserted, but the lights continue to glow and the pipes continue to steam. It's like the place is waiting for someone to return, as though the Dwarves just stepped out for a moment and haven't been gone for hundreds of years.\n"
"\n"
"Then there are the inhabitants of the ruins, for a Dwarven complex isn't as devoid of life as you might think. In fact, some of the ruins virtually teem with the stuff. But it isn't life as you or I know it. It's mechanical life. Constructs. They wander the chambers and corridors of these dungeons, performing tasks assigned to them in ages past. But make no mistake, if a construct spots you, it will attack you. With whirring blades and piston-powered swords, the Dwarven constructs pose a significant threat to any would-be dungeon-delver. Worse, the constructs know how to repair each other, so the ruins seem to contain an endless supply of the mechanical creatures.\n"
"\n"
"So, to successfully enter and exit a Dwarven ruin, you need to spot and disarm (or otherwise bypass) devious traps, avoid or defeat an army of increasingly more powerful wandering constructs, and figure out how to open strange locks that might or might not require something that looks like a key. It can be a bit maddening, but personally I find the challenge to be remarkably fun. \n"
"\n"
"Of course, everything I've written thus far has been theory and conjecture. My brother and I have yet to enter a Dwarven ruin, and all of our practice has been within the mundane dungeons that dot the land. But I've read all the books! We've finally acquired the funding we need to tackle the Dwarven ruin known as Bthanual, and I plan to write about that adventure in the very near future.\n"

"Welcome to Shad Astula, the Academy of Magic! This is where the most talented mages of the Ebonheart Pact come to learn, share a common origin, and become leaders in the magical community. Your journey begins here.  \n"
"\n"
"For many, the journey to master magic is fraught with frustration and difficulty. The training provided here can lead to a life of service and rewarding work, thanks to the availability of the best teachers and teaching methods. The fact of the matter is, while everyone invited to the Academy is selected for their potential for greatness, not all of you will measure up to the task before you. For those unfortunate enough to fail, Shad Astula serves as a safety net, a place to refine one's meager skills without causing harm to oneself or to others.\n"
"\n"
"But you will not fail. You are not one of the unfortunates. You will rise above. You will take your place as a leader in the Ebonheart Pact!\n"
"\n"
"You have already realized that you are different from others who can wield the gift of magicka. Now, prepare to be introduced to a world of power. For you, Shad Astula serves as a place where you can spread your wings. With the help of our staff of master mages, you will not only learn to fly, you will soar!\n"
"\n"
"As one of the chosen of the Academy, the usual restrictions and rules that govern the learning of magic do not apply to you. Those rules exist to ensure the safety of mages who may pose a danger to themselves or to others. We anticipate that the Academy's select students will excel, and we believe you're capable of learning your limits quickly. A few guidelines do apply, however:\n"
"\n"
"     —Do not summon creatures from Oblivion planes, except within designated summoning circles.\n"
"     —Magical experimentation on other Academy students is forbidden.\n"
"     —Magical experimentation on non-Academy members is discouraged, but use your best judgment.\n"
"     —Magical experimentation on staff is encouraged. Keep them on their guard, and they'll do the same for you.\n"
"     —Designation of assistants as \"minions\" is strictly prohibited, and cultist or cabalist behaviors or organizations will be dealt with swiftly and harshly. Save your megalomania for after graduation.\n"
"     —Students who have not passed the Emotional Control and Mental Stability Exam (ECMSE) are forbidden from sharing a room.\n"
"     —Magical dueling is strictly prohibited, except under a staff Battlemage's supervision.\n"
"\n"
"You will soon receive an appointment with the Headmaster, who will have more to say about Shad Astula and your status as a member of the Academy. In the meantime, feel free to explore the campus and introduce yourself to your fellow students. Some will become your peers, others your underlings, and a very select few your betters. Learn them well.\n"
"\n"
"Welcome to Shad Astula. Spread your wings and soar! We expect much of you. Do not disappoint us."

"Developing and maintaining a kwama mine can be a rewarding, and more importantly, a lucrative pursuit, provided one takes the time to learn about kwama and their environmental requirements. Kwama are giant insects that live and work in underground colonies called egg mines. Although eggs provide the primary source of income for any kwama mine, they are by no means the only product produced by the mine. Kwama cuttle, scrib jelly, and scrib jerky all provide additional sources of revenue for a kwama mine.\n"
"\n"
"To start a kwama mine:\n"
"\n"
"1a. Find and tame a wild kwama colony (difficult), or\n"
"1b. Purchase excess kwama from a crowded mine (expensive)\n"
"2. Live near the colony until you smell like kwama\n"
"3. Never approach the kwama queen chamber\n"
"4. Gather eggs, collect cuttle\n"
"5. Count your profit\n"
"\n"
"Despite the name, a kwama mine consists of living creatures. With judicious yet unobtrusive maintenance, a moderately-sized mine can produce an abundance of valuable kwama eggs. Kwama mines can also produce tasty scrib jerky, acidic scrib jelly, and kwama cuttle, which is highly valued by alchemists.\n"
"\n"
"The Kwama Colony: The road to owning a profitable mining concern starts with a healthy kwama queen and a full complement of workers. The queen produces eggs in the deepest recesses of the mine. Kwama workers care for the eggs, moving them to the various tunnels and chambers within the mine, according to space requirements, environmental conditions, and the development state of the eggs. Kwama workers also produce food for the mine, feed and clean the queen, and expand the mine complex as the colony grows. When not tending to their usual duties, workers can be seen digging new chambers and tunnels within the ever-growing labyrinth of the mine. Workers tend to be docile, but can turn violent if threatened or attacked, or if the queen is in danger.\n"
"\n"
"Kwama warriors protect the colony, reacting quickly to any perceived danger. They should be treated warily and with respect, for they are aggressive and highly dangerous. While workers are quadrupeds, warriors are bipedal and very powerful.\n"
"\n"
"Scribs, as the miners call juvenile kwama, roam freely through a kwama colony. A mine usually splits the scrib herds into two camps: those allowed to grow into workers or warriors, and those harvested while still young for jelly and jerky. Scrib jelly has a variety of uses, including as a food source, but it is prized by alchemists as a key ingredient to create potions and cure diseases. Scrib jerky, made by drying thin slices of scrib meat, has minor restorative properties and is considered to be quite delicious by Dark Elf culinary experts.\n"
"\n"
"Starting a Kwama Mine: Assuming you don't want to pay the exorbitant fees associated with purchasing a queen and kwama from an established mine, you will need to locate and tame a wild colony. This approach isn't without cost, however, as House Hlaalu requires would-be mine owners to purchase a license before hunting for a wild colony in earnest.\n"
"\n"
"When you locate a potential colony, you can't simply walk in and set up shop. The colony's aggressive warriors would make short work of your miners. There is a solution: acclimation. The acclimation process takes time, but injury and loss of life (of both colony members and miners) can be minimized by letting the colony slowly become familiar and comfortable with your presence. Once your miners acquire the smell of the local kwama, the warriors will consider them to be part of the colony.  \n"
"\n"
"Egg Harvesting: The actual \"mining\" of kwama eggs doesn't require a great deal of skill. Miners basically need only patience and common sense to perform their job. Egg harvesting must be done with an eye toward balance. Remove too many eggs and you may agitate the workers and the queen. Remove too few and the queen's egg production may fall. The mine manager must keep a careful eye on production to ensure that the queen does not produce too many or too few eggs. Wide swings in production will affect profits and make planning more difficult, and should be avoided.\n"
"\n"
"Avoid the queen's chamber at all times. Warriors and workers will view any approach to their queen as a threat and react accordingly. Production can grind to a halt as the colony becomes agitated and miners can't safely enter the mine. You might lose a few miners as the colony rampages, but the most important thing to remember is that the kwama will eventually calm down and once again accept the presence of the miners.\n"
"\n"
"Note: House Hlaalu egg-mining licenses require mines to provide regular production reports. Failure to comply can result in sanctions, fines, or even closure of the mine. And that's neither fun nor profitable."

"크와마와 크와마가 사는 환경을 공부하는 데 시간을 투자한 사람에게라면 크와마 광산 운영은 보람있고, 더 중요하게는 돈을 가져다주는 일거리가 될 수 있다. 크와마란 알 광산이라고 부르는 지하에 서식하는 거대한 벌레이다. 크와마 알이 크와마 광산의 주 소득원이기는 하나, 유일한 생산물이라는 이야기는 절대 아니다. 크와마 커틀, 스크립 젤리, 스크립 육포는 모두 크와마 광산의 추가 소득원이다.\n"
"\n"
"크와마 광산업 시작과정:\n"
"\n"
"1-a. 야생 크와마 무리를 찾아서 길들인다(어려움)\n"
"\n"
"또는,\n"
"\n"
"1-b. 이미 많은 크와마가 있는 광산에서 크와마를 구입한다(비용이 많이 듦).\n"
"\n"
"2. 자신에게서 크와마 냄새가 날 때까지 크와마 무리 근처에 살 것.\n"
"\n"
"3. 크와마 여왕의 방에는 절대로 가까이 가지 않는다.\n"
"\n"
"4. 알을 줍고, 커틀을 수확한다.\n"
"\n"
"5. 벌어들인 돈을 센다.\n"
"\n"
"이름과는 달리 크와마 광산은 살아있는 생명으로 차 있는 곳이다. 크와마에게 방해되지 않게 세심히 관리하면, 보통 크기의 광산에서도 풍부한 양의 값진 크와마 알들이 생산된다. 크와마 광산에서는 맛있는 스크립 육포, 신맛 나는 스크립 젤리, 그리고 연금술사들이 높이 사는 크와마 커틀도 생산된다.\n"
"\n"
"크와마의 무리사회: 높은 이윤을 내는 크와마 광산을 소유하는 길은 건강한 여왕크와마와, 그를 잘 보조하는 일꾼들에게서 시작한다. 여왕크와마는 광산의 가장 깊고 후미진 곳에 알을 낳는다. 일꾼크와마들은 알을 돌보며, 굴의 공간과 주변 환경 상태, 그리고 알의 발달상태에 따라 알들을 터널과 방 이곳저곳으로 옮긴다. 일꾼크와마들은 또한 먹이를 생산하고, 여왕을 먹이고 씻기며, 무리가 커짐에 따라 광산을 확장하는 일도 한다. 평소 하는 일들을 하고 있지 않을 때에는 무한히 확장하는 미궁과도 같은 광산 안에 새로운 방과 터널을 파내는 일꾼들을 볼 수 있다. 일꾼크와마들은 유순하나, 위협을 느끼거나 공격당했을 때, 혹은 여왕이 위험에 처했을 때에는 공격적으로 변할 수 있다.\n"
"\n"
"병정크와마들은 무리를 지키며, 위험이 감지되면 재빨리 행동한다. 병정크와마를 대할 때는 방심하면 안 되고 자극하지 않아야 한다. 그들은 공격적이고 아주 위험하다. 일꾼크와마들은 사족보행을 하지만, 병정들은 이족보행을 하며 아주 강하다.\n"
"\n"
"크와마 광산업자들은 어린 크와마를 스크립이라고 부른다. 스크립은 크와마 무리 사이를 자유롭게 다닌다. 보통 광산에서는 스크립을 두 무리로 나누어 관리한다. 일꾼이나 병정크와마로 자라게 두는 무리와, 어릴 때 도살하여 젤리와 육포를 얻는 무리이다. 스크립 젤리는 음식 재료로 쓰이는 것을 포함해 다양한 용도가 있지만, 특히 연금술사들이 포션을 만들거나 질병을 치료하는 데 꼭 필요한 핵심 재료이다. 스크립 고기를 얇게 저며 말린 스크립 육포는 강장 효과가 약간 있으며, 다크 엘프 요리 전문가들에게 별미로 통한다.\n"
"\n"
"크와마 광산을 시작하려면: 이미 운영되는 광산에서 말도 안 되는 값을 주고 크와마 여왕과 다른 크와마들을 구매하려는 게 아니라면, 야생 크와마 무리를 찾아서 길들여야 한다. 이 방법 또한 아예 비용이 들지 않는 것은 아닌데, 광산 소유주가 되려는 사람은 본격적으로 야생 크와마를 찾아 나서기 전에 할루 가문의 허가증을 구입해야 하기 때문이다.\n"
"\n"
"길들일 만한 무리를 발견한 뒤에도, 그냥 걸어 들어가서 사업을 시작할 순 없다. 공격적인 병정크와마들이 광산 노동자들을 해치워 버릴 것이다. 그 해결책으로 순치가 필요하다. 순치 과정에는 시간이 드나, 무리가 당신의 존재에 서서히 익숙해지게 함으로서 무리의 크와마와 광산 노동자 모두의 부상이나 사망을 막을 수 있다. 광산 노동자들에게서 그 지역 크와마의 냄새가 나기 시작하면, 병정크와마들은 노동자들을 무리의 일부로 여기게 될 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"알 수확하기: 크와마 알을 ‘채굴’하는 일에는 별다른 기술이 필요 없다. 광산 노동자들에게는 참을성 약간과 일반 상식만 있으면 된다. 알 수확은 균형을 주시하며 이루어져야 한다. 너무 많은 알을 가져가면 일꾼들과 여왕이 동요하게 된다. 너무 적은 알을 가져가면 여왕크와마의 알 생산량이 감소한다. 광산 관리감독은 여왕이 알을 너무 많이 낳거나 너무 적게 낳지는 않는지 항상 생산량을 눈여겨보아야 한다. 생산량의 급변은 이윤에 영향을 주고 계획을 세우는 것을 어렵게 하므로 피해야 한다.\n"
"\n"
"절대 여왕의 방에 가까이 가지 않도록 한다. 일꾼과 병정크와마들은 여왕에게 다가가는 무엇이든 위협으로 간주하고 반응한다. 알 생산은 중단될 가능성이 있고 무리가 동요하여 노동자들이 안전하게 광산 안으로 들어갈 수 없게 된다. 무리가 날뛰면 일꾼 몇을 잃게 될 수도 있으나, 가장 중요한 사실은 결국 언젠가는 크와마들이 진정하게 되고 광산 노동자들의 존재를 다시 받아들이게 된다는 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"참고: 할루 가문의 크와마 광산 허가에는 정기적인 생산량 보고 조건이 있다. 이를 지키지 못할 시에는 제재가 가해질 수 있고, 벌금을 물거나 심할 경우 광산이 폐쇄될 수도 있다. 재미도 없고 돈도 안 되는 일이다."

"A number of powerful healing relics are associated with Saint Veloth the Pilgrim. Of these, perhaps the most famous and well-remembered artifact remains the Judgment of Saint Veloth. This mighty Daedric warhammer stands as a shining symbol of everything Veloth embodies as the patron saint of outcasts and seekers of spiritual knowledge.\n"
"\n"
"Stored with other holy artifacts in the protected vaults of the Tribunal Temple, the Judgment of Saint Veloth served the prophet and mystic well in life, but has gained legendary powers since his ascension to sainthood. The God-Kings of Morrowind watch over the relics, keeping them ready for the day when their powers would be needed in defense of the realm.\n"
"\n"
"Saint Veloth personifies daring, and those who follow the lessons of his life and teachings learn boldness and cultivate an adventurous outlook. He defined the difference between good and evil Daedra, and even negotiated the original arrangements with the good Daedric Princes. This ability to distinguish the good from the bad was a hallmark of the living saint, as was his penchant for healing and healing items. Both of these aspects combined into his personal symbol of power, the warhammer known as Judgment.\n"
"\n"
"Veloth's Judgment rang with authority throughout the land, using its enchantments to cleanse corruption from the souls of those it struck down. It was a weapon, of that there can be no doubt. But Veloth was able to wield it with the same precision that a surgeon uses to wield a scalpel, removing the corruption from a soul and leaving the remainder alive and healthy. The warhammer stored the corruption for a time, turning it into energy that could be used by the wielder to enhance the power of the weapon.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, in the wrong hands such a powerful artifact could accomplish more harm than good. For this reason, among many others, the Tribunal keeps the Judgment and other artifacts locked away. It has been suggested that instead of being used as an instrument of healing, the Judgment could be used to siphon a living creature's entire soul, thus making the wielder infinitely more powerful. This conjecture has never been put into practice, and if the Tribunal has its way, it never will."

"No other religion in all of Nirn can claim what the Dark Elves know as absolute truth: their gods rule over them and walk among them, as real and as present as any other resident of Morrowind. From their seat of power in Mournhold's Tribunal Temple, the Living Gods of the Tribunal guard and counsel their people. When necessary, they punish sin and error, but they also share their bounty with the greatest and least among us, each according to their needs.\n"

As the three God-Kings of Morrowind, they form the divine leadership of the Dunmer nation. The Three—Lord, Mother, and Wizard—are described below.\n"
"\n"
"Vivec, the warrior-poet god and Master of Morrowind, is perhaps the most popular of the Three. He also tends to be the most public, and the people love him. His visage appears both beautiful and bloody at the same time, and he has made violence into an art form. Vivec the warrior-poet has darker aspects associated with primitive, ruthless impulses, such as lust and murder.\n"

"Almalexia, also known as Mother Morrowind, is the patron of healers and teachers. She is the Healing Mother, the source of compassion and sympathy, the protector of the poor and the weak. Almalexia embodies the best of Dunmeri culture and purpose. She exemplifies mercy, and her wisdom guides the Dark Elves in all their daily affairs.\n"

"Sotha Sil, God of the World-Mechanism, is the least known and most hidden of the Tribunal gods. Sometimes referred to as the Mystery of Morrowind, he is a Magus and the patron of artificers and wizards. Perhaps the mightiest wizard in the land and certainly the wisest, he is considered to be the Light of Knowledge and the inspiration behind craft and sorcery.\n"

But one of the Argonians that works for me was able to translate some of the markings in this place. It speaks of a balance that once existed between two tribes. One tribe dedicated themselves to shadow, and the other to the light of the sun. The interplay between these two tribes was said to be the key to the power of old Argonia. The temple we uncovered belonged to the tribe that followed the shadow, though if you ask me there's no evidence that they were anything but crazed lizards practicing ritual sacrifice. The temple of the sun is spoken of as if it is nearby, but there are many doors that remain closed to us here.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"If you spend any time in the pristine wildernesses of the Summerset Isles, you will see no shortage of flora and fauna that will take your breath away, but if you are truly blessed, you may glimpse one of the most storied creatures in history: the indrik. It's a privilege I've had only a handful of times, as wild indriks are wary by nature and exceptionally elusive. It's said that they can vanish in an instant when gazed upon by those with impure intent.\n"
"\n"
"It feels trite to say that you will know an indrik when you see one, but few words seem up to the task of describing the creatures. A folk tale as old as the Altmer civilization tells of how Y'ffre the Singer wove indriks out of the very essence of the forest, giving them the aspect of every living thing found within. You might, with the briefest of glances, mistake one for a common deer, but even the most casual observation will reveal indriks are so much more. \n"
"\n"
"The first thing likely to catch your eye about indriks are their antlers. Points of the finest crystal sprout from their crowns like the branches of some great, glimmering tree. This mesmerizing sight has been the end of many an ambitious hunter who thought the rack would make a fine prize. Let down your guard, for even a moment, and you risk being impaled by the stately lance jutting out from an indrik's forehead. There are countless legends surrounding the indrik's horn: that they are an alchemical cure-all, that touching one will extend your life seven-fold, even that they're made from Y'ffre's tears. All I can truly tell you is that an indrik's horn is both beautiful and deadly. If you believe what I've described thus far to be far-fetched, I've yet to even begin.\n"
"\n"
"The body of an indrik is covered in a tapestry of fur, feathers, and fronds that defy classification. One might ask themselves: are they animal, bird, or plant? Can they be all of those things at once? They might not be any of those things at all. Some scholars theorize that indriks are divine beings, not truly of this world, closer to Aedra than mortal. One fable tells of a Mer who kills an indrik, only to find its heart is pure crystal. He decides to give the perfect gem to his ladylove, but she is so beguiled by its splendor that her avarice taints the perfect gem, cursing it. From then on, the couple's lives are filled with such sorrow that they cast themselves into the sea, leaving their kin to fight over the precious gem and carry on the curse. A fanciful tale, but while there is no doubt that indriks are inherently magical, I've found scant evidence indicating that they are literally the stuff of magic.\n"
"\n"
"I suppose I should mention that they possess four ears. For any other animal that would surely stand out, but given what I've already described, I'm sure you'll agree that it hardly seems noteworthy. Presumably, this trait helps them appraise their surroundings and evade threats, but I'm certain there's a story out there somewhere claiming one pair is for hearing in the physical world and the other the spiritual. Until the indriks are studied more closely, they will continue to remain creatures surrounded by myth, but I can't help but feel like these creatures would be diminished by having their secrets laid bare. After all, who doesn't enjoy a little mystery in the world?"

"By Felarian, Jewelry Crafting Artisan\n"
"\n"
"Inside each of us is a stone: rough, rugged, unassuming. But beneath its jagged surface shines a color, a gleam of possibility, unrefined but full of promise. And with just a little polish, that stone has the potential to become a beautiful, glittering gem.\n"
"\n"
"The art of jewelry crafting rests within us all, but not everyone has the ability to see that capacity. Therefore, I've taken it upon myself to write a guide to how one may begin to polish his or her skill. And through these simple steps, any novice can learn the basics of jewelry crafting.\n"
"\n"
"Acquiring the Pewter Dust\n"
"\n"
"Pewter is an excellent material for any novice to begin with. Not only is it easily malleable, it is also absurdly abundant. One must simply keep an eye out for pewter seams within the wilderness. Much like ores, you'll generally find these seams within rocky outcroppings. There, you can easily acquire the needed pewter dust to begin your crafting.\n"
"\n"
"Refining the Pewter Ounces\n"
"\n"
"Next, one must refine their pewter dust into pewter ounces. You can do this at any jewelry crafting station you happen upon, which can generally be found within large cities. Of course, I would also recommend placing a personal crafting station within your home, if possible. I've found the convenience to be well worth the cost.\n"
"\n"
"Crafting the Ring\n"
"\n"
"Now is the time to put those pewter ounces to good use. While a simple pewter ring may not seem the most glamorous item to craft, it is certainly an excellent item to begin with. Again, a jewelry crafting station is needed to complete this task.\n"
"\n"
"Deconstructing Jewelry\n"
"\n"
"A jewelry crafting station can be used to not only craft jewelry, but also to deconstruct it. Deconstruction allows you to regain a portion of the ingredients used to create the ring or necklace. For example, a deconstructed pewter ring will give you pewter ounces. Of course, as in most aspects of crafting, this will also enable you to gain experience.\n"
"\n"
"Researching Traits\n"
"\n"
"Jewelry, while beautiful in its own right, can also be extremely useful. Given the right traits, your rings and necklaces can help increase health, stamina, and even magicka reserves. To craft jewelry with a desired trait, you must first research a piece of jewelry that already possesses that trait. If you find a pewter ring with the robust trait, for example, researching that ring will help you create new pieces of jewelry that are also robust. Sadly, this process always destroys whatever item is researched. But such is progress.\n"
"\n"
"Final Word\n"
"\n"
"It is my sincere hope that this guide has inspired you to begin delving into the glorious art of jewelry crafting. With just these few basics in mind, anyone can start their journey to become a true artisan. And on that note, I wish you the best of luck with your endeavors!"

"We found the Chill Hollow today. It's a winding depression in the rock filled with ice and snow. It looks like someone got here before us. Poor Hjalo. He should have brought along a few friends!\n"

"Day 3\n"
"After two days of hunting through these tunnels of ice, I think we finally cleared out all the wolves. With that taken care of, we can start digging for that gold the Bandit Lord Krogen supposedly hid within this frozen hole in the ground.\n"

"Strange sounds from deeper within the cave. Could be echoes of the noise we're making as we struggle to dig through the ice and rock. Or it could be something else. I think we'll post guards tonight.\n"

"Alfen disappeared last night. The others think he gave up and went home. But I don't think so. He was really looking forward to his share of the treasure. \n"

"Observations on the hags in Glenumbra's Hag Fens, from the journals of Bonorion the Wanderer, 2E 567\n"
"\n"
"I arrived at a rather watery area as I traveled through Glenumbra. It was full of odd trees and murky water.  When I asked a local what this place was, he said \"This is the Hag Fens. A swamp, as anyone with eyes can plainly see.\" I asked what I might find within, if I were to explore these Fens. The fellow responded rather tersely, \"Hags, you git. Why do you think we call it that?\" (I do enjoy speaking to the natives. It always adds an element of raw authenticity to my travels.)\n"
"\n"
"When pressed to explain about the hags, the local told me that they are some sort of witch. Exciting news! I like researching the different ways that magicka is employed across the land. I asked the taciturn fellow where I might find the ladies of the swamp and he made a rather rude noise. \"If ye're fool enough to go looking for the 'ladies,' as you call them, then head to the North Fens. Maybe they'll invite you to tea.\" Locals are always leery of those that use magic, but I am sure the swamp witches would welcome some scholarly discussion.\n"
"\n"
"***\n"
"\n"
"I found the area of the Fens where the hags dwell. Unfortunately, I lost one boot, my walking stick, and one of my packs to the rather aggressive crocodiles that also call these fens home. But I can see some of the tree dwellings that I believe belong to the hags nearby. I have been observing from my hiding place behind a small shrub. My notes forthwith:\n"
"\n"
"Hags have some strange deformity and rely on a walking staff to get around.\n"
"\n"
"The hags appear rather unkempt and are obviously old.\n"
"\n"
"Hags apparently use materials found in these Fens to craft attire that is rather rustic.\n"
"\n"
"There are a group of younger, prettier witches who do not abide with the elderly hags.\n"
"\n"
"Hags must send their menfolk off to work, as I have observed no male hags up to this point. Perhaps the males dwell in a separate camp? Note: Ask hags about their menfolk.\n"
"\n"
"One of the hags nearest my observation post seems to be cooking something in a rather large cauldron. A bit of hot stew and a cup of tea would be welcome after my mishaps in the swampy fens. I shall approach slowly, so as not to startle the elderly lady. \n"
"\n"
"— Notation from Wyress Galliane: \n"
"\n"
"We found a rather tattered Bosmer crawling out of the fens. He had barely survived an encounter with the hags and a crocodile or two. He was delirious and kept begging for tea and stew. We healed him and sent him on his way, although not before he attempted to proposition nearly every wyress in our camp. He left some of his notes, which we have preserved, though his complete lack of wit with regard to local creatures and customs, and his absurd observation skills, do not bode well for him surviving another journey."

"Warning: Reactions with Clockwork City soil may radically change a mushroom strain's expected properties. Only imbibe fungi after extensive testing using fabricant subjects. As the saying goes, you can eat all mushrooms, but some only once.\n"
"\n"
"Strain A-01-K: Large, flat caps, red. One stalk in cluster always white. Subject exhibited difficulty keeping balance after eating sample. Three gear clicks later, subject charged in unpredictable directions, often losing its balance while doing so. This resulted in a short delay in experimentation as factotums repaired damage to nearby equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Strain B-01-T: Medium-sized, puffy caps, white with blood-red spots. Subject ate sample rapidly, then proceeded to the next. Factotums had to react quickly to prevent subject from eating the entire batch.\n"
"\n"
"Strain C-02-K: Large white pods with black spots, grows in two- and three-pod clusters. Tested a two-pod cluster. Subject grew sick and died shortly after ingestion. Spore pods then grew on subject and burst when handled. Evacuated lab until factotums eradicated all spores. Note: Work out containment procedures before testing three-pod cluster.\n"
"\n"
"Strain D-01-K: Large, round slimy caps, mottled yellow and white. Subject started uncontrollably shivering after eating sample. Attempts by factotums to provide warmth failed. As subject was no longer of experimental use, it was disposed of.\n"
"\n"
"Strain E-02-K: Large to huge, drooping caps, gray. Subject's first attempt to consume a fully mature specimen resulted in the loss of several teeth and a minor stress fracture to the lower mandibular enhancement. Factotums coaxed subject to make a second attempt with an immature, smaller specimen. Subject extracted and ate the warts on the stalk with no ill effect. Note: Attempt to create weapons and armor out of mature stalks.\n"
"\n"
"Strain F-03-T: Medium-sized, wavy caps set in tiers, orange with white rim. Subject immediately evacuated contents of stomach onto the floor. Sent a sample to Idrono for analysis. Note: Reformulate factotums to ignore stains on floor. They become too obsessed maintaining sanitary conditions.\n"
"\n"
"Strain G-02-K: Large, bowl-shaped caps, mottled tan and orange with white-purple stalk. Subject devoured the sample and did not exhibit signs of hunger for two days after ingestion. Note: Conduct further experiments on the nutritional effects of this strain to determine cost effectiveness, as it is particularly labor-intensive to cultivate."

"GRIM HARLEQUIN STYLE\n"
"By Chamberlain Haskill\n"
"\n"
"My Lord Sheogorath has directed me to compile a guide for those seeking to create \"Grim Harlequin\" arms and armor, so that the Mad God's mortal servants may have a way to make all their equipment look the same. Of course, this standardization runs counter to all other cult practices, and is insane on the face of it. (Ahem.) Milord has probably already forgotten he asked me to do it, but what better do I have to do with my time than write manuals for mortals? \n"
"\n"
"Actually, almost anything, now that I think about it. \n"
"\n"
"AXES\n"
"\n"
"Curved crescent axe blades are specified, with edges of varying depth, and a complicated cluster of sharp, curved … somethings … at the haft. You know: what-you-may-call-ems. Also, grinning skulls. Put those on everything. \n"
"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"The belt shall be made of one, two, three, or four leather straps, of tanned Human or Elf skin, where possible. A grinning skull for the buckle, of course. Hip tassets may also sport skulls, wearing fool's caps and with tongues extended. The extended tongue is very important—a stylistic hallmark, really. \n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Pointed toes are required. This is not negotiable. Uppers may be of dark quilted motley, as you like. But nobody will be looking past the pointed toes: do that right, and the rest is gravy. Note: not actual gravy. Gravy may be implied, but is never stated.   \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"Now isn't this a pretty thing: seed pearls on the facing, and swooping recurved limbs that terminate in finials curled 'round large, lovely milk pearls. An instrument of death, but ornamented with nacreous excretions: simply splendid. Don't you think?  \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"Straps, straps, straps, and many layers—but not too rigid, not too confining, we do not wish to make it impossible to somersault. A Grim Harlequin must somersault, after all. As appropriate. (You'll know when.) Also: grinning skull sternum cameo. Very important!\n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"What we want here is more or less a curved poniard. Pointed, of course, but with a definite crescent edge, so it matches the swords and axes. The serrated back edge is handy for cleaning fish or grating cheese. A bastard to keep clean, though. \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"His Derangment has decreed that the fashion in Grim Harlequin gauntlets this season shall be for half-fingered gloves—the upper half. The lower digits shall remain nimble and free, so they can, as Milord Madness puts it, \"Dance like little rabbits from blade to bow and back again.\" The metaphor is strained, but you get the point, do you not? \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"Let your headgear be a cunning cowl that simultaneously evokes both a fool's cap and an executioner's hood—jolly but gruesome is the goal here, mortal. And there's nothing to lose by adding a mummy-wrap bandit's mask to the lighter sets, or a skull visor to the heavy. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"These should match the boots. I suppose. Just between you and me, to be quite candid, I have had no instructions from The Avuncular One in the matter of greaves or schynbalds. Not a peep. It's as if he didn't care what you put on your lower legs. Make of that what you will. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"The Grim Harlequin mace head is a grinning skull (naturally) wearing a fool's cap, with a long extended tongue that wraps right 'round the top of the haft. It's quite cunning, really. If I were a mortal, I'd want both the one-handed and the two-handed versions. But I'm not. \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Grinning skulls, fool's-capped jester faces, diamond quilting, those curving sharp what-you-may-call-em motifs: the Grim Harlequin shield has it all, really. Strap this on your off-arm, and they'll get out of your way in the grocery store, believe me. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"For your left pauldron? A grinning, grimacing jester-face with an upturned spade beard, of course. Oh, and another one on the right. Assuming symmetry is your goal. Who knows—it might be!\n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"I already effused about the fool's-capped grinning skull on the mace head; doing so again about the same motif on the finial of the Grim Harlequin staff would be just rather tedious. I would prefer not to.  \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"The swords should be long, curved single-edged blades—almost scimitars, really. The crossguard is another one of those clusters of curving overlapping sharp whatevers, you'll recognize it when you see it. And there, that's the Grim Harlequin guide, for what it's worth, which fortunately is not up to me."

"나의 주군이신 쉐오고라스님께서는 \"그림 할리퀸\"스타일의 무기와 방어구를 만드려는 자들을 위한 가이드를 작성하라고 지시하셨습니다. 덕분의 미친 신을 모시는 필멸자들이 모두 같은 모양의 장비를 갖추게 할 수 있게 하셨지요. 물론, 이런 규격화 된 것은 다른 모든 교단들의 교의, 관습과 상반됩니다, 때문에 얼핏보면 제정신이 아니라고 생각 될 만하지요(에헴). 뭐 아마, 제 주인께서는 벌써 제게 시키셨던 일도 기억 못하실게 분명하지만, 필멸자들을 위해 안내서를 쓰는 것보다 제 시간을 낭비하기에 더 좋은 일이 뭐가 있을까요?\n"

"\n"
"도끼\n"

"\n"
"벨트\n"

"벨트는 1개, 혹은 2개, 아니면 3개나 4개의 가죽끈을 엮어 만들어야 하며, 인간이나 엘프의 가죽을 무두질 하여 만든 가죽끈으로 제작되어야 합니다. 물론 버클에는 미소짓고있는 해골이 있어야 겠지요. 그리고 엉덩이 넓적다리싸개에는 멍청해 보이는 모자를 쓰고 혀를 내밀고 있는 두개골을 달면 좋겠군요. 혀를 내뱉고 있다는 부분이 중요합니다 — 그게 바로 이 스타일의 특징이니까요.\n"
"\n"
"부츠\n"
"\n"
"발끝은 뾰족하게 할 필요가 있지요. 이 의견은 협상이 불가능 합니다. 구두의 윗부분은 당신이 좋을 대로, 어두운 색의 여러가지 천들을 붙여도 됩니다. 하지만 뾰족한 발톱같은 부분은 빼두어서는 안됩니다: 그것을 제데로 했다면, 나중엔 그레이비(육수) 같은게 흘러 나올 겁니다. 참고 : 실제 그레이비를 말하는게 아닙니다. 그레이비는 일종의 은유입니다. 그러니 절대 나오지 않습니다. \n"
"\n"
"활\n"
"\n"
"자 이제 아름다운 물건의 차례이다 :바깥쪽으로 진주들을 심어주고, 크고 멋지게 그리고 둥글게 휘어진 활의, 가장자리 부분에는 사랑스러운 밀크펄 장식을 해야합니다. 죽이기 위해 사용되는 도구이지만, 화려한 진주를 내 뱉는 것 같다 : 단순하지만 아름답죠. 그렇게 생각하지 않습니까? \n"
"\n"
"흉갑의 일부분 \n"
"\n"
"끈, 끈, 끈, 그리고 많은 층으로 이루어 져있어야 합니다—하지만 너무 뻣뻣해 보이거나, 제한된 인상을 주어서는 안됩니다, 우리는 당신이 공중제비를 할 수 없게 하고 싶지 않습니다. 그래요 결국, 그림 할리퀸은 공중제비를 넘는것은 필수적인 요소이니까요. 물론 적절한 상황에서요. (당신도 그 때가 언제일이 알게 될겁니다.) 또한 : 흉골 카메오에 웃는 해골을 잊지마십시오. 매우 중요한 요소입니다!\n"
"\n"
"단검\n"
"\n"
"우리가 여기서 신경써야 할 점은 많게든 적게든 휘어진 단검의 날이다. 물론, 중요시 해야 할 점은, 칼이나 도끼와 같이 초승달형의 날을 가지고 있게 해야 한다는 것이다. 톱니모양의 날 윗부분은 생선을 손질하거나 치즈를 자를때 유용하다. 물론 당연하지만, 청결하게 유지해야한다.\n"
"\n"
"장갑\n"
"\n"
"그의 혼란은 이번 시즌 그림 할리퀸 장갑의 패션의 절반은 장갑의 손가락의 절반이 보여야 한다는  법령을 내리셨습니다 — 그러니까 윗부분의 반 말입니다.  제 광기의 주인께서 이야기 하신 것 처럼 당신의 손 아랫부분은 자유롭고 민첩해야 합니다. \" 칼과 활 사이를 작은 토끼처럼 춤을 추며 거닐도록. \" 비유가 사용되었지만, 당신이 요점을 이해했으리라 생각합니다, 그렇죠?\n"
"\n"
"헬멧\n"

"당신의 머리 장식이 정교한 고깔처럼 보이는 동시에, 광대의 모자와 사형 집행인을 떠올리록 만드십시오 — 우스꽝스럽게 보이면서도 섬뜩하게 보이는 것이 목표입니다, 필멸자여. 그리고 얼굴을 가리는 마스크는 산적들이 쓰는 마스크에 미라를 만드는 끊을 추가하거나, 중장비를 입을때는 두개골 장식을 추가하는것을 잊지 마십시오.\n"
"\n"
"각반\n"
"\n"
"이것들은 부츠와 매치가 되도록 만들어야 합니다. 아마 그렇겠지요. 이곳에다만 솔직하게 적자면, 이건 당신과 나사이의 이야기인데 말입니다, 솔직히 이 부분부터 저 아저씨에게서 말하는 각반이나 그리브는 어때야 한다는 등의 이야기는 전혀 듣지 못했습니다. 발 밑에 무엇을 입든 신경쓰지 않는 것 같으니. 원하는 데로 만드십시오.\n"
"\n"
"메이스\n"
"\n"
"그림 할리퀸 메이스의 앞부분에는 웃는 해골이 (자연스럽게) 붙어있어야 합니다. 두개골은 광대의 모자를 쓰고 있어야 하고 해골에서부터 나오는 혀가 자루를 오른쪽 방향 부터 덮어야 합니다. 만약 내가 필멸자라면 한손 무기로도 두손무기의 버전도 모두 원했겠지만. 유감스럽게도 전 필멸자가 아니닙니다.\n"
"\n"
"방패\n"
"\n"
"웃는 모양의 두개골, 모자를 쓴 광대같은 얼굴 , 다이아몬드 모양의 컷팅, 뭐라고 불리는 것이든 상관없이 예리하게 새겨진 디자인들: 그림 할리퀸 방패는 모든것을 다 가지고 있습니다, 정말입니다. 이것을 팔뚝에 붙이면 식료품점에서 방해자를 쉽게 밀어낼 수 있습니다. 절 믿으십시오.\n"
"\n"
"어깨 방어구\n"
"\n"
"당신의 왼쪽 견갑 말입니까? 물론, 활짝 웃고있으며, 얼굴을 찡그린 표정의 광대 얼굴을 하고 있으며, 앞으로 솟아나오는 턱수염을 가지고 있어야 합니다. 오, 그리고 오른쪽에도 하나 있어야 합니다. 균형있는 것이 당신의 목표라고 가정합시다. 누가 알겠습니까 - 그게 진짜일지! \n"
"\n"
"지팡이\n"
"\n"
"이미 광대 모자를 쓴 웃는 해골에 대해 메이스의 머리부분에서 설명했었습니다 ; 그림 할리퀸 지팡이의 마지막 부분도 같은 디자인으로 하면 됩니다. 같은 것을 다시 설명 하는 것은 다소 지루 할 것 같으니. 안하는게 좋겠군요.\n"
"\n"
"검\n"
"\n"
"칼은 길고 구부러진 모양이며 한쪽에만 날이 있어야 합니다—거의 언월도에 가깝게요. 칼날에 직각으로 붙은 날밑쪽에는 날카롭고 곡선이 겹치듯한 무늬를 새길 수 있을 겁니다, 당신도 보면 어느 부위인지 알 수 있을겁니다. 그리고 이상 그림 할리퀸 가이드 였습니다, 뭐 이것이 얼마나 도움이 될지, 도움이 알될지 가치가 있을지 없을지는, 다행스럽게도 제 알 바 아니라는 겁니다."

"By Lady Cinnabar of Taneth\n"
"\n"
"In Phrastus of Elinhir's spurious essay \"A Story of Blood: The Spinners Take Tamriel,\" he argues, in his trademark imaginative style, that the Wardens of the wilds are a militant faction of the Wood Elf priests known as the Spinners. I believe this assertion is either the result of a lack of proper academic rigor, or, just as likely, an attempt to manufacture controversy to appeal to the masses.\n"
"\n"
"In my own meticulous research, I have certainly found some similarities between the Spinners and Wardens. Like the Wood Elf priests, these guardians appear to have a close connection with the god Y'ffre, the deity of song and forest. \n"
"\n"
"However, in my opinion, this is where the similarities end, and just as I did with the famous coven in my seminal work \"The Glenmoril Wyrd,\" I shall take it upon myself to dispel the many myths and misunderstandings associated with these warriors. \n"
"\n"
"First and foremost, the Spinners are not militant or violent, preferring to allow others to fight for them and Valenwood, and to instead take on an advisory, scholarly, or priestly role within Bosmer society. By comparison, Wardens appear to be more than willing to shed blood to protect the wilds, and there are many reports of them attacking individuals, gangs, and even entire outposts that have done some harm to Y'ffre's realm. \n"
"\n"
"There also appear to be stark differences in the Wardens' powers from those of the Spinners. While the Bosmer priests reportedly draw stories from their past, present, and future to entrance their audience, Wardens seem to draw upon their natural environment to change and shape reality itself. In layman's terms, something I think my colleague Phrastus may appreciate, the Spinners appear to employ a kind of Illusionary magic, whereas the Wardens' abilities are more akin to what might traditionally be called Alteration or Conjuration.\n"
"\n"
"While the Spinners are a unique priestly order that is central to Bosmer culture, my studies have found no singular body or organization that represents the Wardens, and indeed they appear to mostly travel alone or in pairs, beholden to nobody. If they are members of any groups, it is the local Fighters or Mages Guilds, or even, in one poorly documented case, a member of the Dark Brotherhood.  \n"
"\n"
"Given their association with Y'ffre, are the Wardens predominantly Wood Elves? It does not seem so. While Spinners are exclusively made up of Bosmer, Wardens of all races—man, mer, or beast—that can be found protecting Tamriel's wilds. Indeed, I have met Wardens who hailed from the northernmost peaks of High Rock and from the southern forests of Elsweyr. I have even met a fellow native of Hammerfell.\n"
"\n"
"And what of the Green Pact? Do the Wardens adhere to the ancient Wood Elf tradition? With the exception, of course, of those who are both Warden and Wood Elf, this does not appear to be the case either. In my experience, most Wardens are, in fact, more than willing to make full use of nature's bounty in order to survive, including partaking of both its plant and animal life. \n"
"\n"
"Finally, the Spinners are found almost exclusively within the confines of Valenwood, and they rarely venture far beyond the protection of its ancient forests. Wardens, however, appear all over Tamriel, with the most recent reports placing some on the island of Vvardenfell. \n"
"\n"
"These are my early findings on the Wardens of Tamriel. They are a unique and mysterious group, similar to the Spinners, but also distinctly different. It is clear to me that greater academic inquiry is required, and I am sure upon further investigation, the rest of Phrastus of Elinhir's outrageous claims will be proven false (as they so often are.)"

"\n"

"\n"
"Thirty-fifth Day of Construction\n"
"Unexpected delays on the fourth Canton. Despite Lord Vivec's Blessings, accidents continue to pile up. I have had stern words with the Overseer, but she seems honestly mystified. Will send some Armigers to investigate.\n"
"\n"
"Fortieth Day of Construction\n"
"The Armigers can uncover no reason for the continuing delays. One reports seeing a large dog up on one of the supports just before the collapse that injured four workers. Others dismiss that as impossible—how would a dog climb the rails?—but I have my suspicions. Still, no reason to bother Lord Vivec.\n"

"\n"

"Standing on the construction Canton, I felt the Blessings of Lord Vivec wash over me. I marvel at the feeling of his love and protection. It is no wonder the workers strive so hard at their jobs.\n"
"\n"
"But then, almost like a cloud passing between Tamriel and the sun, it was gone. I could tell the workers and the guards felt it, too, though they certainly took it more as a sense of unease. Just as I was about to say something, I heard a crash. I looked over, and one of the lift-ropes had broken, causing two tons of stone to fall and shatter. It is a wonder no one was killed.\n"
"\n"
"As I ran to help the injured, I swear by Vivec's mighty presence I saw a large dog scamper away. I think my suspicions are confirmed. But whether to go after the dog or report to Vivec immediately—that is the choice I must make. Perhaps after a good night's sleep I will have a clearer idea of how to proceed."

"\n"
"The boy did not have to search long. He found a wonderfully chatty duck in the reeds who told him stories of places the boy could only dream of. Though he was quickly enchanted by the tales, the boy became melancholy that he would never see such a place with his own eyes. The duck laughed and told him that this was not so! They would build one together!\n"
"\n"
"The boy and the duck waded out to a small island on the lake and together they built a tiny house of sticks and sand. This sufficed for an hour, until the duck suggested that a house was not a fitting place for the boy. He deserved a palace! The mortar of mud would not be enough, but one of the adults might help.\n"
"\n"
"The boy went back to the cabin and found a noble who had stepped outside to relieve himself, so inebriated he was. He was easily coaxed into following the boy back to the island, where the duck leapt and tore out his throat to use blood and flesh for the mortar and bones for the beams. The boy was delighted, but the palace had to be bigger!\n"

Some may be myth, others may be hoax, but regardless, many have lost their lives attempting to find or protect these very coveted items.\n"
"\n"
"Skull Crusher\n"
"\n"
"The Skull Crusher is an amazingly large and powerful weapon. This warhammer was created in a fire, magically fueled by the Wizard, Dorach Gusal, and was forged by the great weaponsmith, Hilbongard Rolamus. The steel is magically hardened and the weight of the weapon is amazingly light, which makes for more powerful swings and deadly blows. The warhammer was to be put on display for a festival, but thieves got it first. The Skull Crusher still travels Tamriel in search of its creators.\n"
"\n"
"Spear of Bitter Mercy\n"
"\n"
"One of the more mysterious artifacts is the Spear of Bitter Mercy. Little to nothing is known about the Spear. There are no recorded histories but many believe it to be of Daedric origin.\n"
"\n"
"Spell Breaker\n"
"\n"
"Spell Breaker, superficially a Dwemer tower shield, is one of the most ancient relics of Tamriel. Aside from its historical importance in the Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, the Spell Breaker protects its wielder almost completely from any spell caster, either by reflecting magics or silencing any mage about to cast a spell. It is said that Spell Breaker still searches for its original owner, and will not remain the property of anyone else for long. For most, possessing Spell Breaker for any length of time is power enough.\n"
"\n"
"Staff of Hasedoki\n"
"\n"
"Hasedoki was said to have been a very competitive wizard. He wandered the land in search for a wizard who was greater than he. To the best of all knowledge, he never found a wizard who could meet up to his challenge. It is said that he felt so lonely and isolated because so many feared his power, that he bonded his life-force into his very own staff, where his soul remains to this very day. Magic users all over Tamriel have been searching for this magical staff. Granting its wielder a protection of magicka, it is a sure prize for any magic user.\n"
"\n"
"Staff of Magnus\n"
"\n"
"The Staff of Magnus, one of the elder artifacts of Tamriel, was a metaphysical battery of sorts for its creator, Magnus. When used, it absorbs an enemy's health and mystical energy. In time, the Staff will abandon the mage who wields it before he becomes too powerful and upsets the mystical balance it is sworn to protect.\n"
"\n"
"Umbra Sword\n"
"\n"
"The Umbra Sword was enchanted by the ancient witch Naenra Waerr, and its sole purpose was the entrapment of souls. Used in conjunction with a soul gem, the Sword allows the wielder the opportunity to imprison an enemy's soul in the gem. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but not before she was able to hide the Sword. The Umbra Sword is very choosy when it comes to owners and therefore remains hidden until a worthy one is found.\n"
"\n"
"Vampiric Ring\n"
"\n"
"One of the more deadly and rare artifacts in Tamriel is the Vampiric Ring. It is said that the Ring has the power to steal its victim's health and grant it to the wearer. The exact nature and origin of the Ring is wholly unknown, but many elders speak of its evil creation in Morrowind long, long ago by a cult of Vampire followers. The Vampiric Ring is an extremely rare artifact and is only seen every few hundred cycles of the moons.\n"
"\n"
"Warlock's Ring\n"
"\n"
"The Warlock's Ring of the Archmage Syrabane is one of the most popular relics of myth and fable. In Tamriel's ancient history, Syrabane saved all of the continent by judicious use of his Ring, and ever since, it has helped adventurers with less lofty goals. It is best known for its ability to reflect spells cast at its wearer and to improve his or her speed and to restore health. No adventurer can wear the Warlock's Ring for long, for it is said that the Ring is Syrabane's alone to command."

"Ice Blade of the Monarch\n"
"\n"
"The Ice Blade of the Monarch is truly one of Tamriel's most prized artifacts. Legend has it that the Evil Archmage Almion Celmo enchanted the claymore of a great warrior with the soul of a Frost Monarch, a stronger form of the more common Frost Atronach. The warrior, Thurgnarr Assi, was to play a part in the assassination of a great king in a far off land, and become the new leader. The assassination failed and the Archmage was imprisoned. The Ice Blade freezes all who feel its blade. The Blade circulates from owner to owner, never settling in one place for long.\n"

"\n"
"Sometimes called the Armor of Morihaus or the gift of Kynareth, this is an ancient cuirass of unsurpassable quality.

It is said that whenever Kynareth deigns the wearer unworthy, the Lord's Mail will be taken away and hidden for the next chosen one.\n"
"\n"
"Mace of Molag Bal\n"
"\n"
"Also known as the Vampire's Mace, the Mace of Molag Bal drains its victims of magicka and gives it to the bearer. It also has the ability to transfer an enemy's strength to its wielder. Molag Bal has been quite free with his artifact. There are many legends about the Mace. It seems to be a favorite for vanquishing wizards.\n"
"\n"
"Masque of Clavicus Vile\n"
"\n"
"Ever the vain one, Clavicus Vile made a masque suited to his own personality. The bearer of the Masque is more likely to get a positive response from the people of Tamriel. The higher his personality, the larger the bonus. The best known story of the Masque tells the tale of Avalea, a noblewoman of some renown. As a young girl, she was grossly disfigured by a spiteful servant. Avalea made a dark deal with Clavicus Vile and received the Masque in return. Though the Masque did not change her looks, suddenly she had the respect and admiration of everyone. A year and a day after her marriage to a well-connected baron, Clavicus Vile reclaimed the Masque. Although pregnant with his child, Avalea was banished from the Baron's household. Twenty-one years and one day later, Avalea's daughter claimed her vengeance by slaying the Baron.\n"

"The Dark Brotherhood has coveted this ebony dagger for generations. This mythical artifact is capable of slaying any creature instantly. History does not record any bearers of Mehrunes' Razor. However, the Dark Brotherhood was once decimated by a vicious internal power struggle. It is suspected that the Razor was involved.\n"
"\n"
"The Mentor's Ring\n"
"\n"
"This simple metal band is a prized possession for any apprentice to magic. It lends the wearer the ability to increase their intelligence and wisdom, thus making their use of magic more efficient. The High Wizard Carni Asron is said to be the creator of the Ring. It was a construct for his young apprentices while studying under his guidance. After Asron's death, the Ring and several other possessions vanished and have since circulated throughout Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"Ring of Khajiit\n"
"\n"
"The Ring of the Khajiit is an ancient relic, hundreds of years older than Rajhin, the thief that made the Ring famous. It was Rajhin who used the Ring's powers to make himself invisible and as quick as the breath of wind. Using the Ring, he became the most successful burglar in Elsweyr's history. Rajhin's eventual fate is a mystery, but according to legend, the Ring rebelled against such constant use and disappeared, leaving Rajhin helpless before his enemies.\n"
"\n"
"Ring of Phynaster\n"
"\n"
"The Ring of Phynaster was made hundreds of years ago by a man who needed good defenses to survive his adventurous life. Thanks to the Ring, Phynaster lived for hundreds of years, and since then it has passed from person to person. The Ring improves its wearer's overall resistance to poison, magicka, and shock. Still, Phynaster was cunning and cursed the Ring so that it eventually disappears from its holder's possessions and returns to another resting place, discontented to stay anywhere but with Phynaster himself.\n"
"\n"
"Ring of Surroundings\n"
"\n"
"Little is known of this prize but it is said that it lends the wearer the ability to blend in with their surroundings.\n"
"\n"
"Ring of the Wind\n"
"\n"
"No facts are known about this Ring, but the title and the few rumors lend one to think it grants the wearer added speed."

Such insight into the inner fabric of reality comes at a price. Each reading of the Elder Scrolls is more profound than the last. Each leaves the priest blind for longer and longer periods of time. Finally, the last reading achieves a nearly sublime understanding of that scroll's contents, but the priest is left permanently blinded to the light of this world.

"The Ayleids, or Heartland High Elves, ruled Cyrodiil in the long ages of Myth before the beginning of recorded history. One of the earliest recorded dates, in fact, is the Fall of White-Gold Tower in 1E 243, which is commonly assumed to mark the end of the Ayleids.\n"
"\n"
"Although Ayleid rule over Cyrodiil was broken in 1E 243, this was only one of the most obvious stages near the end of a long decline. The first two centuries of the First Era saw increasing strife between the great Ayleid lords of Cyrodiil. Alessia appears to have taken advantage of a period of civil war to launch her uprising. Imperial historians have traditionally attributed her victory to intervention from Skyrim, but it appears she had at least as much help from rebel Ayleid lords during the siege of White-Gold Tower.\n"
"\n"
"The popular image of the Ayleids as brutal slavemasters is based in fact, of course, but it is less well-known that a number of Ayleid princes continued to rule parts of Cyrodiil after 243 as vassals of the new Empress of Cyrodiil. This suggests either that Ayleid rule was not universally detested or that Alessia and her successors were more pragmatic than is traditionally believed (or perhaps some of both).\n"
"\n"
"In any event, excavations at a number of Ayleid sites show continued occupation and even expansion during the so-called Late Ayleid Period (1E 243 to c. 498). At first, many Ayleid lords continued to rule as vassals of the new human regime. In some cases, Ayleid supporters of Alessia were even rewarded with new lands taken from slain enemies. It is not clear to what extent human slavery continued under the Cyrodilic Empire. Humans continued to dwell in the Ayleid-ruled areas of Cyrodiil, but there is nothing definitive to show under what terms.\n"
"\n"
"This was an uneasy relationship from the beginning, and it was not destined to last long. Resentment at the continued presence of Ayleid nobles within the Empire was a contributing factor to the rise of the so-called Alessian Order founded by Maruhk. The first victims of the Alessians were the Ayleids of Cyrodiil. In the early 300s, the surviving Ayleid communities in human-ruled areas were obliterated one by one. The refugees temporarily swelled the power of the remaining Ayleid lordships.\n"
"\n"
"Then in 361, the Alessians gained control of the Empire and enforced the Alessian Doctrines throughout its domain. The Ayleid lordships were abolished. Enforcement of this decree does not appear to have required much direct violence. It seems that by this point the balance of power was so overwhelmingly against them and their fate so long foreshadowed that most of the remaining Ayleids simply left Cyrodiil, eventually being absorbed into the Elven populations of Valenwood and High Rock. Indeed, the rise of the Direnni Hegemony may be linked to this exodus of Ayleids from Cyrodiil (a connection so far studied very little by historians).\n"
"\n"
"Still, a remnant Ayleid population seems to have survived the rule of the Alessians, because we've heard of \"the last king of the Ayleids\" joining the battle of Glenumbria Moors, where the Dirennis decisively defeated the Alessians in 482. How this king's people survived the preceding century is unknown. We do not even know who they were, although recent research points to Nenalata as the possible resting place of this \"last king.\" Unfortunately, in the current state of the Empire, funds are no longer available for proper scientific investigation of such extensive ruins, so the answer to these questions will have to be left to future generations."

"에일리드, 혹은 하트랜드 하이 엘프들은 역사의 기록이 시작되기 이전인 신화시대에 오랫동안 시로딜을 통치했었다. 사실, 기록된 가장 빠른 날짜 중 하나는 1시대 243년의 백금탑의 함락이며, 일반적으로 이것이 에일리드들의 마지막이라고 추측하고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"비록 시로딜 전역에 대한 에일리드의 통치는 1시대 243년에 사실상 종결되었지만, 이것은 단지 기다란 종말의 끝에 가까운 가장 눈에 잘띄는 사건들 중의 하나였을 뿐이다. 우선 첫 번째 연대의 두 세기 동안 시로딜의 가장 유력한 에일리드 군주들 사이에서 권력 투쟁이 증가되는 양상을 보였다. 알레시아는 그녀의 봉기를 일으키는데 있어서 이같은 내전 기간의 이점을 취하면서 등장했다. 임페리얼 역사가들은 전통적으로 그녀의 승리를 스카이림의 개입 때문이었다고 생각하고 있지만, 그녀가 백금탑을 포위하는 동안 반란군인 다른 에일리드 군주들로부터 적어도 많은 도움을 받았음이 분명하다.\n"
"\n"
"잔인한 노예주인이라는 에일리드들의 일반적인 이미지는 물론 사실에 기초한 것이긴 하지만, 많은 수의 에일리드 군주들이 시로딜에 등장한 새로운 여황제의 봉신으로서 283년 후에도 여전히 시로딜의 일부분을 통치해갔다는 사실은 잘 알려져있지 않다. 이것은 에일리드들에 의한 통치가 보편적으로 혐오되어졌던 것은 아니거나, 혹은 알레시아와 그녀의 계승자들이 전통적으로 믿어지는 것보다 더 실용적이었거나, 혹은 둘다 해당되는 것인지도 모른다.\n"
"\n"
"많은 에일리드 유적지에서의 발굴은 에일리드들의 점유가 계속되었고, 심지어는 이른바 후기 에일리드 시기 (1시대 243년 ~ 498년경)라고 불리우는 기간동안 확장되어졌음을 보여주고 있다. 처음에 상당수의 에일리드 군주들은 새로운 인간의 통치시대에 봉신으로서 그 통치를 이어나갔다. 몇가지 사례를 보면, 알레시아의 에일리드 후원자들은 적들을 죽여서 새로운 토지를 보상으로 받기조차 했다. 시로딜릭 제국 아래에서 인간이 노예상태로 있었던 시기가 어느정도였는지는 명확하지 않다. 인간은 알레시안인들이 지배했던 시로딜 지역에서 계속 머물렀지만, 과연 그것이 어느 시기 동안이였는지를 보여주는 명확한 증거가 없다.\n"
"\n"
"이러한 인간과 에일리드의 동거는 시작부터 쉽지 않은 관계였고, 오랜동안 지속될 운명은 아니었다. 제국 내에서 여전히 에일리드 귀족들이 존재하고 있다는 것은 마루크에 의해 만들어진 이른바 알레시안 교단의 중흥에 기폭제가 되었다. 알레시안들의 첫 제물은 시로딜의 에일리드들이었다. 300년경 초기에, 생존했던 에일리드 공동체들은 인간이 지배하는 지역에서 마지막 하나까지 말끔히 일소되었고, 피난자들은 일시적으로 에일리드의 지배력이 남아있는 곳으로 몰려들었다.\n"
"\n"
"361년에 알레시안들은 황제의 제가를 얻어서 제국의 영토에 알레시안 독트린을 강행하게 만들었다. 에일리드 영주권력은 폐지되었다. 이 법령의 강행은 직접적인 폭력이 요구되어지는 것으로 나타나지는 않았다 -- 이것은 그들에게 대항할수 없는 힘의 균형의 끝이었으며, 오랜기간 예견되어진 그들의 숙명인 듯 보였다. 남아있던 에일리드들의 대부분은 시로딜을 떠났고, 일부는 발렌우드와 하이 락의 엘프주민들에게 흡수되었다. 사실, 디레니의 패권은 아마 시로딜로부터 탈출해온 에일리드와 연관되어 있을 것이다(이 연관관계는 역사가들에 의해 거의 연구되어지지 않았다).\n"
"\n"
"여전히 에일리드 잔여 인구는 알레시안들의 규칙 속에서 살아가고 있다. 왜냐하면 482년에 디레니가 알레시안들을 결정적으로 패배시켰던 장소인 글렌움브라 황야의 전장에 가보면 \"에일리드의 마지막 왕\"에 대한 이야기를 듣게 되기 때문이다. 이 왕의 민족들이 어떻게 이전 세기에 살아남았는지 알려진것은 없다. 비록 최근에 이 \"마지막 왕\" 의 가능성이 있는 장소로서 네날라타가 중점적으로 연구되고 있긴 하지만, 우리는 그들이 누구인지조차 모른다. 불행히도 제국의 현재 주들 중에서는 이같은 광범위한 유적들을 정밀하고 체계적으로 조사하기 위한 자금을 보유한 곳이 없다. 때문에 이 질문들에 대한 해답은 미래의 세대들에게 남겨져야만 할 것이다."

"In the first years of the First Era, a powerful race of Elves called the Ayleids, or the Heartland High Elves, ruled central Tamriel with an iron hand. The high and haughty Ayleids relied on their patrons, the treacherous Daedra Lords, to provide armies of Daedra and dead spirits. With these fearless magical armies, the Ayleids preyed without mercy upon the young races of men, slaughtering or enslaving them at their whim.\n"
"\n"
"On behalf of the suffering human races, St. Alessia, the first in the line of Cyrodiils, sought the aid of Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time, and ruler of the noble Aedra. Akatosh, looking with pity upon the plight of men, drew precious blood from his own heart, blessed St. Alessia with this blood of Dragons, and made a Covenant: so long as Alessia's generations were true to the dragon blood, Akatosh would endeavor to seal tight the Gates of Oblivion and deny the armies of Daedra and undead to their enemies, the Daedra-loving Ayleids.\n"
"\n"
"In token of this Covenant, Akatosh gave to Alessia and her descendants the Amulet of Kings and the Eternal Dragonfires of the Imperial City. Thus does Alessia become the first gem in the Cyrodilic Amulet of Kings. The gem is the Red Diamond in the middle of the Amulet. This is the Symbol of the Empire, surrounded by eight other gems, one for each of the Divines.\n"
"\n"
"So long as the Empire shall maintain its worship of Akatosh and his kin, and so long as Alessia's heirs shall bear the Amulet of Kings, Akatosh and his divine kin maintain a strong barrier between Tamriel and Oblivion, so that mortal man need never again fear the devastating summoned hosts of the Daedra Lords.\n"
"\n"
"If the Empire should slacken in its dedication to the Eight Divines, or if the blood of Alessia's heirs should fail, then shall the barriers between Tamriel and the Daedric realms fall, and Daedra-worshipers might summon lesser Daedra and undead spirits to trouble the races of men."

"Pelinal's Death\n"
"\n"
"And in the blood-floored throne room of White-Gold, the severed head of Pelinal spoke to the winged-bull, Morihaus, demigod lover of Al-Esh, saying, \"Our enemies have undone me, and spread my body into hiding. In mockery of divine purpose, the Ayleids cut me into eighths, for they are obsessed with this number.\"\n"
"\n"
"And Morihaus, confused, snorted through his ring, saying, \"Your crusades went beyond her counsel, Whitestrake, but I am a bull, and therefore reckless in my wit. I think I would go and gore our prisoners if you had left any alive. You are blood-made-glorious, uncle, and will come again, as fox animal or light. Cyrod is still ours.\"\n"
"\n"
"Then Pelinal spoke again for the last time: \"Beware, Morihaus, beware! With the foresight of death I know now that my foe yet lives, bitter knowledge to take to my grave. Better that I had died believing myself the victor. Although cast beyond the doors of night, he will return. Be vigilant! I can no longer shield the host of Men from Umaril's retribution.\"\n"

"Alessia's Youth During the Slave-Years\n"
"\n"
"Perrif's original tribe is unknown, but she grew up in Sard, anon Sardarvar Leed, where the Ayleids herded in men from across all the Niben: kothri, nede, al-gemha, men-of-'kreath (though these were later known to be imported from the North), keptu, men-of-ge (who were eventually destroyed when the Flower King Nilichi made great sacrifice to an insect god named ((lost))), al-hared, men-of-ket, others; but this was Cyrod, the heart of the imperatum saliache, where men knew no freedom, even to keep family, or choice of name except in secret, and so to their alien masters all of these designations were irrelevant.\n"
"\n"
"Men were given over to the lifting of stones, and the draining of the fields, and the upkeep of temple and road; or to become art-tortures for strange pleasures, as in the wailing wheels of Vindasel and the gut-gardens of Sercen; and flesh-sculpture, which was everywhere among the slaves of the Ayleids in those days; or, worse, the realms of the Fire King Hadhuul, where the begetting of drugs drawn from the admixture of daedrons into living hosts let one inhale new visions of torment, and children were set aflame for nighttime tiger sport.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Morihaus Explains Alessia's Names\n"
"\n"
"Then Morihaus said to them: \"In your tales you have many names for her: Al-Esh, given to her in awe, that when translated sounds like a redundancy, 'the high high,' from which come the more familiar corruptions: Aleshut, Esha, Alessia. You knew her as Paravant, given to her when crowned, 'first of its kind,' by which the gods meant a mortal worthy of the majesty that is killing-questing-healing, which is also Paraval, Pevesh, Perrethu, Perrif, and, in my case, for it is what I called her when we were lovers: Paravania.\n"

"\n"
"그리고 백금탑의 피바다가 된 왕실에서 펠리넬의 심하게 상처입은 얼굴이 날개돋은 황소 모리하우스, 반신의 연인 알-에쉬에게 입을 열었다. \"우리의 적들은 나를 끝장내지 못하자 내 몸을 조각내어 감추었다. 신성한 의도라는 조롱 아래서, 에일리드가 나를 여덟 토막으로 썰어냈어. 그들은 이 숫자에 집착하고 있으니까.\"\n"

"\n"
"그러자 펠리날은 마지막 순간을 위해 다시 말했다. \"조심하게, 모리하우스, 조심해. 죽음의 통찰력이 나를 깨닫게 하네, 내 적이 살아있어. 쓰라린 지식이 날 무덤으로 끌고 들어가는군. 내가 죽더라도, 내 자신이 승리자라 여겼다면, 그럴 수 있었다면 좋았을텐데... 어둠의 빗장 너머로 던져버려도.. 그 녀석은 돌아오고 말거야. 바짝 경계하라구! 나는... 이제 더 이상 우마릴의 응징으로부터 인류를 지킬 방패가 되어줄 순 없으니...\"\n"

"Former Imperial Librarian\n"
"\n"
"After the supposed theft of an Elder Scroll from our Imperial Library, I endeavored to find any sort of index or catalogue of the Scrolls in our possession so that such situations may be avoided (or at least properly verified) in the future. To my dismay, I discovered that the Moth Priests are notoriously inexact when it comes to the actual physical manifestations of the Scrolls, and had no idea how many they held, or how they were organized. Merely asking the question evoked chuckles, as if a child was asking why dogs cannot talk.\n"
"\n"
"I will confess, my jealousy of the ones who can read the Scrolls grows, but I am not yet willing to sacrifice my sight to alleged knowledge. The older Moth Priests I attempt to engage in conversation seem as batty as any other elder who has lost their mind, so I fail to see what wisdom is imparted from the reading.\n"
"\n"
"In any case, I set out to create my own index of the Elder Scrolls, in cooperation with the monks. Day by day, we went through the tower halls, with them telling me the general nature of each Elder Scroll so that I might record its location. Always careful never to glimpse the writings myself, I had only their word to go on. I meticulously drew out a map of the chambers, where Scrolls relating to various specific prophecies were located, where particular periods of history were housed. In all, it took nearly a year of plodding, but at last I had rough notes on the entirety of the library to begin my collation.\n"
"\n"
"It was here that things began to go amiss. In studying my notes, I found many areas of overlap and outright contradiction. In some cases different monks would claim the same scroll to be at opposite ends of the tower. I know they have no taste for jesting, or else I would suspect I was being made the fool in some game of theirs.\n"
"\n"
"I spoke to one of the older monks to relate my concerns, and he hung his head in sorrow for my wasted time. \"Did I not tell you,\" he coughed, \"when you started this that all efforts would be futile? The Scrolls do not exist in countable form.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I had thought you meant there were too many to be counted.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"There are, but that is not the least of their complexities. Turn to the repository behind you, and tell me how many Scrolls are locked therein.\"\n"
"\n"
"I ran my fingers over the metal casings, tallying each rounded edge that they encountered. I turned back. \"Fourteen,\" I said.\n"
"\n"
"\"Hand me the eighth one,\" he said, reaching out his hand.\n"
"\n"
"I guided the cylinder into his palm, and he gave a slight nod to acknowledge it. \"Now, count again.\"\n"
"\n"
"Humoring him, I again passed my hands over the Scrolls, but could not believe what I was feeling.\n"
"\n"
"\"Now … now there are eighteen!\" I gasped.\n"
"\n"
"The old monk chuckled, his cheeks pushing up his blindfold until it folded over itself. \"And in fact,\" he said, \"there always were.\"\n"
"\n"
"It was then that I enrolled as the oldest novice ever accepted into the Cult of the Ancestor Moth."

"There are many legendary gladiators who've made their names in the Blessed Crucible. Among them, Felhorn, Sanarel the Great, and Aleris the Shroud are known for their formidable combat prowess and fighting spirit. But others, like Josef the Intolerant, have become famous for other reasons.\n"
"\n"
"Let me first say that the Blessed Crucible of Skyrim features an amazing array of competitors, with combatants arriving from all over Tamriel to test their mettle. In this time of warring alliances, it's not just anywhere that an Altmer would drag a wounded Orc to safety, or where a Redguard would so readily step into an arrow's path for an Argonian, but the Blessed Crucible is one such place. In the Crucible, one's team is one's nation, and the struggle for the Brimstone Crown the national religion.\n"
"\n"
"However, there was one man, a young gladiator named Josef. He came from the Breton Lion Guard, and was fresh-faced, decent with a blade. None questioned that he was a healthy boy, ready to take the Crucible by storm. But Josef could never understand the social phenomenon of the Crucible, and trusted only other Bretons. He could not fathom the fact that gladiators must place their trust in their teams, not in gladiators of the same race.\n"
"\n"
"Said gladiator Oberelle, \"Our match began, and this Breton boy sent his Khajiiti team member sprawling to the ground. Then he looked me in the eye and blinked twice, slowly. 'Is he trying to wink?' whispered my ally, Doumant. We capitalized on their folly and beat the boy and the Khajiit unconscious. One must never refuse such strokes of fortune in the Blessed Crucible.\"\n"
"\n"
"As time passed, young Josef grew increasingly frustrated. He scoffed at suggestions to collaborate with gladiators of other races. His demeanor incensed the Crucible audience along with its competitors, and management loved him for it. \"We would print Josef's face on currency if we could. He is a boon to us,\" they said.\n"
"\n"
"The gladiators felt differently.\n"
"\n"
"Said Dalu the Dunmeri Blade, \"Josef told me he would never collaborate with a kwama farmer. And he hounded me every day for kwama eggs. He was certain that I had some, or could, by some miracle, produce them. I have never even tasted a kwama egg. I was born in Skyrim.\"\n"
"\n"
"Said Ethenen, the Rabid Dunmer, \"Josef repeatedly referred to me as Dalu.\"\n"
"\n"
"Said Azrukana, the Crimson Cat, \"I told him he could trust me in battle. That he needed to, if he wanted to live for much longer as a gladiator. He rasped his voice and said, 'This one thinks you should have some moon sugar and keep your opinions to yourself.' I did not like that.\"\n"
"\n"
"Said Inarfar, the Skyforged Razor, \"When Hrasvard, my comrade of a decade, was slain in combat, I went to the Hall of Champions and I wept. That Breton boy found me and said, 'Did you run out of mead-coin? I know how that feels, but unlike you Nords, I wouldn't cry about it.' The beating that ensued in Hrasvard's honor lasted eight minutes.\"\n"
"\n"
"No gladiator had gained as much infamy as Josef in so short a time, but he soon disappeared.\n"
"\n"
"His current whereabouts are unknown."

"\n"
"Building a fort in a swamp is no trivial task, but my men and I have accomplished it with Arx Corinium. It was a battle the entire duration—with insect-borne disease, with the wildlife of the marshlands, but the Empire wanted a foothold in this region and we provided one.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, as of this writing, we've packed our arms and armor on orders from Colonel Marianus, and prepare to leave our work behind. The Colonel cites the continued loss of a half-dozen soldiers every month in maintaining Arx Corinium as \"detrimental to the war effort.\" I agree, and would note that I predicted this outcome when we arrived over a year and a half ago. I said as much to the Colonel, who ordered that the project proceed. This isn't a statement of complaint, but of fact.\n"
"\n"
"Construction suffered numerous complications: the bog impeded our progress at every turn, and it became clear the initial foundation we built would sink after the first month. When we moved our location farther to the north, we met a fierce wamasu that cost me ten men to chase off the premises. After repeated encounters, our war wizard, Belisaro, named it Ganakton the Tempest, after the bolts of lightning that the beast emits from every orifice (\"Ganakton\" was the moniker of a hated aunt, rumored to possess Orcish blood).\n"
"\n"
"The dense humidity was another foe, turning our plate armor to steel barrels full of sweat during the early months of construction. It goes against regulation, but I allowed my soldiers the luxury of cloth armor during the summer. It was that or death from heatstroke. We would have been at a disadvantage had we come under attack, but any enemy marching towards Arx Corinium would be half-dead by the time they reached us. In any event, it never happened.\n"
"\n"
"Battle found us just the same: every beast in this swamp, large or small, is a walking death trap, and some days, we fought sword to stinger with insects the size of a grown man's head. Other days, our mages contended with the likes of Ganakton the Tempest, who continued to terrorize the fort. He razed the eastern wall a dozen times, and I regret that I will never be allowed the luxury of mounting his skull on my mantle. But if it means we finally get to leave, I'll gladly allow Ganakton his life.\n"
"\n"
"As I look back on this last year and a half, at the resources and manpower it took to construct Arx Corinium, I can't say it's been worth it. Again, this isn't a statement of grievance. I bear my superiors no ill will for my orders. However, I would note that I made several warnings in advance of this project, and have compiled copies of my letters to my immediate superior, Colonel Marianus, detailing the reasons why I believed the construction of Arx Corinium could prove a disastrous venture for the Empire.\n"
"\n"
"I want to clarify that this is not a declaration of failure on anyone's part, either for myself, my men, or Colonel Marianus. I am fully aware that that decision falls to Tribune Hilario, whom I encourage to read the letters I mention above. I've already sent word and made them available for any officer to peruse at the Imperial City military archives."

"Kynbriefing for the Lightless Oubliette\n"
"\n"
"If you've never served a shift in the Lightless Oubliette before, pay close attention, because this is not a place where you want to make a mistake. The L. O. was specifically constructed as a detention facility for captive servants of the Shining Bitch, and you know how our Dread Lord feels about her. If any of these Aurorans or Lustrants escape on your watch, you'll be lucky to get off with Second-Degree Gradual Discorporation.\n"
"\n"
"Now I don't care how well you know the Seven-Hundred-and-One Edicts; I don't care if you can quote chapter and verse from the Mandatory Codicils: the rules that matter in the Lightless Oubliette are the following. \n"
"\n"
"1.\tNo white or yellow glow crystals to be brought into the facility.\n"
"\n"
"This isn't because we like the place gloomy, fools. It's because the Prisoners can pervert certain spectra of light into working on their behalf. Stick to blue glow crystals for illumination, or even better, open flame. \n"
"\n"
"2.\tNo torment-sport with the Prisoners.\n"
"\n"
"That includes the Elf King. No, I don't know why, that's just the way it is. Rumor has it the Dread Lord is planning some kind of nasty surprise for the Shining Bitch, and to pull it off he needs her servants with their bodies intact. Could be true, I don't know. \n"
"\n"
"3.\tClean up after yourself. \n"
"\n"
"This is a top-security facility, so no Soul Shriven are allowed in, not even custodians. You make a mess, you clean it up. This includes any bodily fluids spilled during sparring practice—if I find stains on the flagstones again, somebody's next shift will be in the scathe-rings."

"Raw Materials for the Great Shackle:\n"
"\n"
"Supplies of ebony-alloy cold-iron are stable at 17,500 tons, but that's barely enough to forge the Shackle, given typical rate of loss in the casting process. It might be wise to send for another 2,000 tons from the mine burrows in the side of the Mountainous Corpse of the Iron Colossus. Better safe than sorry. \n"
"\n"
"I am honored to report that we have discovered the source of the depletion in the supplies of the Charcoal of Remorse: cinder-imps had been getting into the vault through a forgotten plasm-duct and gorging on the C of R. (We learned this when we found one so bloated it was unable to get back through the duct opening.) We sent in an explosive duct-worm, which found the nest and discorporated all the cinder-imps. Deficits in the supply of Charcoal of Remorse have been made up by increasing Torment Quotas on the Kothringi Soul Shriven.\n"
"\n"
"I don't wish to be one to point talons, but it is my duty to report that even if the Shackle is forged according to schedule, we will not be able to quench it if we do not receive our shipment of the Blood of a Thousand Innocents. We have gotten repeated assurances from Exsanguinator Thartantix that our shipment will be on its way \"any shift now,\" but so far all we've received are promises. I hesitate to elevate this to the Overkyn level, but I think it's high time the matter was looked into."

"By Kynval Zzedenkathik of Clan Deathbringer\n"
"\n"
"For as long as I can remember—and like all Dremora my memory is keen, especially for grievances—I have faithfully served the officers of my clan, and through them, My Lord Molag Bal. And yet not always: for once, to my shame, I was compelled to serve another. \n"
"\n"
"I was on guard duty at the Endless Stair, an assignment I always enjoy, for I can mock and torment the passing Soul Shriven without being held responsible for them meeting their quotas. Leaping out from behind a claw-pillar while shouting, \"There you are, weakling!\" just never loses its appeal.\n"
"\n"
"I was lurking behind a Dark Anchor chain link, preparing to terrify an approaching Soul Shriven by suddenly knocking her down and sneering, \"No match at all,\" when I suddenly felt a strange tingling all over, from my horns down to my toes. I grew dizzy as the plane spun around me, nearly fell into a pool of blue plasm, and then suddenly felt myself hurled into an endless black void. \n"
"\n"
"I wasn't alarmed at first, because who hasn't been hurled into an endless black void? It wasn't until I began to materialize at my destination and got a taste of the air that I had my first misgivings. \"I smell … weakness,\" I said to myself—and I couldn't have been more right. \n"
"\n"
"It was then that I first heard the voice of my Conjurer as he said, \"Ah, this one looks fairly robust,\" and the full horror of my situation broke upon me. For I had been summoned to do the bidding … of a mortal. \n"
"\n"
"I turned, aghast, to see who had dared summon me across the infinities to Nirn, and found myself faced with a tall Elf of Summerset. Oh, I recognized the type: I'd abused more than a few Altmeri Soul Shriven in my time, and with gusto, for they evince a haughty arrogance entirely inappropriate in mere mortals. This one gave me a brief, appraising look, and then turned away, saying, \"Follow and fight. There are Worm Cultists that need slaying.\"\n"
"\n"
"Worm Cultists. Can you imagine the ignominy, fellow kyn? Not only had I been conjured away from my duty by one of the hated Elven mortals, but I must serve him by slaying the minions of Mannimarco, our Dread Lord's lieutenant and viceroy-to-be! I tried to resist, flexing my indomitable will, but the mortal mage's binding spell was too strong—all I could do was say, \"No one escapes!\" and follow him past a pair of torches into a subterranean maze of tunnels. \n"
"\n"
"\"You serve the great Vanus Galerion, Dremora,\" my Conjurer announced, quite unnecessarily—for what need had I to know the name of my slavemaster? But then I reconsidered, and mentally added his name to that long list each of us keeps: the list labeled, \"Vengeance.\"\n"
"\n"
"I followed, not deigning to crouch when my Conjurer hunched over to sneak, merely glaring at him and thinking, \"I will feast upon your heart.\" In truth, however, it was as well that I had this Elf Vanus to follow, for the tunnels were many and twisting, and though we Dremora are fearless, relentless, and unparalleled among warriors throughout Oblivion, our sense of direction is rather poor. When doing courier duty, I've been known to lose my way right in the middle of the Moonless Walk and wind up back at the Lightless Oubliette where I started. \n"
"\n"
"In time this Vanus began to pause frequently, listening, which only increased my irritation and impatience. Finally he stopped, with a \"Shh!\" to me—which was completely unfair, as I hadn't said a word. But I realized why he'd stopped when I suddenly heard human speech from the tunnel ahead. Hesitating nary an instant, I drew my greatsword and rushed forward, crying \"A challenger is near!\" The Elf cursed and followed, but he had only himself to blame—I was following his orders exactly. \n"
"\n"
"The next minute passed in the red fury that all true Dremora feel when they enter battle. But my usual enjoyment of bloody slaughter was tainted by the knowledge that I was killing those my Dread Lord would prefer I didn't, and frankly, that just ruined the whole experience for me. As I lopped off the limbs and heads of the Worm Cultists, I was aware of the energies of the Elf's powerful magics crackling past me, incinerating the more distant enemies, but I was too mortified to enjoy the orgy of destruction. The Elf came striding up as I subdivided the final Worm Anchorite, gloating, \"So much for them. Take that, Mannimarco!\" \n"
"\n"
"\"There could be no other end,\" I replied sourly, then felt the strange tingling again as the conjuration that had brought me to Nirn began to weaken. As the bonds dissolved I took one menacing step toward the Elf, but then the plane spun around me again, and it was back into the endless black void. \n"
"\n"
"When I came to my senses I was lying in a pool of turquoise slime, looking up at the smiling face of my superior, Kynreeve Xalxorkig. \"So, Zzedenkathik,\" he snarled, \"straying from your post when on duty, eh? It's the scathe-rings for you, my lad!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"But, Kynreeve,\" I cried, leaping to attention, \"I couldn't help it! I was conjured, summoned to Nirn—by a mortal!\"\n"
"\n"
"Xalxorkig smiled even wider. \"And that'll be an extra shift scathing for telling such a hornless lie. Now march, Zzedenkathik,\" he shouted, thumping me with his truncheon. \"Left, right, left, right, left, right ….\"\n"
"\n"
"I hate it when Xalxorkig smiles. Kynreeve or not, his name's going on my list."

"By Doctor Rhythandius\n"
"\n"
"As a Doctor of Transliminal Mythomysticism, I have long been interested in the soul/body problem, the reformation of the Daedric body post-banishment, and the formation of the body around the essence commonly known as the \"vestige.\" Since our enforced relocation to Coldharbour, courtesy of Our Luminous Lady, I have had considerable opportunity to observe these processes first-hand, and am now in a position to confirm many hypotheses that, upon Mundus, were fated to remain mere conjecture. \n"
"\n"
"It has long been understood that a Daedra, who lacks the Anuic animus known as the \"soul,\" is not killed when its body is destroyed. A Daedra slain upon Mundus is merely \"banished\" back to its plane of origin, where its morphotype, or \"vestige,\" gradually forms a new body, so that eventually the Daedra lives again. (This happens as well when a Daedra is slain in its native Oblivion.)\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, we have long known from the Daedra themselves that their bodies are formed from the very stuff of chaos, the \"creatia\" of Oblivion, a shapeless but energetic material that accretes around a vestige until it conforms to the morphotype's inherent pattern. \n"
"\n"
"Back on Mundus I had naively envisioned this creatia as some sort of misty, amorphous material swirling in a void somewhere. After our arrival in Coldharbour, it was some time before I realized that its ubiquitous pools of blue slime, the substance we've come to call \"Azure Plasm,\" was in fact the form that creatia takes upon this plane. By extension, I reasoned that chaotic creatia takes a different but planar-appropriate form in every realm of Oblivion—and this theory was later confirmed for me by the rogue Xivilai known as the Sojourner, who has had direct experience of numerous planes of existence. \n"
"\n"
"In fact, it was the Sojourner who first introduced me to one of those secret grottoes where one can observe the process of plasm-accretion in action. (To find such grottoes, where Daedra are \"born,\" it is necessary only to observe the slow flow of the Azure Plasm and follow it to its destination—for plasm-accretion causes a slow drain on adjacent pools.) It was fascinating to watch a vestige gradually absorbing Azure Plasm and converting it from the general to specific, so that over time it slowly took on the size and shape of a hulking, reptilian daedroth. \n"
"\n"
"Then there are the poor slaves known as the Soul Shriven. Each is a mortal kidnapped from Mundus at the moment of death, his or her soul stolen by Molag Bal for some unthinkable purpose, and given in exchange the vestige that enables him or her to form a counterfeit body here in Coldharbour. But they are not native to Oblivion, so a Soul Shriven's body is a sad imitation of the body worn in life, suffering rapid wear and decay until it dies—a death that is no liberation, for its vestige only forms a body once again, over and over, ad infinitum ….\n"
"\n"
"Such are the facts. What follows is speculation, born of conversations with the Sojourner during his infrequent and unpredictable visits. His theory is that the Soul Shriven's bodies are flawed because they have lost the focusing principle of their Anuic souls, so their vestiges are imperfect patterns. I concurred that this was likely, and then proposed the theoretical possibility of a Soul Shriven who, despite having lost his or her soul, possessed some other intrinsic Anuic aspect. This shall-we-say \"paragon\" Soul Shriven would form an unflawed body in Coldharbour that was a perfect duplicate of the body worn in Mundus. In fact, if this paragon bore a sufficiently high Anuic valence, upon contact with Padomaic creatia its body would form almost instantaneously. \n"
"\n"
"The Sojourner scoffed at my theory, but seemed taken with the idea nonetheless. He went on to speculate that if such a thing were possible, it would probably occur in a situation where the Mundus was in existential jeopardy. In that case the Heart of Nirn would spontaneously generate such \"paragon\" individuals as a way of defending itself from destruction, in a manner analogous to the way the mortal body fights off infection. \n"
"\n"
"Ah, Sojourner—how I miss your stimulating conversation. Such flights of fantasy! And yet, given the wonders I've seen in my prolonged existence upon this plane, is anything really impossible?"

"(Author Unknown)\n"
"\n"
"There was, in those days, a city in the Heartland, Delodiil by name. And it was a city of pleasant promenades, of learned scholars, of meticulous artisans, and of lissome dancers. And also did Delodiil have warriors fierce and proud, who protected the promenades, and the scholars, and the artisans, and the dancers. And though the warriors were few, they were bold.\n"
"\n"
"Now the people of Delodiil worshiped many gods, for they were devout and held all the Divines in reverence. But above all others they did venerate the Lady of Light, building for Merid-Nunda a chapel of colored rays and beams, which was for glory like a piece of Aetherius brought down to the mortal world. And the people of Delodiil were proud thereon.\n"
"\n"
"But across the valley was another city, Abagarlas, which was to the darkness as Delodiil was to the light. Now Abagarlas had as many citizens as Delodiil, but few were dancers, artisans, and scholars, because most were warriors fierce and proud. These warriors were lended to other states and cities for the making of war in return for wealth. And thus did Abagarlas, in its own way, prosper.\n"
"\n"
"Now the King of Abagarlas saw the chapel of lights that was the pride of Delodiil, and he said, \"Is not Abagarlas as great a city as Delodiil? We shall have a great chapel of our own.\" And he decreed that much of the wealth of Abagarlas be spent in the building of a shrine to his own patron Divine, who was the Lord Mola Gbal. And the people of Abagarlas reared up a vast shrine to Mola Gbal, but they were but rude soldiers rather than artisans, and the shrine was misshapen, ill-colored, and burdensome to look upon. But it was, nonetheless, larger than Delodiil's chapel of lights, and thus the King of Abagarlas boasted that his city was greater therefore than Delodiil. But the people of Delodiil evinced no dismay, and went about their business as before. \n"
"\n"
"And this unconcern of the Delodiils ate a hole into the heart of the King of Abagarlas, and he was vexed unto madness. He sent soldiers to profane the small shrine to Merid-Nunda in Abagarlas, and then went to his vast shrine to Mola Gbal, where he swore a mighty oath. And slaying a family of visiting Delodiils on the altar, the King vowed that he would gather his army, march across the valley, and capture all the Delodiils, sacrificing them to Mola Gbal within the chapel of lights. \n"
"\n"
"And the King of Abagarlas mustered all his soldiers, and on a night in which the skies were lit by a furious racing aurora, he marched them across the valley to Delodiil. But when the King and his army arrived they found the land empty, for the city of Delodiil was gone, unto every brick! \n"
"\n"
"And the King thought he heard laughter in the lights in the skies, mirth that turned to shrieks of fear that came, not from above, but from back across the valley. In haste the King marched his soldiers back to his city, but when they arrived at Abagarlas, they found it utterly destroyed as if by scorching light. And of the families of the soldiers and the King, nothing could be found but their shadows burnt into the walls of the city. \n"
"\n"
"Thus Abagarlas. But of the fate of Delodiil, nothing more was known."

"By Phrastus of Elinhir\n"
"\n"
"Truly, the Tract of Merid-Nunda is one of the strangest and least understood works of mythohistory that has come down to us from the early First Era. It exists only in partial manuscript form, a single copy of which resides in the library of the Arcane University at the Imperial City. (Or at least it did, though since the Mages Guild was blamed for the disappearance of the Emperor Varen and driven out of Cyrodiil, I don't know what has become of their once-admirable library.) \n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, I was granted an opportunity to study the noted Tract in detail while the Guild was still in possession of it, and made a personal copy for myself so I could continue to unravel its mysteries once I'd returned to Elinhir. \n"
"\n"
"The problem of understanding the Tract of Merid-Nunda is twofold: First, the extant document is clearly part of a larger work, drawn from seemingly somewhere in the middle, and without the preceding and following portions of the work we have little context for the part that remains. Second, the Tract is written in a peculiar argot that employs Ayleid phrases in a late Nedic syntax, including many words of unknown origin that don't appear in any other source. \n"
"\n"
"However, working outward from fragments previously translated by Wenegrus Monhana and Herminia Cinna, I believe I can shed some new light on certain key passages in this mysterious manuscript. Our format shall be to provide the translation of each passage, followed by my interpretation of its meaning.\n"
"\n"
"\"… were known as the Nine Coruscations, who followed the parabolas that led away from Magnus. Merid-Nunda was of these Sisters, as was Mnemo-Li, as was Xero-Lyg, as was ….\"\n"
"\n"
"This appears to identify the \"Daedric Prince\" Meridia with the so-called Star-Orphans, those Anuic ur-entities that separated from Magnus when that Divine withdrew from the creation of the Aurbis. The best-known of these Star-Orphans is probably Mnemoli the Blue Star, who is associated with un-time events, and was said to be visible even in the daytime sky at the time of the Dragon Break. \n"
"\n"
"\"… thus we call upon Cenedelin to bind the earth, as we speak to Merid-Nunda regarding the light, for she is the scintilla that fears not darkness, and swims the waves of pull and spin ….\"\n"
"\n"
"For the Ayleids, of course, Light was one of the four elements of creation, and this passage seems to confirm that Meridia was the personification of Light to the Wild Elves. Though I am certain of this passage's translation, I confess the meaning of the final phrases eludes me.\n"
"\n"
"The next passage was quite difficult, but its translation adds an entirely new episode to our accounts of the Dawn Era:\n"
"\n"
"\"The Lords of the Chaos-Realms chided Merid-Nunda for her trespass and bade her return to Aurbis, claiming all existing spheres as their own. But Merid-Nunda formed of her substance a great drag-lens, and the light of Magnus was bent thereby. The rays [carved? focused?] a new sphere from the chaos, which Merid-Nunda, [laughing? sparkling?], did claim for her own.\"\n"
"\n"
"This appears to recount the origin of the Colored Rooms, as Meridia's Oblivion realm is known, seemingly formed directly out of the stuff of chaos by an act of divine will. \n"
"\n"
"And finally:\n"

"\n"
"A curious passage indeed. The \"dragon,\" of course, traditionally refers to the Divine we know as Akatosh, the God of Time. This seems to suggest that by traveling the \"rainbow road\" (a reference to the prismatic refraction of light?), Meridia can in some sense alter the rate at which time flows forward. \n"
"\n"
"Altering the \"speed\" of time? Is this merely an absurd conceit of the late Ayleid sorcerer-priests, or a genuine insight into the nature of one of the least-understood Daedric Princes? \n"

"This unit will begin occupation of Arenthia within a fortnight. To ensure our success in the operation, every soldier needs some knowledge of the city and its civilians. Go in unprepared, and you'll end up robbed blind or stuck full of Wood Elf arrows without knowing how or why. Having spent some years guarding caravans in transit from Arenthia to Skingrad, I can provide the information you need to avoid personal harm and unnecessary provocation of the citizenry.\n"
"\n"
"Don't be lulled into complacency by the familiar buildings; this city is nothing like home. Though some Colovian traders from north of the River Strid have settled here, they're outnumbered by the Wood Elves from the south and the Khajiit who roam in from the eastern savannas. In the past, the city's allegiance has changed as often as the wind, but the flimsy Khajiiti hovels and the Elves' temporary tree-shaping don't endure like the good Colovian stone from which most of the lasting structures are built.\n"
"\n"
"You'll encounter plenty of Wood Elves and Khajiit, so a general awareness of their customs and practices will prove useful. Wood Elves become unreasonably aggressive if they believe a plant or tree is in danger. If any trees need to be cleared, obtain permission from your superior and assemble an armed squad. Also, be aware that Wood Elves are fond of indulging in drink, and their normally irreverent tongues become even worse when soaked. A word of advice: do not engage in drinking contests with these Elves, no matter how they taunt you.\n"
"\n"
"Khajiit make up a sizable portion of the population, though few hold permanent residence here (or anywhere). These moon-worshipers drift in and out in bands, bringing their sugary liquors and garish fabrics to market. Exercise caution if you are approached by one of the pleasure-partners that often travel with these caravans. They are invariably thieves, and by the time you realize you've been picked clean, they'll be halfway back to Dune.\n"
"\n"
"On a related note, we've caught wind that a ring of skooma smugglers may be operating out of the city's shamefully disused Temple of the Divines. This is an affront to the Divines and will be investigated once our hold is established. We will clear out the scum if the rumors prove true, but there is to be absolutely no looting of the Temple. In time, we will restore it to its rightful glory.\n"
"\n"
"Your job is to make certain that our grip on Arenthia is ironclad. Enforce martial law and keep the peace as much as possible, but be swift to quell any potential disturbance. Remember, no culture can claim \"traditional\" ownership of this city; it belongs to the banner with the most troops on the ground, and that's going to be ours."

"\"I stifled my gasp at the Mer's impertinence, to even suggest that he would be worthy to fight with those of us who had trained so hard. To my surprise, the archpriest agreed, adding the name Taren Omathan to the roster at the beginners' level. I was eager to whisper the news to my fellow elite students, but my first bout was scheduled to begin in a few minutes' time.\n"
"\n"
"\"I fought eighteen competitions in a row, besting all. The crowd gathered in the arena knew of my prowess, and gave polite, unsurprised applause at the end of each fight. As much as I focused on my own battles, I could not help noticing that other competitions were receiving more and more attention in the arena. The spectators whispered among themselves, and more began drifting away to see something that was evidently more spectacular and unusual than my unbroken string of victories.\n"
"\n"
"\"One of the most important lessons we teach from the Two-Moons Dance is the lesson of rejecting one's vanity. I understood then the importance of achieving a personal synchronicity with one's body and mind, of rebuffing outside influences of no importance, but I admit I had not accepted the lesson in my heart. I knew I was good, but my pride was hurt.\n"
"\n"
"\"It came down to a contest of champions, and I was one of the two. When I saw who the other fighter would be, my mood turned from one of wounded dignity to complete disbelief. My adversary was the servant, Taren.\n"
"\n"
"\"It must be a joke, or some final philosophical test, I reasoned. Then I looked into the crowd, and saw anticipation of a great battle to come in every eye. We gave one another the sign of respect, I stiffly and he with great elegance and modesty. The fight began.\n"
"\n"
"\"Initially, I sought to end it quickly, still thinking that he was unworthy to be cleaning the arena, let alone fighting in it. In retrospect, I was being illogical, as I must have known he had bested as many students as I had to reach that final level. He offered simple counterblows to my attacks, and responded in kind. His style was expansive, encompassing sophisticated arcane foot play one moment and simple jabs and kicks the next. I tried assailments intended to dazzle, but his face never showed either fear or contempt of my abilities.\n"
"\n"
"\"The fight lasted a long time. I don't recall when I realized I was destined to lose, but when it ended, I was not surprised by the outcome. With a sense of unusual and true modesty, I bowed to him. But I could not resist asking him as we left the arena to the sound of thunderous applause how he had so secretly grown to become a Master.\n"
"\n"
"\"'I never had a choice to rise in the Temple,' Taren replied. 'Every day, I cleaned the training chambers of the elite classes and then the beginners'. So you see, I never had the misfortune to forget those early mistakes, lessons, and techniques while observing and learning the ways of the Masters.'\n"
"\n"
"\"He left Torval early the next morning to return to his homeland, and I never saw him again, though I've heard people say that he's become a priest and a teacher. I became a teacher as well, for children just beginning their training in the Two-Moons, as well as the elite. And I make certain to bring my best pupils to see the how the unlearned fight, so that they might never forget.\""

"The Temple of Two-Moons Dance in Torval has for many hundreds of years been the finest training ground in all Tamriel for warriors of foot and fist. The masters teach students of all ages from all parts of Tamriel the most ancient techniques and the most modern variations, and many a former pupil has graduated to great fame. I myself trained there, and as a young child I remember asking my first master, Zoaraym, which former student he felt had best learned the lessons of the Temple.\n"
"\n"
"\"I was not a teacher when I met this man, but a student myself,\" he said, smiling in reminiscence, his great wrinkled face becoming even more like the withered fruit of the bathrum tree. \"This was long ago, before your parents were born. For many years I had trained at the Temple, rising to study in more difficult and demanding classes taught by the wisest and most learned Masters of the Two-Moons Dance.\n"
"\n"
"\"Gi'Nanth, you will come to understand that the tempering of your body must attend the tempering of your mind, and there is a prescribed order of training we at the Temple have designed over the years in concordance with the way of Riddle'Thar. I had reached the highest level, where my power and skill were such that even by supernatural, magical means, few could ever best me in weaponless combat.\n"
"\n"
"\"There was a servant at the Temple at the time, a Dunmer a few years older than myself and those in my class. We had never noticed him but in passing over the years, for he would enter the training chambers quietly, clean for a few minutes' time, and leave without saying a word. Not that we would have listened if he spoke, so enwrapped were we in our exercises and lessons.\n"
"\n"
"\"When our last Master told some of us, myself included, that the time had come for us to leave the Temple or become teachers, there was a great festival of celebration. The Mane himself deigned to visit and observe our ceremony. As we were and are a temple of philosophy and combat, there were contests of debate and competitions in the Temple's war arena, not only among the elite few, but open to all students.\n"
"\n"
"\"On the first day of the festival, I was examining the gladiatorial roster to see who I would fight with first, when I heard a conversation behind me: the servants speaking to the archpriest of the Temple. It was the first time I heard the Dunmer's voice, and the first time I heard his name.\n"
"\n"
"\"'I understand you wish to rejoin your people's struggle in Morrowind, Taren,' the archpriest was saying. 'I am sorry to hear it. You have been an institution here for many, many years, and you will be missed. If there's anything I can do for you, please name it.'\n"
"\n"
"\"'Thank you for your kindness,' the Dunmer replied. 'I do have a request, but I fear you would be loath to grant it. Ever since I first came to the Temple, I have been watching the students learn, and practiced myself when my duties allowed for it. I know I am but a servant here, but I would be honored if you would allow me to compete in the war arena.'\n"

"This one brings you good news, my cats and kittens, tigers and tigresses—especially for everyone who loves moon-sugar! And that's all of us, isn't it, my lion-hearts, because admit it: nothing makes our tails twitch like a moon-sugar-glazed sweet roll!\n"
"\n"
"If you're like Rathuni, this one knows you were positively reeling last Sun's Dawn at Abbess Mizzi's song-paper, in which she reported that it's not just the vile drug skooma that's bad for you, but our beloved moon-sugar itself! She declared that over-consumption of the Queen of Sweets is responsible for anxiety, droop-ear, sudden weight gain, and even the panting quivers. Imagine!\n"
"\n"
"Her song-paper spread panic across the kitchens of cat-kind, as we all tried to find substitutes for moon-sugar molasses and granule loaves. Prices of moon-sugar-cane plummeted, while sorghum and sweet-beets suddenly vanished from the markets! Personally, this one was beside herself when she was tapped to provide the sweetcake provender for the Riverhold Mid Year festival. Somehow, the petit-paws just weren't the same. So mortifying!\n"
"\n"
"But I promised you good news, didn't I, litter-mates? And here it is: after simply months of alchemical research, generously sponsored by the Canefield Farmers' Alliance, this one is here to tell you of her complete inability to duplicate Abbess Mizzi's results. (One can only conclude that the abbess—who is getting on in her lives, poor dear—made an error in her calculations somewhere.) My research shows that consumption of moon-sugar in normal moderation does not generate any of the dire effects alleged in that scary Sun's Dawn song-paper. \n"
"\n"
"In fact—and here's the best part, though I fear the title of my song-paper has spoiled the surprise, hasn't it?—regular consumption of non-distilled moon-sugar derivatives is actually what gives a Khajiit the gloss in her fur! Yes, my lion-hearts: we can have the sweets we love, as well as shiny, split-end-free coats. (And no wonder my pelt was looking so dull lately!)\n"

"So there you have it, kitten darlings! Isn't it Rathuni-la who always brings you the catnip? You know it is, leopard-loves. This one will just leave you with a quick recipe for my clan mother's Moon-Sugar Biscuits. Here it is—and enjoy!\n"

"\n"
"A wife. A husband. A son or daughter. Mother or father, aunt or uncle: each of us has lost one or more of these. It has touched every family in Elsweyr, the dreadful epidemic, the terrible plague—the Knahaten Flu.\n"
"\n"
"It started in Senchal, on Sweet Street in the Black Keirgo slums, among the skooma-struck. At first the city elders dismissed it as a toxin in the goods, but then it spread to Dagi's Pride and Squint-Eye, and was reported from the docks in Alabaster as well. \n"
"\n"
"And suddenly, it was everywhere: Torval, Orcrest, Dune, Corinthe, and all points in between. The Winds of Khenarthi bore the coughing and retching to every ear. We seemed to be witnessing the Death of Cats on Nirn.\n"
"\n"
"Slowly, Elsweyr began to fight back against its doom. Clan Mother Mizaba-ko of Corinthe first identified how the flu spread from Khajiit to Khajiit. Rathuni-la Dawnwhisker, a Daughter of Azurah from Riverhold, distilled a sorghum-tea that mitigated the worst of the symptoms. Even I contributed, organizing the remnants of the Mane's Legion to maintain order and put this new knowledge to use. \n"
"\n"
"But it was not enough. Everywhere, Khajiit were dying, by the litter, by the pride, by the entire tribe. The Moon Bishops read the portents, and they were dire indeed.\n"
"\n"
"Then, past all expectation, help arrived from an unforeseen direction: over the western waves came the Elves of Summerset, bringing physicians, healers, desperately needed supplies.\n"
"\n"
"And one more thing: hope. Hope that Elsweyr would survive.\n"
"\n"
"At first, many Cats were suspicious. Never before had the haughty High Elves helped the Khajiiti—why now? But their canonreeves passed among us, as if unafraid of the flu, and explained: the Altmer did it not from friendship, but from policy. We needed their help now, and they would need our help later. Invaders were coming to southwest Tamriel, they said, and the High Elves could not repulse them without Khajiiti claws at their side. \n"
"\n"
"To fight against mutual enemies—ah, that was a logic we Cat-Folk could understand. So we accepted the aid of the High Elves, and their sly cousins the Wood Elves, and gradually the Knahaten Flu began to recede. And when Queen Ayrenn of Alinor proposed the alliance treaty of the Aldmeri Dominion, we took plume in claw and signed it. \n"
"\n"
"Now, fellow Khajiiti, we have been through the forges of torment, and with our new allies, we emerge stronger than ever. We welcome the chance to test blade and edge against these invaders, to spill their blood and take their bright objects.\n"

"For now is the time of the Dominion."

"By the Silver-Haired Shadow\n"
"\n"
"You don't need to know my real name—not sure I remember it anymore, anyhow. My auntie left me a shack on a hill south of the border. Never thought about it much, until I lifted Hrol's Golden Girdle from the Temple of the One. Suddenly life got real complicated, and I decided it was time to go claim my inheritance.\n"
"\n"
"Auntie—let's call her Auntie Alias, no point in telling you too much—was an Imperial Border Scout, part of the cohort stationed at Fort Sphinxmoth, in the hills between Elsweyr and northern Valenwood. In the late days of the Second Empire the job of the Border Scouts was to keep the quarrelsome locals in line so as not to interfere with trade. \"Free trade, by Aless,\" auntie would say, opening another bottle of Surilie Farms and winking. \"Lifeblood of the Empire!\"\n"
"\n"
"Now the Scouts couldn't stop every little cross-border vendetta, but they did prevent the Cats and the Runty Elves from engaging in wholesale slaughter, and kept the bandits off the road from Dune to Arenthia. Auntie liked the climate, so when she retired she bought this little plot, came down and put up her hut. It's bigger than it looks, by the way—goes way back into the hill, and you can bet auntie dug out a back door, just in case.\n"
"\n"
"By the time I got here, one dark night in Sun's Dusk, with the wound in my thigh leaking blood again after that wild ride on the stolen horse, the Border Scouts were long gone, and the Dawnmead Marches had returned to their natural state: just one law shy of anarchy. And that one law was the Law of Revenge.\n"
"\n"
"It was the Vinedusk Wood Elf tribe versus the Dakarn Khajiiti clan, and it was a near-continual war of cross-border raids and midnight murders. They took turns occupying the ruins of Fort Sphinxmoth, sending out bands to waylay merchant caravans, raid villages and towns, and pay off old scores. Neither side noticed me hiding in the old shack during daylight, and slipping from shadow to shadow around the Marches after dark. The place was a killing ground—I could hardly go five hundred paces without encountering a dead warrior, a half-empty cart, or a slain merchant. \n"
"\n"
"It was a looter's paradise. \n"
"\n"
"Ah, those were the good times. Too good to last, I suppose—eventually the Vinedusk bandits overreached and staged a raid on Arenthia itself, right about the time the Dakarn Cats tried to take over organized crime in Dune and the Thizzrini Arena. The respectable citizens on both sides of the border formed militias or hired mercenaries, swept the hills clean, and that was the end of brigandry in the Marches. The Vinedusk tribe actually reformed as a Bosmeri irregular unit, the \"Vinedusk Rangers\" (Ha!), while the surviving Dakarns became the nucleus of the Duneguard Outwalkers. The border settled back down, and the Lifeblood of the Empire resumed its flow.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, I was there to recognize opportunity when I saw it coming down the road from Dune, laden with trade goods. By the next Fredas I was in Bravil, looking up a few of my old contacts. Half a season later it was me and the newly-dubbed Murkwater Gang who were occupying good old Fort Sphinxmoth, digging out the barracks, sharpening our blades, and repairing the old traps. \n"

"When bent cats die, their souls are dragged down by Namiira into the Dark Behind the World, to serve the Heart of Lorkhaj until their tails are straight. \n"

"FULL:\n"
"These, then, become the Dancers in the Darks, where they whirl to no music but the beating of the Heart. Sometimes these dancers seep up through the cracks in Nirni to the moonlit world, and walk among us as if made of moonless night. Then we call them dro-m'Athra. And this is a name of fear.\n"
"\n"
"For a true cat to see a dro-m'Athra do the Bent Dance is to feel his tail twitch in time, and feel the pull of the Darks. As each twitch pulls the true cat further from the moons-light, the cat's shadow grows longer and more bent. And if the tide of the Darks grows greater than the tide of the Lights, the true cat is lost, and becomes a bent cat. \n"
"\n"
"Then comes the true peril, for a dro-m'Athra can twist out a bent cat's soul, and send it through the cracks to the Darks. Once it hears the beating of the Heart it, too, will dance bent. \n"

"It is hard to stop. One night all the villagers of Lohrn were found dancing the Bent Dance. Now we do not go there.\n"

"Warriors use the Way of Jone, which is to unsheathe the claws and strike the darkness until it is no more. And this way is a good way, for everyone who is strong of heart and claw can use it.\n"
"\n"
"Priests use the Way of Jode, which is to bathe the moonless dark in bright lunar light. And this way is a better way, for bent spirits thus banished do not return."

"When I was young, my parents brought me to the cave where the priests worshiped the nereids. They dedicated me to the temple, so that I might one day become a priest, too.\n"
"\n"
"There were only three other children in the temple when I was growing up. The others made fun of me until I was ten years old because one of my legs was shorter than the other and I had a limp. \n"
"\n"
"One day, we were running through the cave (something that was forbidden, but the priests often looked the other way, letting children be children) and I tripped and fell face down into the water. I hit my head and blacked out. The other children were far ahead of me already, so they didn't see.\n"
"\n"
"Later, the priests told me that one of the nereids had lifted me out of the water. I said I didn't remember that happening, but later on, I did recall the feeling of floating and also a kind of terror, like I had seen something I was not supposed to see, something that was too beautiful for mortal eyes.\n"
"\n"
"The priests instructed us in our relationship to the nereids. We were required to memorize the gifts of the nereids and repeat them back every day:\n"

"the sweetness of their singing,\n"

"When he comes of age, each child has a choice to stay and become a priest or to go into exile. After so many years living in the cave, I could not imagine another life, and so I chose the priesthood. But sometimes I long for sunlight and wonder where a different path might have taken me, and what sights I might have seen if I had chosen exile."

"Just like trees grow toward the sun and you can hear different birds singing when the moons are out than when they are not, every Wood Elf born in Valenwood (and indeed, nearly every one born outside of it) knows of the Green Pact.\n"
"\n"
"The Green Pact is the agreement between the Wood Elves and Y'ffre that has guided our existence from the beginning of the great story.\n"
"\n"
"Its rules are clear. Do not harm the forest. Do not eat anything made from plant life. Eat only meat. When you conquer your enemies, eat their flesh. Do not leave them to rot. Do not kill wastefully. Do not take on the shape of beasts. You are Wood Elves. Your form is sacred. \n"
"\n"
"This is the Green Pact. In exchange for keeping to this Pact, the forest, which we call the Green, has provided us with ample food and shelter. Y'ffre has given us the limited gift to ask the forest to shape itself to our needs. We have been amply blessed.\n"
"\n"
"But now, we find ourselves in a new situation. Our new allies—the High Elves and the Khajiit—do not hold to the Green Pact. They live in houses made of thatch and timber. They eat all manner of fruits and berries and drink wine made from grapes. They find the devouring of one's enemies barbaric. \n"
"\n"
"How are the Wood Elves of Valenwood to accommodate these new allies, while keeping to the Green Pact? It is a question that perplexes many Wood Elves today, especially in the newly-erected city of Marbruk. In the past, we have fought wars over lesser defilement of the Green.\n"
"\n"
"At the same time, we recognize that at the time of the Dominion's founding, the Green Lady and the Silvenar spoke on behalf of the Wood Elves and the Green Pact. We remember that we have a powerful mouthpiece in the Thalmor, Woodhearth's own Treethane Fariel.\n"
"\n"
"These are the leaders we should look to in this uncertain time. They have shown us through their actions an example which we can all follow. We must welcome these allies with true Wood Elf hospitality. We must not pick fights with them. We must try not to steal from them (many of them do not appreciate the rite of theft, but that is a subject for another essay). But at the same time, we should not shy away from speaking out in our own interests, and in that of the Green.\n"
"\n"
"Because of Treethane Fariel's powerful voice, much of the timber and all of the thatch for Marbruk was brought into Valenwood from other parts. For many the fact that so many trees had to be felled to clear space for the city is unforgivable, but Fariel saw that accommodating our allies is the first step to a strong defense of Valenwood against those who would surely destroy it. \n"

"Queen Ayrenn's willingness to listen is a sign of her wisdom and respect for the Wood Elf people. We should repay her by being willing to trust her leadership."

"This is a story the Wood Elves of Valenwood tell their children from a very young age.\n"
"\n"
"Once, there was nothing but formlessness. The land held no shape, the trees did not harden into timber and bark, and the Elves themselves shifted from form to form. This formlessness was called the Ooze.\n"
"\n"
"But Y'ffre took the Ooze and ordered it. First, she told of the Green, the forest and all the plant life in it. She gave the Green the power to shape itself as it willed, for it was her first tale. \n"
"\n"
"The Elves were Y'ffre's second tale. As Y'ffre spun the story, the Elves took the form they have today. Y'ffre gave them the power to tell stories, but warned them against trying to shape themselves or the Green. Shifting and the destruction of the forest were forbidden. \n"
"\n"
"Instead, Y'ffre commended the Wood Elves to the Green, so that they might ask the Green to provide them with shelter and a safe passage, and as long as they respected the Green, it would obey. This is called the Green Pact.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, Y'ffre told of all the beasts that crawl on the land or swim in the rivers or fly in the air. These, Y'ffre gave to the Wood Elves as sustenance. They were to eat no plants but consume only meat. Y'ffre also told that no Wood Elf who is struck down by another Wood Elf should be allowed to sink into the ground, but should instead be consumed, like the beasts. This is called the Meat Mandate.\n"
"\n"
"When the stories were told, Y'ffre saw that they had a pleasing shape, but some of the Ooze remained. Y'ffre told a final tale then, and gave purpose to the Ooze. \n"
"\n"
"Any Wood Elf that violated the Green Pact, either by shifting or by damaging the Green, would be condemned to return to the formlessness of the Ooze. Their names would be scrubbed from the story Y'ffre is telling and replaced with silence. \n"
"\n"
"The Wood Elves tell that those who are favored by the Green have the power to release the condemned from the Ooze, but where the condemned go and what form they take once they are released is unknown. \n"
"\n"
"No one has ever seen the Ooze, or heard the souls trapped in it, or met the one who can relieve the condemned of their punishment. But if you ask a Wood Elf if he thinks the Ooze is \"just a tale,\" he will invariably reply, \"There is no such thing as 'just a tale.'\""

"이 이야기는 아주 오랜 세월 전부터 발렌우드의 우드 엘프들이 아이들에게 해 주던 이야기이다.\n"
"\n"
"옛날 옛적에는 형태 없는 것들만이 존재했다. 땅은 모양을 갖추지 않았고, 나무는 줄기와 껍질로 굳어져 있지 않았으며, 엘프들은 이 형상, 저 형상으로 형태를 바꾸곤 했다. 이 형태 없는 세상은 개흙이라고 불렸다.\n"
"\n"
"하지만 이'프레가 개흙을 가져가서 명령을 내렸다. 우선 이'프레는 숲과 모든 살아있는 식물들이 존재하는 녹색을 이야기했다. 이'프레는 녹색에게 스스로를 자신의 의지대로 형성할 수 있는 힘을 주었고, 그것이 이'프레의 첫 번째 이야기였다.\n"
"\n"
"이'프레의 두 번째 이야기는 엘프들이었다. 이'프레가 이야기를 자아내자, 엘프들은 오늘날의 형상을 취하게 되었다. 이'프레는 엘프들에게 이야기를 말할 힘을 주었지만, 자신들이나 녹색의 형상을 바꾸려고 하면 안 된다고 경고했다. 변화와 숲의 파괴는 금지되었다.\n"
"\n"
"그 대신 이'프레는 우드 엘프들을 녹색에게 맡기어 주거지와 안전한 길을 제공받게 해 주었으며, 엘프들이 녹색을 존중하는 한 녹색도 엘프들을 따르도록 해 주었다. 이것은 녹색 조약이라고 불린다.\n"
"\n"
"마지막으로, 이'프레는 땅을 기어다니거나 강에서 헤엄치거나 하늘을 날아다니는 모든 짐승들을 이야기하였다. 이로써 이'프레는 우드 엘프들에게 생계를 이어나갈 양식을 주었다. 우드 엘프들은 식물을 먹지 못하고 고기만을 먹을 수 있었다. 또한 이'프레는 다른 우드 엘프의 손에 쓰러진 우드 엘프를 땅에 묻어서는 안 되며, 그 대신 짐승들처럼 쓰러진 우드 엘프를 먹어야 한다고 말했다. 이것은 고기의 명령이라고 불린다.\n"
"\n"
"이와 같은 이야기들을 들려줬을 때, 이'프레는 만물이 기쁘게 형태를 잡아가는 모습을 보았지만, 개흙의 일부는 여전히 남아 있었다. 그러자 이'프레는 마지막 이야기를 말하여 개흙에게 목적을 부여해 주었다.\n"
"\n"
"자신의 형상을 바꾸거나 녹색에게 피해를 주어 녹색 조약을 어긴 우드 엘프들은 개흙의 형태 없는 존재로 돌아가는 벌을 받게 되었다. 그들의 이름은 이'프레가 말해주는 이야기에서 지워져 침묵으로 대체될 것이었다.\n"
"\n"
"우드 엘프들에 따르면 녹색의 호의를 받은 사람에게는 개흙의 죄인들을 풀어줄 힘이 있다고 하지만, 풀려난 죄인들이 어디로 가는지, 그리고 풀려나면 어떤 형태를 취하는지에 대해서는 알려진 바가 없다.\n"

"개흙을 직접 목격해본 사람은 아무도 없다. 개흙에 갇힌 영혼과 이야기를 나눠본 사람이나 개흙의 죄인들을 풀어줄 수 있는 이를 만나본 사람도 없다. 하지만 우드 엘프에게 개흙이 \"그냥 이야기\"일 뿐 아니냐고 물어본다면, 그 우드 엘프는 언제나 이렇게 대답할 것이다. \"'그냥 이야기'일 뿐인 것은 아무것도 없답니다.\""

"\n"
"And Fadomai knew her time was near. Fadomai said:\n"
"\n"
"\"Ja-Kha'jay, to you Fadomai gives the Lattice, for what is steadier than the phases of the moons? Your eternal motions will protect us from Ahnurr's anger.\" And the moons left to take their place in the heavens. And Ahnurr growled and shook the Great Darkness, but he could not cross the Lattice.\n"
"\n"
"And Fadomai said:\n"
"\n"
"\"Nirni, to you Fadomai leaves her greatest gift. You will give birth to many people as Fadomai gave birth today.\" When Nirni saw that Azurah had nothing, Nirni left smiling.\n"
"\n"
"And all Fadomai's children left except Azurah. And Fadomai said, \"To you, my favored daughter, Fadomai leaves her greatest gift. To you Fadomai leaves her secrets.\" And Fadomai told her favored daughter three things.\n"
"\n"
"And Fadomai said, \"When Nirni is filled with her children, take one of them and change them. Make the fastest, cleverest, most beautiful people, and call them Khajiit.\"\n"
"\n"
"And Fadomai said, \"The Khajiit must be the best climbers, for if Masser and Secunda fail, they must climb Khenarthi's breath to set the moons back in their courses.\"\n"
"\n"
"And Fadomai said, \"The Khajiit must be the best deceivers, for they must always hide their nature from the children of Ahnurr.\"\n"
"\n"
"And Fadomai said, \"The Khajiit must be the best survivors, for Nirni will be jealous, and she will make the sands harsh and the forests unforgiving, and the Khajiit will always be hungry and at war with Nirni.\"\n"
"\n"
"And with these words, Fadomai died.\n"
"\n"
"After many phases, Nirni came to Lorkhaj and said, \"Lorkhaj, Fadomai told me to give birth to many children, but there is no place for them.\"\n"
"\n"
"And Lorkhaj said, \"Lorkhaj makes a place for children and Lorkhaj puts you there so you can give birth.\" But the Heart of Lorkhaj was filled with the Great Darkness, and Lorkhaj tricked his siblings so that they were forced into this new place with Nirni. And many of Fadomai's children escaped and became the stars. And many of Fadomai's children died to make Nirni's path stable. And the survivors stayed and punished Lorkhaj.\n"
"\n"
"The children of Fadomai tore out the Heart of Lorkhaj and hid it deep within Nirni. And they said, \"We curse you, noisy Lorkhaj, to walk Nirni for many phases.\"\n"
"\n"
"But Nirni soon forgave Lorkhaj for Nirni could make children. And she filled herself with children, but cried because her favorite children, the forest people, did not know their shape.\n"
"\n"
"And Azurah came to her and said, \"Poor Nirni, stop your tears. Azurah makes for you a gift of a new people.\" Nirni stopped weeping, and Azurah spoke the First Secret to the Moons and they parted and let Azurah pass. And Azurah took some forest people who were torn between man and beast, and she placed them in the best deserts and forests on Nirni. And Azurah in her wisdom made them of many shapes, one for every purpose. And Azurah named them Khajiit and told them her Second Secret and taught them the value of secrets. And Azurah bound the new Khajiit to the Lunar Lattice, as is proper for Nirni's secret defenders. Then Azurah spoke the Third Secret, and the Moons shone down on the marshes and their light became sugar.\n"
"\n"
"But Y'ffer heard the First Secret and snuck in behind Azurah. And Y'ffer could not appreciate secrets, and he told Nirni of Azurah's trick. So Nirni made the deserts hot and the sands biting. And Nirni made the forests wet and filled with poisons. And Nirni thanked Y'ffer and let him change the forest people also. And Y'ffer did not have Azurah's subtle wisdom, so Y'ffer made the forest people Elves always and never beasts. And Y'ffer named them Bosmer. And from that moment they were no longer in the same litter as the Khajiit.\n"
"\n"
"And because Y'ffer had no appreciation for secrets, he shouted the First Secret across all the heavens with his last breath so that all of Fadomai's children could cross the Lattice. But Azurah, in her wisdom, closed the ears of angry Ahnurr and noisy Lorkhaj so they alone did not hear the word."

"\n"
"그리고 파도마이가 말했다.\n"
"\n"
"\"너니, 너에게 파도마이가 그녀의 가장 큰 선물을 남겨 주마. 너는 파도마이가 오늘 그랬듯이 수많은 종족들에게 생명을 줄 것이다.\" 아주라는 아무것도 받지 못한 것을 너니가 보았을 때, 너니는 미소를 남겨 주었다.\n"
"\n"
"그리고 아주라를 제외한 파도마이의 아이들은 모두 떠났다. 파도마이가 말하길, \"내 사랑하는 딸아, 파도마이는 너에게 그녀의 가장 큰 선물을 남겨 주마. 너에게 파도마이가 그녀의 비밀들을 남겨 주마.\" 그리고 파도마이는 그녀의 사랑하던 딸에게 세 가지를 말해 주었다.\n"

"그리고 파도마이가 말하길, \"너니가 그녀의 자식들로 가득 찼을 때, 그 중 하나를 골라 바꾸어라. 가장 빠르고, 가장 똑똑하고, 가장 아름다운 민족으로, 그리고 카짓이라 이름지어라.\"\n"
"\n"
"그리고 파도마이가 말하길, \"카짓은 최고의 등반가여야 한다. 매서와 세쿤다가 떨어진다면, 케나티의 숨결을 타고 달들을 원래대로 돌려놓아야 하기 때문이다.\"\n"
"\n"
"그리고 파도마이가 말하길, \"카짓은 최고의 기만자여야 한다. 아누르의 자식들로부터 천성을 드러내지 말아야 하기 때문이다.\"\n"

"\n"
"이 말을 남기고, 파도마이는 눈을 감았다.\n"
"\n"
"많은 위상이 흐른 후, 너니는 로카즈에게 가서 말했다. \"로카즈, 파도마이께서는 내게 많은 후손들에게 삶을 주라고 하셨는데, 그들이 살만한 곳이 없다.\"\n"
"\n"
"그러자 로카즈가 말했다. \"로카즈가 후손들이 살 곳을 만들어 주겠다. 그리고 로카즈가 너를 그곳에 보내 네가 후손들을 낳게 해 주겠다.\" 그러나 로칸의 심장은 거대한 어둠으로 가득 차 있었고, 형제자매들을 속여 너니와 후손들을 강제로 그 새로운 장소에 가두려 했다. 그러자 파도마이의 많은 후손들이 도망쳐서 별이 되었다. 또한 많은 파도마이의 후손들이 너니의 길을 안정시키기 위해 죽어야 했다. 그러자 생존자들은 단결하여 로카즈를 응징했다.\n"

"\n"
"그러나 너니는 로카즈를 금방 용서했는데, 그것은 새로운 후손을 만들기 위해서였다. 그녀는 아이를 잉태한 것을 느꼈지만, 바로 그 총애하는 아이들, 숲의 민족 때문에 울었는데, 그들의 형상을 알지 못하였기 때문이었다.\n"
"\n"
"그러자 아주라가 그녀에게 와서 말했다. \"불쌍한 너니, 눈물을 거두어라. 아주라가 너의 새로운 민족에게 선물을 내려주겠다.\" 너니는 울음을 멈추었고, 아주라는 달들에게 첫 번째 비밀을 알려주었으며, 달들은 곧 갈라져서 아주라를 인도하게 되었다. 그리고 아주라는 사람과 짐승 사이에서 갈피를 잡지 못하던 숲의 민족을 몇 명 골라 너니가 지닌 가장 좋은 숲과 사막에 정착시켰다. 그리고 지혜로운 아주라는 그들을 다양한 형상으로 만들어 한 민족이 모든 목적을 이룰 수 있게 하였다. 아주라는 그들을 카짓이라 이름 붙이고 두 번째 비밀을 말해주었으며 비밀의 가치를 가르쳤다. 그리고 아주라는 이 새로운 카짓 민족을 달의 격자틀에 묶어두어 너니의 숨겨진 방어자 역할에 적합하도록 만들었다. 그 다음 아주라가 세 번째 비밀을 말하니, 달들이 습지에 환하게 비추었고 그 빛은 설탕이 되었다.\n"
"\n"
"그러나 이'페르가 아주라의 뒤에 숨어 첫 번째 비밀을 엿듣고 말았다. 그리고 이'페르는 비밀을 좋아하지 않았기에, 너니에게 아주라의 속임수를 일러바쳤다. 그러자 너니는 사막을 뜨겁게 달구고 모래를 거칠게 만들었으며, 숲을 축축하게 만들고 독으로 가득 채워 버렸다. 그리고 너니는 이'페르에게 감사를 표하고 그가 숲의 민족도 바꿀 수 있게 해 주었다. 하지만 이'페르에게는 아주라의 절묘한 지혜가 없었고, 그 때문에 이'페르는 숲의 민족 엘프들을 언제나 짐승이 될 수 있으며 절대로 짐승이 될 수 없게 만들었다. 그리고 이'페르는 그들을 보스머라 이름붙였다. 그때부터 숲의 민족은 더 이상 카짓과 같은 배에서 나온 형제가 아니게 되었다.\n"
"\n"
"그리고 이'페르는 비밀을 좋아하지 않았기에 첫 번째 비밀을 마지막 숨결에 실어 온 창공에 퍼트렸고, 그 소리는 모든 파도마이의 후손들이 세상의 격자틀을 넘어설 수 있게 해주었다. 그러나 지혜로운 아주라가 분노한 아누르와 요란한 로칸의 귀를 막아버렸기에 그들만은 이'페르의 말을 듣지 못했다."

"\n"
"And they gave birth to Alkosh, the First Cat. And Ahnurr said, \"Alkosh, we give you Time, for what is as fast or as slow as a cat?\"\n"

"And they gave birth to Khenarthi, the Winds. \"Khenarthi, to you we give the sky, for what can fly higher than the wind?\"\n"

"\"Hermorah, you are the Tides, for who can say whether the moons predict the tides or the tides predict the moons?\"\n"

"\n"
"But Khenarthi went to Fadomai and said, \"Fadomai-mother, Khenarthi grows lonely so high above the world where not even my brother Alkosh can fly.\" Fadomai took pity on her and tricked Ahnurr to make her pregnant again.\n"

"And Fadomai gave birth to the Moons and their Motions. And she gave birth to Nirni, the majestic sands and lush forests. And she gave birth to Azurah, the dusk and the dawn.\n"

"\n"
"Though Wood Orcs prize strength and honor and above all else, their interpretation of what those things mean separates them from their northern, Orsinium cousins. For instance, having strength to a Wood Orc means having agility and mobility as much as it does muscular power and endurance. I would like to hear an Orsinium Orc's take on the topic, but I imagine that, if one considers an Orsinium Orc as formed like a member of a heavy infantry regiment, then a Wood Orc is like a light skirmisher in the same army.\n"
"\n"
"The Wood Orcs, like the Bosmer, also flourish in forested areas. They've made no Pact with the Green—by my bow, they have utter disregard for and a lack of knowledge of the Green Pact—but I wouldn't be surprised if they stood in Y'ffre's favor in some way, with the ease I've seen them navigate tree-laden regions.\n"
"\n"
"Why worry about this? I've had Wood Orcs on the mind lately—it's difficult not to when one has been among them, as I have. I was ordered through their territory by a local Battlereeve to deliver a message—was told it would be easy to avoid detection. But Wood Orcs are a very different breed of Orc, as I've detailed above. When they caught me—no one save a Bosmer ever catches me—they noticed my presence in the trees above, though I suspect they must have been wary of something in their forest for days. I was ready, though, and felled two of the trio who turned on me with the same arrow.\n"
"\n"
"I was taken aback—I had expected to fell three. But the last one—inexplicably, and in a most un-Orcish fashion—bolted out of the way, like lightning. I leapt, rolled to the ground, just as a curved hand-axe whirled into the trees, through the space where my heart would have been. I came to my feet with dagger ready, and parried a blow from a second handaxe that nearly shook the knife from my hand. The Wood Orc growled and swung again, and in that moment, I couldn't have told him from his Orsinium cousins. He fought with the agility and grace of my people, mixed with the honorbound fury of the northern Orcs. He managed to tear a deep wound in my side, as I tossed a handful of dirt into his eyes. Half-blinded by pain myself, I stumbled to relative safety in the darkness of the woods as he cursed and spat, called me a \"coward who disguised himself with the forest instead of fighting with it.\"\n"
"\n"
"Hircine must have walked with me that day, for I was sure that battle was lost. The Wood Orc fought too fiercely, knew his own forest too well. But he never did manage to find me again. I would welcome a second contest—but in Bosmer territory."

"오크들은 이상하다.\n"
"\n"
"오크들은 영리하지 못하고, 야수 같으며, 모든 면에서 단순하다. 분명히 개인마다 차이는 있겠지만, 보스머가 오크들에게서 언제나 찾아볼 수 있는 것들이 몇 가지 존재한다. 우리 문화로 완전히 이해할 수 있는 것은 하나도 없지만 말이다.\n"
"\n"
"저 우드 오크 친구들은 여전히 낯선 존재이지만, 그건 다른 이유가 있다. 저들은 아이러니하게도 보스머와 더 많은 공통점을 가지고 있으며, 주로 발렌우드에 기반을 두고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"우드 오크들이 힘과 명예를 가장 중요하게 여기긴 하지만, 그것들을 해석하는 방법은 북쪽에 있는 저들의 오시니움 사촌들과는 다른다. 예를 들자면, 우드 오크에게 있어서 힘을 가진다는 것은 근육의 힘과 인내심에 못지 않게 민첩함과 기민함을 가지는 것을 뜻한다. 언젠가 오시니움의 오크와 이 주제에 대해 대화해 볼 기회가 있었으면 좋겠지만, 아무튼 내 생각으로는 오시니움 오크가 군대의 중갑보병과도 같은 특징을 갖춘 반면, 우드 오크는 날랜 척후병과 같은 특징을 가졌을 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"우드 오크들은 보스머와 마찬가지로 숲으로 뒤덮인 지역에서 번성하고 있다. 저들은 녹색과 맹약을 맺지는 않았다(내 활에 대고 맹세컨대, 저들은 녹색 맹약에 대해 아는 것이 별로 없으며 아예 관심조차 없다). 하지만 저들이 이'프레의 호의를 어떻게든 대체했다 한들 난 놀라지 않을 것이다. 저들이 나무가 가득한 지역을 손쉽게 탐색하는 모습을 본 적이 있기 때문이다.\n"
"\n"
"왜 이것을 걱정해야 하는가? 나는 최근에 우드 오크들을 조심하던 적이 있었다(나처럼 우드 오크들 사이에 있게 된다면 그러지 않는 것이 어려울 것이다. 난 현지의 전투행정관에게 저들의 영역을 통과하여 전갈을 전달하라는 명령을 받았었다). 듣기로는 발견되지 않고 쉽게 지나갈 수 있다는 것이었다. 하지만 우드 오크들은 내가 위에서 자세히 설명했듯이 오크와는 아주 다른 종류들이다. 내가 붙잡혔을 때(나는 보스머 이외의 종족에겐 잡혀본 적이 없었다), 그들은 나무 위에 있었던 내 존재를 알아차렸다. 그들이 숲 속에서 며칠에 걸쳐서 뭔가를 경계하고 있었던 것 같기는 하지만 말이다. 그래도 난 준비를 했고, 날 눈치챈 삼인조 중에서 둘을 화살 하나로 쓰러뜨렸다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 깜짝 놀랐다. 셋을 쓰러뜨렸을 거라고 생각했기 때문이었다. 하지만 나머지 하나(이유는 모르지만, 가장 오크답지 않은 옷차림을 한 자였다)는 마치 번개처럼 뛰쳐나왔다. 나는 펄쩍 뛰어올라 땅바닥에 굴렀고, 그 직후에 약간 굽은 형태의 손도끼가 내 심장이 있었던 곳을 통과해 날아갔다. 나는 발에서 단검을 뽑아들었고, 두 번째로 날아온 손도끼를 쳐냈다. 거의 손에서 단검이 흔들릴 정도였다. 그 우드 오크는 으르렁대며 다시 손도끼를 던졌고, 바로 그 순간, 나는 그에게서 우드 오크들의 오시니움 사촌들과 닮은 점을 전혀 찾아볼 수가 없었다. 그는 우리 민족의 우아함과 민첩함을 북부 오크들의 명예로운 분노와 섞어서 싸웠다. 그는 간신히 내 옆구리에 깊은 상처를 낼 수 있었고, 난 그의 눈에 한 줌의 흙을 던졌다. 나는 고통 때문에 반쯤 장님 신세가 된 채로 비교적 안전한 숲 속의 어둠으로 비틀거리며 들어갔고, 그 우드 오크는 날 \"숲과 함께 싸우는 대신 자신을 숨기는 겁쟁이\"라고 부르며 침을 뱉었다.\n"
"\n"
"그 날은 허씬께서 나와 함께하셨던 것이 틀림없다. 그 싸움은 명백하게 진 싸움이었기 때문이다. 그 우드 오크는 너무나도 맹렬하게 싸웠으며, 자신의 숲을 너무나도 잘 알고 있었다. 하지만 그는 결코 날 다시 찾아내려고는 하지 않았다. 두 번째 싸움이 성사된다면 환영할 생각이다. 보스머 영역에서라면 말이다."

"by Afwa, a Student and Friend\n"
"\n"
"Necromancy's known to many as a binding of souls to a form prepared—or in some cases, manufactured—by the conjurer.\n"
"\n"
"While technically accurate, the implication is that souls bound in this manner are imprisoned against their will with no hope of release.\n"
"\n"
"Further implied is the idea that souls occupying the construct are always sentient—the souls of men or mer—a fallacy perpetuated by the practice of animating corpses for martial or manual labors.\n"
"\n"
"It is this misunderstanding and a potential for abuse that led to the vilification of necromancy and the expulsion of Mannimarco and his peers from the Isle of Artaeum.\n"
"\n"
"Enter Vastarie, a student of the Psijic Order and contemporary of such notables as Vanus Galerion and Mannimarco.\n"
"\n"
"While Mannimarco sought power through the direct application of necromantic energies, Vastarie's purposes were far more esoteric. She sought a way to delay the release of a sentient soul upon death that it might be consulted, its knowledge recorded for the ages.\n"
"\n"
"It is to this end that she worked with Mannimarco after leaving Artaeum, searching for a way to trap souls as one might capture lesser Daedra.\n"
"\n"
"Believing the secret lay with Molag Bal, the two conspired to enter Coldharbour and wrest it from the father of vampires himself. Together, they hatched a plan.\n"
"\n"
"With a brash courage known only to the young, Mannimarco and his followers held open a portal to the Prince's realm. Ever thirsting for adventure, it was Vastarie who entered its depths and returned with a cache of black crystals the likes of which they had never seen.\n"
"\n"
"To Mannimarco, they were perfect. Small, capable of containing even the most willful of souls, and apparently indestructible. To Vastarie, they were deeply flawed, for enchantment was the only safe way to free a soul from their depths.\n"
"\n"
"Even so, she set about the task of reproducing the stones, breaking them down, testing them with a variety of substances until, by happy accident, she created something new: the first Sigil Geode.\n"
"\n"
"Clear as crystal, this new device was capable of holding sentient souls within its depths, but unlike the gems wrested from the Lord of Domination, it was exceptionally fragile and would only hold its charge for a matter of days.\n"
"\n"
"Once imprisoned, souls could be transferred between geodes, but applying them as one would a soul gem effected a soul's release, instead.\n"
"\n"
"Vastarie had found what she was looking for, but Mannimarco was furious. What use was a soul gem that could not be used to fuel an enchantment? He demanded Vastarie find a way to modify her creation to his purposes.\n"
"\n"
"Realizing her friend would never stop searching, and that further discoveries made with him would only advance his goals, she gathered up her research and left with Telacar, her husband and a powerful necromancer in his own right.\n"
"\n"
"Together, they fled Mannimarco's grasp, eventually hiding in an Ayleid ruin deep within Valenwood. There, they lived for many years, as quietly as they could while perfecting their art. For decades, they had each other and seemed happy—until the day Vastarie left.\n"
"\n"
"In the years that followed, she wandered the surface of Nirn, exploring places of power. She visited Wayrest, Alik'r, the Crystal Tower, and the libraries of Dune, searching for some answer to a question that gnawed at her very soul.\n"
"\n"
"In time, she found what she was looking for and returned to Valenwood. There, she built a tower and took on apprentices, teaching them her particular brand of necromancy and furthering her research.\n"
"\n"
"Using her Sigil Geodes, we bound the souls of lesser Daedra, postponing their return to Oblivion as one might with a soul gem. We then worked on a way to manifest the trapped spirit into the world.\n"
"\n"
"Early attempts had unexpected, even dangerous results. Geodes shattered, sending shards of broken crystal into the flesh of our fellow students—misapplied energies bound the souls of the living into the tiny stones—but as we studied we corrected our mistakes and refined the process.\n"
"\n"
"Eventually, Vastarie had it down to a science. By applying a Sigil Geode at the moment of death, a soul could be suspended within its depths. Through applied conjuration, it could be drawn into an ectoplasmic shell where it could be consulted at leisure.\n"
"\n"
"She wrote the foundling Mages Guild of her discovery. Vanus Galerion himself came to witness her demonstration, which involved consulting an old groundskeeper who had volunteered to demonstrate the process.\n"
"\n"
"He was horrified when she bound the soul into her apparatus, and when the process was completed, with the old groundskeeper was released and allowed to return to Aetherius, he was white as a sheet.\n"
"\n"
"Slowly, he stood to address the assembled students. He spoke with vindictiveness and an anger none would expect from his unassuming mien. When he was finished, he turned and left.\n"
"\n"
"Some followed him. None could blame them, he wasn't wrong—the Sigil Geode was a dangerous creation. Misused, it could spark wars and bring about destruction unheard of in our history.\n"
"\n"
"Vastarie was undeterred, convinced that Galerion's willful ignorance would lead to his undoing, but something else would gain her attention in the years to come. A vast ruin was discovered beneath her tower's foundation, concealed from sight and scrying by the power of a Daedric Prince.\n"
"\n"
"In time, she walked into those ruins and never came out. Some of us still await her return."

"많은 이들이 강령술을 소환마법사가 준비해놓은 형체(아니면 이따금 제작해놓은 형체)에 영혼을 속박하는 기술이라고 알고 있다. \n"
"\n"
"기술적으로 더 정확하게 따져 본다면, 그런 방식으로 묶인 영혼들은 풀려날 희망 없이 자신들의 의지에 반한 채로 속박된다는 것을 암시한다.\n"
"\n"
"더 강하게 암시되는 사실은, 구성체에 자리잡은 영혼들이 언제나 지각을 가진 인간이나 머의 영혼이라는 잘못된 생각이 전쟁이나 육체 노동을 위해 시체를 일으켜 세우는 과정에 의해 고착화된다는 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"이런 오해와 오용에 대한 가능성 때문에 강령술에 대한 비방이 일어났으며, 매니마코와 그의 동료들은 아테움 섬에서 추방되었다.\n"
"\n"
"바스타리에 대해서 서술하자면, 그녀는 시직 결사의 학생이었으며 그 유명한 바누스 갈레리온, 그리고 매니마코와 같은 시대를 살았던 사람이다.\n"
"\n"
"매니마코가 강령술적인 힘을 응용하여 힘을 추구하였다면, 바스타리는 더욱 난해한 목적을 가지고 있었다. 그녀는 지각 있는 영혼이 죽음을 맞았을 때 일어나는 영혼의 풀려남을 지연시킬 방법을 탐구하였으며, 그 영혼과 소통하여 그 지식을 기록하여 후세에 남기고자 하였다.\n"
"\n"
"바로 그렇기 때문에 그녀는 아테움을 떠난 뒤 매니마코와 함께 일하며 하급 데이드라의 영혼을 가두는 방법을 탐구했다.\n"
"\n"
"몰라그 발이 비밀을 숨기고 있다고 믿은 둘은 콜드하버에 들어간 다음 뱀파이어의 아버지 본인에게서 그 비밀을 빼내려 공모했다. 그들은 함께 계획을 세웠다.\n"
"\n"
"젊은이들만이 가질 수 있는 무모한 용기를 가지고, 매니마코와 그의 추종자들은 군주의 영역으로 통하는 포탈을 열었다. 그 누구보다도 모험에 목말라했던 바스타리는 콜드하버 깊숙한 곳까지 들어가 한번도 본 적 없었던 검은 수정체같은 물건들을 가지고 돌아왔다.\n"
"\n"
"그것들은 매니마코에게 있어서 완벽한 물건이었다. 크기는 작지만 가장 강한 영혼마저도 담을 수 있었으며, 파괴할 수도 없어 보였기 때문이다. 바스타리에게 있어서는 큰 결함이 있는 물건이었는데, 수정체 깊은 곳으로부터 안전하게 영혼을 해방시킬 방법은 마법부여가 유일했기 때문이었다.\n"
"\n"
"그렇기는 하지만, 바스타리는 그 돌을 재현해내고, 부숴보고, 다양한 본질로 실험해보는 작업에 착수했다. 행복한 우연으로 인해, 그녀는 뭔가 새로운 것을 만들어냈다. 바로 첫 번째 인장 정동석이었다.\n"
"\n"
"수정체만큼이나 투명한 이 새로운 고안품은 그 깊숙한 곳에 지적인 영혼을 담을 수 있었지만, 지배의 군주가 왜곡시킨 보석들과는 다르게 유난히 손상되기 쉬웠으며 그 힘도 며칠 동안만 유지할 수 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"영혼이 한번 속박되면 그 영혼을 정동석들 사이로 전송시킬 수 있었지만, 같은 방식을 소울젬에 적용시키면 영혼은 전송되는 대신 풀려나버렸다.\n"
"\n"
"바스타리는 자신이 찾던 것을 발견했지만, 매니마코는 몹시 분노했다. 마법부여에 사용할 수 없는 소울젬이 무슨 소용이란 말인가? 매니마코는 바스타리에게 그녀의 창조물을 자신의 목적에 맞도록 변경시킬 방법을 찾으라고 요구했다.\n"
"\n"
"자신의 친구가 탐구를 절대 멈추지 않을 것이며, 더 이상의 발견이 그의 목적을 진전시키기 위해서만 사용될 것임을 깨달은 바스타리는 연구자료를 챙기고 강력한 강령술사인 남편 텔라카와 함께 떠났다.\n"
"\n"
"그들은 함께 매니마코의 손아귀에서 도망쳤으며, 결국엔 발렌우드 깊은 곳에 있는 에일리드 유적에 은신하게 되었다. 그들은 그곳에서 많은 세월을 보내며 조용히 자신들의 작업을 수행할 수 있었다. 수십 년 동안 그들은 각자 행복해 보였다... 바스타리가 떠나던 날까지는 말이다.\n"
"\n"
"바스타리는 몇 년 동안 넌의 지표면을 방랑하면서 힘을 지닌 장소들을 탐험하였다. 그녀는 웨이레스트, 알리키'어, 수정탑, 그리고 듄의 도서관들을 방문했으며, 자신의 영혼을 괴롭히던 문제에 대한 해답을 찾아다녔다.\n"
"\n"
"이윽고 바스타리는 자신이 찾던 것을 발견하여 발렌우드로 돌아갔다. 그녀는 거기서 탑을 세웠고, 견습생들을 받아들여 자신이 지닌 특별한 종류의 강령술과 자신의 연구 성과에 대해서 가르쳤다.\n"
"\n"
"우리는 바스타리의 인장 정동석을 사용해서 하급 데이드라의 영혼을 속박하고, 소울젬을 사용해서 영혼이 오블리비언으로 돌아가는 것을 지연시켰다. 그러고 나서 붙잡힌 영혼을 세상에 드러내는 방법을 연구하였다.\n"
"\n"
"초기의 시도는 예상치 못했던 위험한 결과를 불러왔다. 정동석이 조각나버렸고, 부서진 수정체의 파편이 우리 학생들의 살점에 박혀버린 것이다. 잘못 적용된 기운이 살아있는 존재의 영혼들을 아주 작은 돌에 묶어놓아 버렸다. 하지만 우리는 학습을 통하여 실수를 바로잡았고 그 과정을 개선하였다.\n"
"\n"
"결국 바스타리는 이 기술을 완벽하게 익혀낼 수 있었다. 죽음의 순간에 인장 정동석을 사용하여 영혼을 그 깊은 곳에 넣어둘 수 있었던 것이다. 소환마법을 응용하면 정동석의 영혼을 외형질의 껍데기로 끌어내어 잠시동안 의견을 교환할 수도 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"바스타리는 자신의 발견을 메이지 길드에 알리는 편지를 썼다. 바누스 갈레리온이 직접 시연을 보러 왔고, 그 시연에는 시연 과정에 자원한 늙은 관리인의 영혼과 소통하는 과정이 포함되어 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"바스타리가 관리인의 영혼을 자신의 기구에 속박하자 갈레리온은 충격에 빠졌고, 과정이 완료되어 늙은 관리인의 영혼이 풀려나 에테리우스로 돌아갈 수 있게 되었을 때는 얼굴이 하얗게 질려 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"갈레리온은 천천히 일어나 모여들었던 학생들에게 말했다. 그가 평소에 보여주던 겸손한 태도와는 다른, 보복적이고 분노에 찬 그 말은 누구도 예상하지 못했던 것이었다. 그는 말을 끝마치고는 몸을 돌려 떠났다.\n"
"\n"
"몇몇은 갈레리온을 따라갔다. 누구도 그들을 비난할 순 없다. 갈레리온이 틀린 것은 아니었으니까. 인장 정동석은 위험한 창조물이었다. 오용된다면 전쟁의 불씨가 되어 우리 역사상 전례가 없었던 파괴를 불러올 수도 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"바스타리는 단념하지 않았고, 갈레리온의 고의적인 무지가 그를 실패로 이끌게 될 것이라고 설득해 보았지만, 그 후에 다른 무언가가 그녀의 관심을 빼앗아 버렸다. 바스타리가 세웠던 탑의 토대 아래에서 어마어마한 규모의 유적이 발견된 것이었다. 그 유적은 데이드릭 군주의 힘에 의해 그때까지 숨겨져 왔었다.\n"
"\n"
"이윽고 바스타리는 그 유적에 들어가 다시는 나오지 않았다. 우리 중 몇몇은 지금도 그녀가 돌아오기를 기다리고 있다."

"Inscribed by Beredalmo the Signifier\n"
"\n"
"Here is a truth read from the bark. \n"
"\n"
"The spike of Ada-Mantia, and its Zero Stone, dictated the structure of reality in its Aurbic vicinity, defining for the Earth Bones their story or nature within the unfolding of the Dragon's (timebound) Tale. The Aldmeri or Merethic Elves were singular of purpose only so long as it took them to realize that other Towers, with their own Stones, could tell different stories, each following rules inscribed by Variorum Architects. And so the Mer self-refracted, each to their own creation, the Chimer following Red-Heart, the Bosmer burgeoning Green-Sap, the Altmer erecting Crystal-Like-Law, et alia.\n"
"\n"
"But of all the Prismatic Mer, none were more presumptuous than the Ayleids of the Heartland. They built their tower in open emulation of Ada-Mantia, using as Founding-Stone the great red diamond they had uncovered: Chim-el-Adabal, said to be crystallized blood from the Heart of Lorkhan itself. (For the Heart on its arrow passed over the Heartlands, birthing one of that postnymic's quaternary meanings.) \n"
"\n"
"Thus did White-Gold become Tower One. As all know.\n"
"\n"
"As foretold by the moth-eyed, Ayleid hubris was to bear bitter fruit. With their vision on high to behold the overworlds, they failed to note the seething Nedelings at their feet, until the thralls rose up and took their Tower away from them. Chim-el-Adabal they took as well, but not before the arch-mage Anumaril fangled an eightfold Staff of Towers, each segment a semblance of a tower in its Dance. And then seven of these segments were borne by White-Gold Knights to distant Fold-Places, where they were hidden.\n"
"\n"
"(This was all unknown to Pelin-al-Essia, be certain, or there might have been a different Eight Divines!)\n"
"\n"
"Thus White-Gold. On to Green-Sap. \n"
"\n"
"The Boiche Elves were of the Earth Bones who most hearkened to Jephre and his greensongs. They did not build a Tower, they grew it, a great graht-oak whose roots sprang from a Perchance Acorn. And this was their Stone. And because the Acorn might perchance have been elsewhere, thus was Green-Sap manifold and several. And each could walk. \n"
"\n"
"Therefore each Green-Sap was also every Green-Sap. Within each were told all the stories of the Green, with every ending true, so doors therein were not always Doors Certain. But to this the Boiche-become-Bosmer became inured, and indeed grew to relish these Doors Equivocal, for such was their nature in the schism of the prism. In this way the Bosmer learned which songs made the trees dance, and which dances they might do. \n"
"\n"
"Now return we must to the eighth segment—or rather Segment One, for Anumaril had fangled it in similitude to Tower One, which itself reflected Tower Zero. When the Ayleids fled the Heartlands they went to all eight corners of the compass, and this was a chosen thing, though many corners spelled doom. But more Ayleids fled to Valenwood than to all other directions combined, and this, too, was chosen. Among these clans went Anumaril wearing Segment One as a femur—for how but by walking can a spoke advance its hub?\n"
"\n"
"Green-Sap's Elves welcomed the Ayleids so long as the Heartlanders agreed not to dissonate the greensong. All agreed to this save Anumaril, who coughed into his hand unnoticed. He asked the Great Camoran to show him Green-Sap, and was brought to one that by happenstance stood then in Elden Root. Once within the great graht he passed through a Door Equivocal and found his desire, the Perchance Acorn. It was one of many, but for Anumaril one was enough. \n"
"\n"
"Next the fanglement: Anumaril brought forth Segment One among the roots and showed it to the golden nut, and this told an ending, so that the stone became a Definite Acorn. That Elden Tree would not walk again, but Anumaril yet had further intentions for it. Using his dentition as tonal instruments, he dismantled his bones and built of them a Mundus-machine that mirrored Nirn and its planets. And when he had used all his substance in fangling this orrery, he placed the segment-sceptre within, hiding it between the Moons. \n"
"\n"
"Then he waited—but what he waited for did not eventuate, and perchance he's waiting yet. For Anumaril had hoped to convert Green-Sap into White-Gold, and thereby make the Heartlanders' realm anew. However, Anumaril did not know, and was not able to know, why his plan went awry. You see, Ayleid magic is about Will, and Shall, and Must—but under Green-Sap, all is Perchance. \n"
"\n"
"The Ayleid fangler's plan could not succeed—and yet neither could it fail. For this is a story that has not yet found its ending."

"By Cuinur of Cloudrest, 4th Tier Scholar of Tamrielic Minutiae\n"
"\n"
"This report was commissioned by the Thalmor Committee of Alliance Relations to investigate whether there might be an indoctrinal advantage to emphasizing the Ayleid lineage woven into the bloodlines of our cousins the Wood Elves. My extensive travels in Valenwood have enabled me to determine the historical facts behind the matter; whether these facts can support a useful campaign promoting alliance fellowship is up to the Committee and the Sapiarch of Indoctrination. \n"
"\n"
"As Pluribel of Dusk has noted in her magisterial \"Collapse of the Ayleids,\" blame for the White-Gold Catastrophe of 1E 243 can be attributed to a half-dozen disastrous factors, of which the bloody insurrection by indentured human laborers may not be the most important. Pluribel emphasizes, quite rightly in my belief, the Narfinsel Schism of the late Merethic Era, which pitted the more conservative Aedra-worshiping Ayleid clans against those decadent yet undeniably vigorous clans that had adopted Daedra-worship. This conflict reached its climax in 1E 198 at the Scouring of Wendelbek, when King Glinferen of Atatar led a combined force of Daedraphile warriors against the traditionalist Barsaebics of Ayleidoon. The Barsaebics were driven out of the Heartland into northwest Argonia, and thereafter organized opposition to Daedra-worship in Cyrodiil was effectively over. \n"
"\n"
"In any event, by most measures Ayleid civilization had been in decline for several generations by the time the White-Gold Tower fell to the savagery of the Nedes. Standing amid the ruins of a great Elven culture, the victors concocted a justification for the blood on their hands by painting the defeated clans as vicious Daedraphiles who reveled in torture and cruelty. An exception was made for those clans, mainly Aedric adherents, who had thrown in their lot with the hordes of the Slave-Queen. Of course, this only delayed their extermination, for the barbarous Nedes inevitably came after their former allies once the other Elves of Cyrodiil had been hunted to extinction. \n"
"\n"
"Thus began the Ayleid Diaspora, in which the Heartland Elves sought to find new homes elsewhere in Tamriel—to decidedly mixed success. Those who fled north into the lands once held by the Falmer were slaughtered by Nords led by the infamous Vrage the Butcher. The Barsaebics, by that time well established in Argonia, refused admittance to their former persecutors the Atatarics, and most of that clan died on an ill-fated expedition into the lands of the Cat-Men. Several clans set out on the long march through Hammerfell to the Iliac Bay, and some actually made it, where they joined with (and were absorbed by) the long-established Direnni of Balfiera. \n"
"\n"
"Most successful—and they were more than a few—were the clans that fled southwest beneath the canopy of Valenwood. The clans of Anutwyll, Vilverin, Talwinque, Bawn, and Varondo all escaped largely intact to carve out a new life under the trees. These clans all worshiped Daedric Princes, but they seem to have done so with less fervor after their enforced migration to Valenwood—possibly due to the fact that the Princes, when called upon, had offered little or no help to the forsaken clans. Fortunately their new hosts, the Bosmer, were remarkably generous in welcoming the Ayleids into their realm, so long as the Heartland Elves agreed to adopt aspects of the Green Pact and refrain from harming the forest. Having little choice, the Ayleids agreed, and this probably contributed to the dilution of their culture. \n"
"\n"
"For diluted it was, absorbed over time, and eventually forgotten. I have walked the great Ayleid ruins of Valenwood—Hectahame, Rulanyil's Fall, Belarata, Laeloria, and a dozen more—and none of them, not one, was still occupied only two thousand years after the Diaspora. For some reason, once the Ayleids were under the great graht-oaks they, and their distinctive culture, simply melted away. \n"
"\n"
"In explaining the extinction of the Valenwood Ayleids, my predecessor Gelgarad the Velaspid was very attached to his \"Theorem of Disheritage,\" which held that for some reason the Forest Ayleids became unable to breed with each other and could only generate offspring by mating with the local Bosmer. This would certainly account for the Ayleids' gradual disappearance, but unfortunately Gelgarad's theorem is supported only by old stories and legends, and absent facts it cannot be proven. \n"
"\n"
"It is worth mentioning here the competing theory of Doctor Thetis of the Shimmerene Academy. Her explanation blames Ayleid decline on over-consumption of the unusually potent beverages of the Bosmer. Doctor Thetis believes the Ayleids, vulnerable in their grief over their losses, fell prey to the Wood Elves' paralyzing brews and simply gave up trying. In this they may have been encouraged by the Bosmer themselves, who often seem insulted by others' displays of industrious effort.\n"
"\n"
"And what did our forest-dwelling cousins learn from the Ayleids? Precious little, apparently, other than some advanced techniques of stonework and masonry. Heartland Elven culture seems to have made little lasting impression on the culture of the Wood Elves. Their attitude seems to me summed up by the statement of Fonlor, the Yorethane of Elden Root, whose response when I asked him about the Ayleids was as follows: \"The Ayleids? Oh, yes. Nice fellows. Took themselves too seriously, though, and what did it get them?\""

"Everyone knows what happened to Gil-Var-Delle. And at the same time, no one does.\n"
"Legend has it that Molag Bal, the dreaded Daedric Prince, set foot into that Wood Elf township—consumed it, according to the myth—whatever that actually means. Ancient tales employ metaphors like armies employ soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"If Bal himself visited this plane with evil intent, why do any of us remain? The stories about him would lead one to believe he would not have stopped with the razing of a single Wood Elf town—he wouldn't have stopped until all of Tamriel was in flames. Just one common question of many regarding the Daedric Prince's so-called visit.\n"
"\n"
"Some retort that perhaps someone stopped him—possibly an opposing Daedric Prince, a Divine, or an agent of the Aedra. But again, where is the evidence for this? No mage or historian—that I've spoken to, at least—has been able to reference a specific text for this information.\n"
"\n"
"Many a historical fiction piece has attempted to dramatize what occurred there, but none of those stories can be confirmed, except to say that a catastrophic event struck the town. Perhaps the residents were killed, perhaps they fled. None were ever heard from again, but for all anyone knows, a large fire could have been the culprit. I can't imagine anything more catastrophic than that to a Wood Elf dwelling.\n"

"While the Wood Elves of the towns are largely content with their drink and the luxuries provided by Imperial trade, remote tribes in the depths of the jungle are far more savage. War is constantly waged under the eaves of Valenwood. When the tribes are not raiding the Khajiit in earnest, they are raiding one another for sport.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike civilized peoples, tribal Bosmer do not fight for any meaningful or constructive purpose. They seem incapable of grasping the concept of fighting for control of land, resources, or defensible borders. Though they may swarm to push out those who harm Valenwood, they evince little interest in conquest for its own sake. Rather, the Wood Elves raid one another for booty, bragging, and boredom—in that order. Tribal raiders typically rustle timber mammoths and thunderbugs. Many steal items (or people) that can be ransomed back to the owners.\n"
"\n"
"This erratic, irregular warfare is not pursued to the death. Deaths do occur, but they are incidental and usually regretted. Many raids conclude with no fighting whatsoever. It is considered the acme of skill to slip into another tribe's village and steal an item for ransom without being noticed. The larger the item, the greater the prestige. Thanks to centuries of this practice, the tribal Bosmer have become legendary for their stealth. The title of their most famous poem, the Meh Ayleidion, means \"The One Thousand Benefits of Hiding.\"\n"
"\n"
"When death occurs in battle, an archaic provision of the Meat Mandate requires that a fallen enemy must be eaten completely before three days pass. This tradition is now only followed in the most remote and savage villages. The family members of the warrior who slaughtered the enemy may help him with his meal.\n"
"\n"
"The tradition of the \"Mourning War\" is still followed nearly everywhere outside the cities. When a tribe member is slain, he or she is symbolically replaced via a hostage-taking raid. The tribe will seize a captive from a neighboring band. If the deceased was an especially powerful or prestigious member of the tribe, multiple captives may be taken to replace them.\n"
"\n"
"After a period of physical torture, supposedly to test their worthiness, the captive is joyously welcomed into the clan. This sudden reversal from horrific abuse to loving embrace befuddles the weak wits of a Bosmer captive, who cleaves to his tormentors. Traditionally the victim was given the deceased tribe member's position, possessions, and family, though this practice may be rarely honored nowadays."

"Metal weapons have never been widespread in Valenwood. The Wood Elves' Green Pact proscribes the use of wood to kindle forge-fires, though in some areas the burning of peat or coal can get kilns up to metal-forging temperatures. Other Bosmer make do with bone clubs, or use axes and spears with blades of stone or obsidian.\n"
"\n"
"In the coastal towns such as Haven and Port Velyn, Bosmeri swordsmanship has benefited from the tutelage of Altmer advisors and a reliable supply of imported metal weapons. Strangely, the High Elves are not similarly appreciative of the Bosmeri composite horn bows, which are arguably the finest in Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"While some have described the Dominion as an alliance of mutual convenience, I would characterize it as one of mutual exasperation. Swordsmanship is a case in point. Few Wood Elves have the mental discipline for traditional Altmeri martial schooling. They are easily distracted, and have no patience for the philosophical aspects of the training. Altmeri masters, who describe their system of swordsmanship as \"Proper Conflict,\" refused to adapt their techniques to the smaller stature and shorter reach of their pupils.\n"
"\n"
"So the Bosmer returned to their traditional method of warfare: archery. By the age of fourteen, a Wood Elf youth is proficient enough with the bow to accompany hunting parties. Long-distance archers are called Jaqspurs. The style of draw used by Jaqspurs has been described as \"snatching and releasing in one continuous motion.\" This allows a Jaqspur to maintain a very high rate of shooting, though years of training are required to be accurate at such speed.\n"
"\n"
"The Bosmer are perfectly willing to purchase and use wooden bows and arrows crafted by other races, but the Green Pact prevents them from making any of their own. Traditional Bosmer bows are crafted from horn and sinew. Strings are also made of sinew; Khajiiti gut is said to work best, and is thus prized among Valenwood archers. \n"
"\n"
"Bosmeri arrows are carved from bone, and fletched with the feathers of various bird species. The Wood Elves believe the source of bone used influences the characteristics of the arrow. Mammoth bone arrows are thought to strike with enough force to knock down a target. Bird bone arrows fly faster and more accurately. Senche-tiger bone arrows deal extra damage. Trials by Imperial observers have been unable to replicate these alleged effects. Upon hearing this, the Bosmer merely cluck their tongues and smile."

"\n"
"By Brother Mikhael Karkuxor of the Imperial College\n"
"\n"
"The Eight\n"
"\n"
"(though few Bosmer outside the Empire accept the limitation of Divines to eight):\n"
"\n"
"Auri-El (King of the Aldmer):\n"
"\n"
"The Elven Akatosh is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of Anui-El, who, in turn, is the soul of Anu the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons. Most Altmeri and Bosmeri claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of Lorkhan in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Aldmer, Altmora and Old Ehlnofey. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.\n"
"\n"
"Y'ffre (God of the Forest):\n"
"\n"
"Most important deity of the Bosmeri pantheon. While Auri-El the Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, the Bosmer revere Y'ffre as the spirit of \"the now.\" According to the Wood Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the Ehlnofey, or \"Earth Bones.\" After these laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it. Y'ffre is sometimes called the Storyteller, for the lessons he taught the first Bosmer. Some Bosmer still possess the knowledge of the chaos times, which they can use to great effect (the Wild Hunt).\n"
"\n"
"Arkay (God of the Cycle of Life and Death):               \n"
"\n"
"Arkay is the god of burials and funeral rites, and is sometimes associated with the seasons. His priests are staunch opponents of necromancy and all forms of the undead. It is said that Arkay did not exist before the world was created by the gods under Lorkhan's supervision/urging/trickery. Therefore, he is sometimes called the Mortals' God.\n"
"\n"
"Xarxes:\n"
"\n"
"Xarxes is the god of ancestry and secret knowledge. He began as a scribe to Auri-El, and has kept track of all Aldmeri accomplishments, large and small, since the beginning of time. He created his wife, Oghma, from his favorite moments in history.\n"
"\n"
"Mara (Goddess of Love):\n"
"\n"
"Nearly universal goddess. Origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the \"Anuad,\" the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. For the Bosmer, she is the wife of Auri-El.\n"
"\n"
"Stendarr (God of Mercy):\n"
"\n"
"God of compassion and righteous rule. In early Aldmeri legends, Stendarr is the apologist of Men.\n"
"\n"
"Z'en (God of Toil):\n"
"\n"
"Bosmeri god of payment in kind, which includes both just remuneration and retribution. Studies indicate origins in both Argonian and Akaviri mythologies, perhaps introduced into Valenwood by Kothringi sailors. Ostensibly an agriculture deity, Z'en sometimes proves to be an entity of a much higher cosmic order.\n"
"\n"
"Baan Dar (The Bandit God):\n"
"\n"
"Trickster spirit of thieves and beggars borrowed from the Khajiit.\n"
"\n"
"Additional Deities with Significant Bosmeri Cults:\n"
"\n"
"Herma-Mora (The Woodland Man):\n"
"\n"
"Malicious trickster spirit (another one!) whose Bosmeri cultists say is not to be confused with the Daedra Hermaeus Mora. (Others deride this assertion.)\n"
"\n"
"Jone and Jode (Little Moon God and Big Moon God):\n"
"\n"
"Aldmeri gods of the Moons, they are spirits of fortune, both good and bad.\n"
"\n"
"Hircine (The Huntsman, Father of Manbeasts):\n"
"\n"
"Master of the Great Hunt and lord of all lycanthropes. Worshipers of Hircine are not as ruthless as those who worship other Daedra; they always give their prey at least a small chance to escape.\n"
"\n"
"Lorkhan (The Missing God):\n"
"\n"
"This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri \"Lorkhan,\" or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo—much like his father Padomay had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. He and his metaphysical placement in the \"scheme of things\" is interpreted a variety of ways. To the Elves, he is the most unholy of all higher powers, as he forever broke their connection to the spirit plane. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind."

"이 창조주이자 재주꾼이자 시험자인 신은 모든 탐리엘 신화의 근본이다. 그의 가장 유명한 이름은 알드머 언어로 \"로칸\" 즉 종말의 북이다. 그는 아버지인 파도메이가 시작의 장소인 우주에 불안정성을 유도한 것과 유사하게 근원적 영혼들을 설득 혹은 부추겨서 필멸자의 차원을 만들었다. 세계를 창조한 후 로카즈는 신적인 중심에서 격리되었다. 이는 본의가 아니었다는 설도 있지만 그는 et'Ada의 창조지를 헤메었다. 엘프들에게는, 강력한 신성들 중에서 정신세계와의 연결을 영원히 깨뜨린 그가 가장 부정한 것으로 인식된다. 그와 그의 \"계획\"의 추상적 설계에 대해서는 문화에 따라 해석이 갈린다. 전설 속에서 그는 거의 언제나 알드머의 적이자 초기 인류의 영웅으로 묘사된다."

"by Brother Mikhael Karkuxor of the Imperial College\n"
"\n"
"As fits their heterodoxy of form, the Khajiit worship many gods, and few confine themselves to the Imperial Eight.\n"
"\n"
"The Eight:\n"
"\n"
"Alkosh (Dragon King of Cats):\n"
"\n"
"Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anequinine deity. A variation on the Altmeri Auri-El, and thus an Akatosh-as-culture-hero for the earliest Khajiit. His worship was co-opted during the establishment of the Riddle'Thar, and he still enjoys immense popularity in Elsweyr's wasteland regions. He is depicted as a fearsome dragon, a creature the Khajiit say \"is just a real big cat.\" He repelled an early Aldmeri pogrom of Pelinal Whitestrake during mythic times.\n"
"\n"
"Riddle'Thar (Two-Moons Dance):\n"
"\n"
"The cosmic order deity of the Khajiit, the Riddle'Thar was revealed to Elsweyr by the prophet Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, the Mane. The Riddle'Thar is more a set of guidelines by which to live than a single entity, but some of his avatars like to appear as humble messengers of the gods. Also known as the Sugar God.\n"
"\n"
"Jone and Jode (Little Moon God and Big Moon God):\n"
"\n"
"Together, the moons represent duality, fate, and luck. In Khajiiti religion, Jone and Jode are aspects of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.\n"
"\n"
"Mara (Mother Cat):\n"
"\n"
"Nearly universal goddess. Originally a fertility goddess, the Khajiit associate her with Nir of the \"Anuad,\" the female principle of the cosmos. She is the lover of Alkosh.\n"
"\n"
"S'rendarr (The Runt; God of Mercy):\n"
"\n"
"S'rendarr's sphere includes compassion, charity, and justice. In early Aldmeri legends, S'rendarr is the apologist of Men.\n"
"\n"
"Khenarthi (God of Winds):\n"
"\n"
"Khenarthi is the strongest of the Sky spirits. In some legends, he is the first to agree to Lorkhaj's plan to invent the mortal plane, and provides the space for its creation in the void. He is also associated with rain, a phenomenon said not to occur before the removal of Lorkhaj's divine spark.\n"
"\n"
"Baan Dar (The Bandit God):\n"
"\n"
"In most regions, Baan Dar is a marginal deity, a trickster spirit of thieves and beggars. In Elsweyr he is more important, and is regarded as the Pariah. In this aspect, Baan Dar becomes the cleverness or desperate genius of the long-suffering Khajiit, whose last-minute plans always upset the machinations of their (Elven or Human) enemies. He has also lent his name to the Baandari Pedlars, the traveling Khajiiti merchant tribe.\n"
"\n"
"Additional Deities with Significant Khajiiti Cults:\n"
"\n"
"Magrus (Cat's Eye, Sun God):\n"
"\n"
"Khajiiti version of Magnus, the god of the sun and sorcery, popular with Khajiiti magicians (though less so than Azurah).\n"
"\n"
"Rajhin (The Footpad):\n"
"\n"
"Thief and trickster god, the Purring Liar, much beloved of Khajiiti storytellers. Rajhin grew up in the Black Kiergo section of Senchal. The most famous burglar in Elsweyr's history, Rajhin is said to have stolen a tattoo from the neck of Empress Kintyra as she slept.\n"
"\n"
"Azurah (Goddess of Dusk and Dawn):\n"
"\n"
"Patron of Khajiiti magicians, respected rather than feared for her sometime trickery. In myth she is tied into the origins of Khajiiti out of Aldmeri stock.\n"
"\n"
"Sheggorath (Skooma Cat, the Mad God):\n"
"\n"
"The King of Insanity appeals to the darker side of the Cat-Men, who chafe at the strictures of sanity and responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"Hircine (Hungry Cat):\n"
"\n"
"God of hunting and skinchanging, revered for his fierceness and cunning.\n"
"\n"
"Sangiin (Blood Cat):\n"
"\n"
"God of Death and Secret Murder, Sangiin's worship is hidden from Cat's Eye. \"For who can control the urges of blood?\"\n"
"\n"
"Namiira (The Great Darkness):\n"
"\n"
"An enemy of the living, to be placated rather than worshiped.\n"
"\n"
"Lorkhaj (Moon Beast):\n"
"\n"
"Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anequinine deity, easily identified with the Missing God, Lorkhan. This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo—much like his father Padomay had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhaj is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. He and his metaphysical placement in the \"scheme of things\" is interpreted a variety of ways. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind."

"\n"
"여덟 디바인:\n"
"\n"
"알코쉬 (고양이들의 용왕):\n"
"\n"
"전대 리닷타 왕조 아네퀴니네의 신. 알트머의 아우리엘의 변화형 중 하나로, 아카토쉬가 선대 카짓의 문화적 영웅으로 변화된 모습이다. 그의 숭배는 리들타의 설립과 동시에 이루어져 엘스웨어의 불모지 지방에서는 지금도 큰 인기를 얻고 있다. 그 모습은 무시무시한 드래곤, 카짓들 사이에서는 \"진짜 엄청나게 커다란 고양이\"로 묘사된다. 신화 시대, 펠리날 화이트스트레이크의 초기 알드머 학살을 격퇴했다고 전해진다.\n"
"\n"
"리들타 (쌍둥이 달의 춤):\n"
"\n"
"카짓의 우주를 관장하는 신, 리들타는 선지자인 갈기의 리드-타-리닷타에 의해 엘스웨어에 알려졌다. 리들타는 단일적인 독립체라기보다는 삶의 지침으로서 알려져 있지만 그의 화산은 신의 초라한 전령으로 나타나는 것을 좋아한다. 설탕의 신으로도 알려져 있다.\n"
"\n"
"존과 조디 (작은 달의 신과 큰 달의 신):\n"
"\n"
"둘이서 함께 이중성, 운명 및 행운을 대표하는 달. 카짓의 종교에서 존과 조디는 달의 격자 또는 자-카제이의 형상을 띄고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"마라 (어미 고양이):\n"
"\n"
"만물의 여신 같은 존재. 원래는 풍요의 여신이지만 카짓은 \"아누아드\"의 니르와 결부시켜 여성적인 우주의 원칙으로 간주한다. 알코쉬의 연인이다.\n"
"\n"
"스렌다르 (새끼 고양이, 자비의 신):\n"

"\n"
"케나르시 (바람의 신):\n"
"\n"
"케나르시는 하늘을 맡은 영혼 중 가장 강력하다. 몇몇 전설에 따르면 필멸자의 차원을 만드려는 로칸의 계획에 가장 먼저 동의하고, 공허 속에 차원을 만들 수 있는 공간을 제공했다. 그는 비와도 관련되어 있다고 하는데 이는 로칸의 신성이 사라지기 전에는 없었다고 한다.\n"
"\n"
"바안 다르 (도적의 신):\n"
"\n"
"대부분의 지방에서 바안 다르는 별로 중요하지 않은 신으로 간주된다. 그는 도적과 부랑자들이 받드는 사기와 협잡의 정신 그 자체이다. 엘스웨어에서 그는 더욱 중요한 존재로 여겨지는데, 버림받은 자의 형상으로 묘사된다. 버림받은 자로서의 바안 다르는 참을성 있는 카짓 중에서도 영리한 자 혹은 절망에 빠진 천재로서 나타난다. 그가 짜낸 최후의 계책은 언제나 그들의 적(엘프나 인간)에 의해 끝내는 틀어지고 마는 것이다. 또한 그는 자신의 이름을 떠돌아다니는 카짓 상인 집단인 바안다리 행상인에게 빌려 주었다.\n"

"도둑이자 사기꾼 신. 갸르릉대는 거짓말쟁이. 카짓 이야기꾼에게 사랑받고 있다. 라진은 센샬의 블랙 키르고 지역에서 자랐다. 엘스웨어 사상 가장 유명한 절도범인 라진은 여제 킨티라가 자는 동안에 그녀의 목에서 문신을 훔쳐냈다는 이야기가 전해지고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"아주라 (새벽과 여명의 여신):\n"
"\n"
"카짓 마법사의 수호자. 가끔씩 보이는 속임수 때문에 두려움받기보다는 존경받는다. 신화에 따르면 알드머 혈통에서 떨어져 나온 카짓의 기원과 관련되어 있다.\n"
"\n"
"쉐고라스 (스쿠마의 고양이, 광기의 신):\n"

"Observations by Raynard, Academic of Mournhold\n"
"\n"
"They call them Dreamwalkers. Beings that can, with a simple spell, step into the dreams of another. Your darkest desires, your most bizarre fantasies, your true self, all revealed to these Dreamwalkers like an open book. Your most prized memories ransacked and picked through like the leavings of last night's feast.\n"
"\n"
"Those who Dreamwalk are said to have sworn themselves to the Daedric Prince Vaermina. To have sold their souls for the ability to enter her plane, the Dreamstride. The veracity of this claim, I cannot say, but the similarities between what Dreamwalkers do and what the Priests of Vaermina accomplish is quite uncanny.\n"
"\n"
"The only difference I could ascertain was how each entered the dream state. Vaermina's priests require nothing more than the drop of an alchemical concoction, a draft prepared by the most brilliant alchemists. The Dreamwalkers, however, require no such potion. They conjure a magic that appears to be innate, not taught or passed down by some hereditary process. Were they blessed by the Daedric Prince? Did their parents perform some sacred ritual to acquire this power upon birth? None I have spoken to truly know. Or will say, one way or another.\n"
"\n"
"But what of the Dreamwalkers themselves? What do they use this power to achieve? Think of the havoc one could cause by entering the dreams of another. That's a frightening thought, indeed.\n"
"\n"
"Yet, the Dreamwalkers I met were kind and gentle. They use their powers to help others. They eliminate painful memories. Cure mental illnesses that not even the best healers can mend. They accomplish incredible things by simply touching a person's dreams. I know, for I saw a Dreamwalker in action.\n"
"\n"
"My wife and children contracted the Knahaten Flu. It was a terrible way to die, slow and painful. When they died, my reason to live died with them. But the Dreamwalker I met, he took pity on me. He gave me an opportunity to remember my family while forgetting the pain of losing them. To become numb to the loss and remember them as they were before the illness. To remember the happiness and the love.\n"
"\n"
"The Dreamwalker entered my dreams. When I woke, a calmness had filled me. Everything was all right. I could go on with my life. I wanted to thank him, but he was gone. I never saw him again.\n"
"\n"
"Whoever the Dreamwalkers are, whatever master they ultimately serve, I will forever be in their debt. But this fact doesn't eliminate the fear that lingers at the back of my mind. Was it right to take away the pain?  Aren't memories the thing that makes us unique? Have I become someone else because my memories have been changed? It seems I have replaced pain with fear, and I'm not sure which I prefer."

"By Narsis Dren, Treasure Hunter\n"
"\n"
"Dotting the landscape of Skyrim, the ancient Nord ruins are a testament to the ingenuity of the Nord people of the past. When constructing the final resting places for the noble class, our ancestors proved to be quite crafty, developing some of the most sophisticated and clever defenses I have ever encountered. Coupled with the presence of the fearsome draugr, these tombs have become quite a challenge for me.\n"
"\n"
"The most often-overlooked obstacles are the abundance of traps spread throughout the tombs. Ranging from simple tripwire-activated rock falls to complex pressure plate-triggered dart traps, the ancient Nords utilized these devices abundantly. Most of the traps can be bypassed by simply looking for the trigger mechanism and avoiding them. Since they are most often placed in areas where distractions abound, remember to keep your eyes to the floor.\n"
"\n"
"One of the keys to surviving in a Nord ruin is to use these traps to gain an upper hand against any denizens occupying the ruin. In many cases, it's trivial to lure them across the triggering mechanism. Try this when you find an oil trap. Using a bow, lure your victim onto the oil and then loose an arrow at the fire pot hanging above. The moment the fire pot shatters, the entire pool of oil ignites and engulfs the enemy in hot death. Just be certain that you're standing clear of the oil, or else this trick could end your expedition earlier than you planned.\n"
"\n"
"Perhaps one of the most amazing engineering marvels of all has little to do with the traps designed to kill. Utilizing all manner of pull chains, levers, switches, and pressure plates, some of the most frustrating obstacles can occur in the form of puzzles that threaten to block your progress. Watch for the telltale signs of these barriers: groups of levers in a single place, rotating pillars with carvings on all faces, and even large arrays of pressure plates covering the floor of a room. In most cases, the puzzle requires experimentation to solve. In others, the solution might actually be found elsewhere in the complex. It's recommended to keep a writing implement and a journal handy so that you can always take notes about whatever you find. You never know when you might need to refer to something from elsewhere in the complex.\n"
"\n"
"Although Nord ruins are commonly infested with vermin, including skeevers and spiders, these creatures pale in comparison to the mighty draugr. These horrific, animated dead are commonly found as guardians in most of the tombs, and they defend them mercilessly. Since the draugr tend to lay dormant until someone happens upon their resting place, it's advisable to keep an eye out for niches and sarcophagi. These undead animate rapidly and silently, so always watch your back. Any remains you pass could suddenly animate and set upon you without warning.\n"
"\n"
"The perils of a Nord ruin are not without reward. The burial chambers in some of the larger complexes contain all manners of riches, from gold to the occasional enchanted weapon or armor. Never ignore the ceremonial urns that dot the ruins, as they are often filled with ancient offerings of great value.\n"
"\n"
"I've tried to be comprehensive with what I know of Nord ruins, but I'm sure there are dangers lurking within that will prove to be unique and never before seen. Just be sure to always enter these tombs with plenty of equipment and a good, solid weapon by your side. With a bit of patience, a keen eye, and a light step, a Nord ruin can bring you great wealth. If you follow my advice. Otherwise, you risk becoming a permanent resident, like many of those who tried to loot the place before you."

"스카이림의 토지에 자리잡고 있는 고대 노드의 유적에서, 옛 노드인의 창조성을 엿볼 수 있다. 귀족계급의 무덤을 지을때, 이'야만적'이라고도 불리는 사람들은, 전혀 야만스럽지 않다는 것을 증명한다. 그들은 이제껏 접한 종족들 중 가장 세련되고 영리한 방어기술을 개발하고 있었다. 거기에다가 무서운 드로거의 존재까지 합쳐짐으로써, 이 무덤들은 신참 도굴꾼들에게 상당한 시련이 되고있다.\n"
"\n"
"가장 방심하기 쉬운 것은, 무덤 여기저기에 깔려있는 무수한 함정이다. 단순한 와이어식 낙석장치부터 복잡한 압력판식 화살장치 함정까지, 노드인은 이러한 장치를 폭넓게 사용한다. 대부분의 경우에는, 작동장치를 미리 발견하여 해당 장치를 건드리지 않으면 된다. 함정주변에 작동장치가 있는 경우가 대다수이기 때문에 주로 바닥쪽을 주의하는 것이 좋은 방법이다.\n"
"\n"
"노드의 유적에서 살아 남는 방법 중 하나가, 함정을 능숙하게 이용하여, 무덤을 지키는 존재들보다 전략적으로 우위에 서는 것이다.  대다수의 경우, 작동장치쪽으로 적들을 유인하는 방법을 쓴다. 이 방법은 기름함정에서도 사용할 수 있다. 원거리 공격을 사용해 공격목표를 기름위까지 유인한 후, 위에 매달린 등잔에 화살을 발사한다. 등잔이 산산이 부서지면서, 기름이 고여있는 바닥 전체에 불이 붙어 공격목표를 불로 삼켜버린다. 단 자신이 위치한 곳이 함정의 범위밖이 아닌 경우에 이 방법을 쓰면 당신의 모험은 순식간에 끝나버릴 수도 있다.\n"
"\n"
"아마 유적에서 발견되는 모든 기술들 중 가장 경이적인 것은, 죽이기 위해 설계된 함정들이 아니다. 쇠사슬을 당김으로서 작동되는 장치, 레버, 스위치, 압력판을 모두 활용해, 퍼즐의 형태로 여러분의 앞을 가로막는 경우가 있다. 이러한 장벽의 징후에도 주의하도록 하자. 한 곳에 여러개의 레버가 있거나, 회전하는 기둥에 조각이 되어 있거나, 큰 압력판이 바닥에 진열되어 있기도 한다. 대부분의 경우 퍼즐을 조작하여 실험해볼 수 있으며, 유적 어딘가에서 힌트나 답을 찾을 수 있다. 나중을 위해서 필기용구와 일지를 준비해 두는 것을 권장한다.\n"
"\n"
"노드의 유적에는 보통 스키버나 거미등의 해충이 출몰하지만, 드로거과 비교하면 사소한 재난에 불과하다. 이 움직이는 무서운 시체는 대부분 무덤에서 경비병으로서 출몰하며, 무덤을 지킴에 있어서 그 무자비함을 보여준다. 드로거는 누군가가 우연히 만나지 않는 이상 휴면하는 경향이 있어서, 들어갈때 좁은 틈새나 석관을 주의하는 편이 좋다. 이 언데드는 재빠르고 조용히 움직이기 때문에, 항상 뒤를 조심해야 한다. 지나간 길 뒤쪽에서 시체가 갑자기 움직이기 시작하여 경고없이 당신을 덮칠지도 모른다.\n"
"\n"
"노드유적을 탐험하는 것으로 얻는 것도 있다. 큰 건조물의 매장실에는 어떤 종류의 보물이 들어있으며, 금화가 있거나, 마법이 걸린 무기나 방어구가 있는 경우도 있다. 유적안에 존재하는 의식용의 뼈단지는 결코 무시해서는 안 된다. 대부분의 경우 매우 가치가 있는 고대의 봉납물로 채워져 있다. 전부는 아닐지도 모르나, 대부분의 유적에는 큰 벽이 있어서, 마법의 비문이 쓰여있다고 하는 소문이 전해져 오고있으나, 사실인지의 여부는 확인되어 있지 않다.\n"
"\n"
"이 문서가 유적에 대한 종합적인 안내서라고 생각될지도 모르겠지만, 아직 발견되지 않은 것들 중에서도 틀림없이 위험이 잠복하고 있다. 무덤에 들어갈 때엔 항상 많은 장비와 도구, 그리고 튼튼한 무기를 준비해두지 않으면 안된다. 약간의 인내와 예리한 눈으로 주의하면서 슬그머니 걷다보면, 노드의 유적은 커다란 부를 가져다준다. 반면에 단순한 안전 대책을 게을리하면, 수많은 그 분야의 선구자들과 같이 영원히 갇혀 버릴수도 있다."

"The clans of the Nords spread across Skyrim like herds of mammoths, though their numbers and influence upon the land are far greater. Each clan, however, makes its mark in a different way. Some clans are known for their hunting skills, or their forestry, or their crafting. Some clans are large, others small. Some take a prominent role in government and community. And then there are the dark clans. The clans no one deals with or even speaks of. One such clan is the infamous Stormfists of Whiterun Tundra.\n"
"\n"
"The clan traces its lineage to Ogra Stormfist, the powerful matriarch who founded the clan and ruled over it for almost fifty years. Highly regarded for their combat skills and armor crafting, the Stormfist clan played pivotal roles in numerous conflicts over the centuries, including the Battle of Whiterun Hold, the Massacre at Dialmarch, and the Siege of Windhelm. It was the last engagement, however, that led to the clan's fall from favor and marked it as anathema.\n"
"\n"
"Prior to the Second Akaviri Invasion, Fildgor Strong-Prince, son of Queen Mabjaarn of Eastern Skyrim, went on a pilgrimage to the west to see the land and meet the people. He fell in with young men and women from the Stormfist clan and forged friendships and bonds that would serve him well in the coming years. When Fildgor was ready to move on and perform his coming-of-age trials, an entourage of Stormfist clan members decided to go with him. They became known as the Stormfist Brigade, and even though he wasn't a member of the clan by birth, Fildgor became their de facto leader.\n"
"\n"
"If the Stormfist clan had a reputation prior to this, it paled in comparison to the legend that grew around the Stormfist Brigade. They were ferocious warriors, setting off for adventure in the most hostile and isolated areas of the kingdom. With Fildgor leading the way, they routed bandits, uncovered treasure, and slew monsters. When the Akaviri invaders arrived in force, Fildgor led the Brigade into the thick of battle. They eventually fought their way to Windhelm to join forces with Queen Mabjaarn and the main army. \n"
"\n"
"Although they weren't able to stop the fall of Windhelm or save the queen, the Stormfist Brigade was nonetheless instrumental in helping to route the invading army. They marched as part of the combined Nord forces that eventually joined with the Dark Elves and Argonians to defeat the Akaviri. But then the fateful decision was made. When Fildgor declared his intention to ascend the throne left empty by his sister Nurnhilde's death, the Stormfist clan was among his most vocal backers. You know how that story ends. Jorunn and Fildgor met in single combat, and Jorunn won the throne. Fildgor was exiled, and he departed Skyrim with a promise to one day return.\n"
"\n"
"The Stormfist clan, loyal to Fildgor to the end, refused to bow before Jorunn or acknowledge his authority over them. They returned to their holdings to the west, and King Jorunn, tired of all the fighting, let them go. To this day, the Stormfist clan remains isolated, rarely venturing out of its domain or taking part in the larger Nord community. What will happen if the clan ever decides to to leave its tundra-lands and reassert its place among the other clans is anyone's guess. Especially if Fildgor ever makes good on his promise."

"Observations on the Giantish Peoples of Skyrim from the journals of Bonorion the Wanderer, 2E 569\n"
"\n"
"Having explored the snowy reaches of Eastmarch and the Rift, I have had opportunities to observe the strange and rather large people the Skyrim natives call \"giants.\" The natives of Skyrim are rather large themselves, but the giants that roam the wilderness are twice the size (or more!) of your average thick-necked, broad-shouldered Nord. Here are some observations, recorded for future travelers to this chilly clime:\n"
"\n"
"Giants are tall.\n"
"\n"
"Giants seem peaceful enough. Until you threaten them. Then they swing huge clubs and launch even a burly Nord over field and stream. The trip probably kills the Nord. That would be my guess, as I've never been able to interview a survivor of a giant's swing. \n"
"\n"
"Things that seem to threaten giants include, but are not limited to:  \n"
"      Going near them. \n"
"      Threatening their mammoths.\n"
"      Shooting arrows at them.\n"
"\n"
"No one that I have spoken to has ever seen a female giant or a young giant. Are giant children taller than Bosmer? Are female giants painfully shy? This calls for additional observation. \n"
"\n"
"Giants paint rocks and trees near their encampments. This primitive art probably entices the rare female giantess who might wander by. Or the decorations mark territory. Or the giants simply like to paint. This calls for further study.\n"

"The Wood Elf Bonorion was found at the base of large hill near the area known as Cradlecrush. Given the condition of his body, that is, every bone broken, it appears that he ignored his own advice. Even the dimmest Nord children know better than to approach a giant. As the nearest giant camp was nearly a league from where his body was found, I would say that Wood Elves can travel great distances when launched by a giant's club. \n"
"\n"
"I have preserved his journal as a cautionary tale for future explorers of Eastmarch, the Rift, and other regions where giants make their homes. Heed its advice, even if its author did not: don't try to befriend a giant."

"\n"
"A wide variety of spirits roam the lonely paths of Skyrim. Some are fierce and terrible, hateful and jealous of mortal creatures. Others are simply mischievous, full of playful wickedness that can turn dangerous if the target isn't completely aware of what's happening. A few can be benevolent, but even these can turn hostile if the proper decorum and respect aren't adhered to. These spirits range from free-roaming Daedra to the mortal dead to nature personified, though such distinctions may not matter much if you become embroiled in a haunted encounter. What do you care if the spirit harassing you is a marauding Daedra or the lingering shade of a village peasant? It's still just as insubstantial. It's still just as dangerous.\n"
"\n"
"The Haunted Wood, far to the south of Windhelm, has long been a place of mystery and danger. A multitude of stories describe how sparkling lights or compelling whispers lure travelers deep into the forest. Of even local farmers and loggers who should know better falling victim to strange sounds and even stranger sights that can occur when the sun rides high in the sky or when darkness covers the land.\n"
"\n"
"One such spirit is a guardian spirit tied to a specific natural landmark, such as a lake, a hill, or a copse of woods. The guardian spirit haunts the area it is connected to, and cannot abandon or wander far from the location. A guardian spirit might take on a mortal shape when appearing before mortal creatures, but make no mistake: these spirits were never mortal and are as different from the mortal world as the residents of Oblivion. They might imitate mortal behavior, but they neither understand it nor have any but the most tenuous connection to it.\n"
"\n"
"A guardian spirit might get bored with its routine. It might become curious about new creatures wandering into its environment. It might even become angry at a presumed slight by a mortal visiting its realm. Any or all of these situations might draw the attention of a guardian spirit upon you. Or it might be something else entirely that draws them to you. Who can tell what motivates these strange entities?\n"
"\n"
"The guardian spirit associated with the Haunted Wood tends to be curious and mischievous, but has rarely shown outright hostility to mortal visitors. Stories abound of missing objects, strange appearances, and playful teasing, but there are few accounts of the forest turning against mortal visitors. It seems that, for this spirit at least, some kind of connection is trying to be made. Or, perhaps, this too is a misinterpretation of intent. Perhaps this guardian spirit is simply attempting to lull visitors into letting their guard down. And then the spirit will pounce."

"\n"
"The Crown of Freydis, worn by our beloved Queen Mabjaarn, has a long history. Many know of the crown's famed beauty, but few know the true intent of the crown and why it was created—and that it was even worn by other monarchs before Queen Freydis. \n"
"\n"
"The Crown of Freydis is actually the second royal crown of Skyrim. The fabled Jagged Crown holds the distinction of being the first. The Jagged Crown was forged by Harald, first king of the Nords, from the bones of dragons. Legend has it that the Jagged Crown disappeared with the death of Harald's final descendant King Borgas in The Wild Hunt of 1E 369. The death of childless King Borgas, last of the line of Ysgramor, triggered an internecine conflict known as the War of Succession.\n"
"\n"
"The War of Succession raged for more than fifty years before Olaf One-Eye became the new High King of Skyrim. Olaf was elected to the position primarily due to the renown he garnered subduing the dragon Numinex, and not for any benevolence or statesmanship on his part. The rule of Olaf One-Eye was a time marked by great strife and division among the Nords. When he also died without a clear heir, it was decided that a new manner be employed for choosing a new High King. \n"
"\n"
"Each of Skyrim's holds sent a mage to a convocation called specifically to craft a magical artifact that would test the worth of potential candidates for High King. To this end, they created the Crown of Verity. Crafting the artifact in the shape of a crown was a brilliant innovation. With the loss of the Jagged Crown, Olaf had worn no mark of recognizable rulership. They felt that a new crown would help unify the realm behind a new king after the relative instability of Olaf's rule. The timing of the crown's creation proved to be auspicious.\n"
"\n"
"The Moot selected a tribal chieftain named Asurn Ice-Breaker to be the next High King of Skyrim. Asurn was a mighty warrior of unmatched skill in the vein of Olaf One-Eye, though he never defeated a dragon. Before he assumed the role, however, he had to don the newly-forged Crown of Verity. That's when the true power of the artifact became apparent.\n"
"\n"
"The crown rejected Asurn. It literally refused to be placed upon his head. In a rage, Asurn summoned his loyal followers and threatened to kill every member of the Moot if they didn't name him as the rightful king. He refused to be rejected by a crown. A soft-spoken member of the council rose from his chair. He challenged Asurn to combat, according to the law. The battle was short and to the point: Asurn was struck down. When the soft-spoken man took the crown and placed it easily upon his own head, a new High King of Skyrim was born. That was how Kjoric the White rose to power.\n"
"\n"
"To this day, the Crown of Freydis has been passed down from High King to High King. It is used as a tool by the Moot to ascertain the worthiness of any candidate for the throne. Since the day Asurn was struck down, no one has challenged the validity of the Crown or its powers—until 2E 431, when the Reman Empire fell asunder, and King Logrolf was assassinated. \n"
"\n"
"Jarl Svartr of Solitude claimed that Logrolf's daughter, Freydis, was illegitimate, and therefore a Moot was required to choose a successor. Though Freydis, wearing the Crown of Verity, was named High Queen in Windhelm, a partial Moot in Solitude chose Svartr as High King. Thereafter the West Kingdom was ruled by Svartr and his successors, while the East Kingdom was ruled by the heirs to Freydis, who renamed the Crown of Verity in her honor."

"\n"
"No pest has proven more resilient to the Nords of Skyrim than the common Orc. The tusked people claim occupancy of our fair realm, stretching back before the time Ysgramor crossed the Sea of Ghosts. Though few written accounts still exist of that time, there is mention in the histories of the Companions uprooting Orc strongholds even as they burned the Snow Elves from the land.\n"
"\n"
"Orc strongholds are well defended outposts often situated around deposits of mineral wealth. Each contains the infrastructure to support a dozen or more families, surrounded by walls designed to repel anything but the strongest martial force. Many jarls are remembered in song for dying vainly while attempting to root a stronghold from their lands. Worse, destroyed strongholds often return within a generation of their destruction if not countered by a Nord fort that needs a constant supply of troops and provisions. \n"
"\n"
"Few jarls can afford to defend piles of rock for more than a few years, and thus the Orc strongholds remain a pox upon our land. Some strongholds have persisted in this way for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. It's said that the ancient Orc stronghold of Cradlecrush in Eastmarch has never been taken by force or abandoned, despite the complete exhaustion of the mineral vein it sits upon.\n"
"\n"
"The height of Orcish power in Skyrim came with the establishment of Yashnag's Chiefdom in the early Second Era. With the destruction of Orsinium by the combined Breton and Redguard forces, the Orcs were scattered across the North in a great exodus. Yashnag and his people, exiled from High Rock, fled east to reclaim lands in Skyrim they felt were theirs by ancient right. The King of West Skyrim, Svartr, was ineffective in holding back the Orcs and the Reachmen that plagued the West Kingdom during his rule. The chiefdom was a bane upon Western Falkreath for more than thirty years, until it was burned out by Hakkvilld Yashnag-Slayer in the year 467 of the Second Era.\n"
"\n"
"Hakkvild became Jarl of Falkreath when Yashnag killed his father on the field of battle. The young jarl inherited little more than a crumbling hold largely occupied by Orcish invaders from the west. It is said that Hakkvild challenged Yashnag and a host of Yashnag's Orc champions to a ritual trial by combat. He defeated each in turn. How Hakkvild learned of this obscure Orcish ritual is not known, but with their leader's defeat, Yashnag's followers abandoned the chiefdom.\n"
"\n"
"With the destruction of the chiefdom, the Orcs scattered further into Skyrim or back into the mountains of Wrothgar. Orc clans descended from Yashnag's people have an intense hatred of the Kings of Skyrim. It's ironic that this enmity for the Nords has grown, even as the Orcs themselves have re-established ties with the peoples of western Tamriel that burned their first home hundreds of years ago."

"Some call them a cult. Others say worse things. But the Ternion Monks carry on a tradition that honors the Three Old Gods and the totems associated with them. While the religion is ancient, its followers are few. In many respects, the Ternion movement is slowly dying, as very little proselytizing takes place by the current contingent of monks. Fewer and fewer converts take up the worship of the Three Old Gods, and soon the religion may become nothing but a vague memory.\n"
"\n"
"Known for their healing magic, the Ternion Monks can call forth aspects of the Three Old Gods. With the help of these aspects, the monks can perform tasks beyond the scope of mere mortal limitations. The aspects take the forms of the Three Old Gods: the Fox, the Bear, and the Wolf.\n"
"\n"
"The Fox is crafty and quick, and its aspect enhances the speed and agility of the monks who call upon him.\n"
"\n"
"The Bear is strong, mighty. A protector. The aspect of the Bear enhances strength and shields those who call upon him from harm.\n"
"\n"
"The Wolf is sly and observant, ferocious and deadly. She watches and waits, looking for the best opportunity to make her move. The aspect of the Wolf enhances vision and perception, allowing those who call upon her to see more clearly, to notice the hidden and the obscure.\n"
"\n"
"The Ternion Monks prefer nigh-inaccessible spots as places to meditate and worship. Often, the only way to get to these holy retreats is to use the magic of the monks. A guardian is always appointed to open the way to the retreat, but will only do so for other monks or if the need is great and the requester is worthy.\n"
"\n"
"I have spent time with the monks, learned something of their ways and seen their healing magic in action. I believe that they are good people, following a worthy tradition. But I fear that when this generation comes to an end, the Ternion Monks and the Three Old Gods they worship will fade away.\n"

"The Akaviri land their ships in force. Several have been turned away or sunk, but more slip past our guard. Our forces move forward to meet them on the cliffs above the beaches, where we hold the high ground.\n"
"\n"
"From our vantage point, the queen watches their approach. She will get to see firsthand the ferocity and strength of the Blood Claws!\n"
"\n"
"8 Sun's Height\n"
"\n"
"The Akaviri ships have dropped anchor back from the beach. Perhaps they fear our blades. I say let them starve themselves in their ships, but Princess Nurnhilde believes they plot, rather than cower. She is wiser than I, so I have sent scouts to find and foil any cowardly, underhanded tactics they might be ready to deploy.\n"
"\n"
"19 Sun's Height\n"
"\n"
"More than a week, and still the Akaviri do not attack. The soldiers grow restless, and Princess Nurnhilde broods. Scouts have returned without any information. Still, I continue to send them out day after day. None have spoken against me, but I see their looks as I order yet another patrol along the beaches.\n"
"\n"
"The Blood Claws were made for slaughter, not waiting.\n"
"\n"
"22 Sun's Height\n"
"\n"
"Arguments and fighting in the camp, and the Akaviri still wait with their fleet, just beyond of our grasp. We've heard reports of attacks north and south of us, along the coast, even as far south as the Dark Elf lands. The troops wonder why we wait when fighting takes place elsewhere. And wonder begins to turn to anger.\n"
"\n"
"Princess Nurnhilde insists that this is their main fleet, and that they are trying to lure us away from our position. When she speaks, the soldiers become calm and thoughtful. She cuts right through their anger and bitterness. I wish she would address them more often.\n"
"\n"
"26 Sun's Height\n"
"\n"
"An Akaviri ship landed today. It hit the beach in the darkness just before morning. Our soldiers surrounded it, expecting a hail of arrows from within, but none came. It was odd that such a large ship beached itself, but the troops were bored and hungry for blood. The magical traps on the ship claimed the lives of seven warriors.\n"
"\n"
"I have never seen the troops so angry. Even the Princess had trouble calming them. When the Akaviri land, they will be torn to shreds. If we don't tear ourselves apart first, that is.\n"
"\n"
"29 Sun's Height\n"
"\n"
"Reports of the Dark Elf lands being overrun. There is little love lost between Nords and Dark Elves, but at this moment we share the frustration they must feel. The report talks of Akaviri in their fields, and our warriors hunger for combat.\n"
"\n"
"I spoke with the Princess. I told her this news may have pushed the Blood Claws to a new level of rage. She said nothing, only pressed her lips together. She's always several steps ahead of the rest of us, and I fear she has seen something I have yet to notice.\n"
"\n"
"2 Last Seed\n"
"\n"
"The Akaviri landed this morning, a massive wave of destruction crashing upon the beach. Our soldiers were whipped into a frenzy as the call to arms rang out. They were reckless, and the first rush was cut down by archers before a proper line could be formed. Our recklessness cost us the beach, and the invaders now have a foothold in our land.\n"
"\n"
"3 Last Seed\n"
"\n"
"We had to fall back. Fighting was too intense and Princess Nurnhilde ordered the troops back to Windhelm. We'll fight from the walls and use the strength of the city to crush the invaders once and for all!\n"
"\n"
"4 Last Seed\n"
"\n"
"Tension runs high tonight, as we wait for the Akaviri to press forward. I saw Nurnhilde donning armor. The Blood Claws will follow her, listen to her orders like the voice of the Dragon itself, but the risk is so great. Word has come to us the princes are nearby, fighting their way to the city. I pray they arrive in time to help.\n"
"\n"
"7 Last Seed\n"
"\n"
"Queen Mabjaarn and Princess Nurnhilde are dead. Nurnhilde led the Blood Claws into combat when the gates of Windhelm fell. They fought like I have never seen anyone fight before, raging in perfect coordination. When the queen went down, the rage took over, though Nurnhilde donned the crown and try to restore order to our lines. The Akaviri were driven from the city. They thought to goad us, and they did, but the beast they awoke was more than they could handle.\n"
"\n"
"But then they came back. Now Queen Nurnhilde is dead. I should have been able to command my warriors, control them. It should have been me, not her. The responsibility for their deaths is mine, and I will explain that to the princes personally."

"At the height of the Akaviri Invasion, in 2E 572, the twin brothers of Princess Nurnhilde, Jorunn the Skald Prince and Fildgor Strong Prince (also called Fildgor Angry Prince, but never to his face), were in two very different locations. Jorunn was in Riften with his closest companions, the Pack of Bards. Fildgor, meanwhile, was on the northeast coast of Skyrim, fighting alongside his sister when the Akaviri of Dir-Kamal launched their assault. As the Akaviri made their way toward Windhelm, Jorunn and his companions forged their own path toward the fabled Nord city.\n"
"\n"
"Fildgor, meanwhile, demonstrated his fighting prowess, as well as his exalted anger, over and over again as the battle for the coast raged on. He often led his own team of companions, the Stormfist Brigade, which consisted of members of the Stormfist clan. They had fought beside Fildgor during his pilgrimage and coming-of-age trials, and were devoted to the Strong-Prince.\n"
"\n"
"Jorunn and Fildgor, along with their closest comrades, each arrived in time to see the gates of Windhelm break wide. The brothers fought valiantly, but they couldn't prevent the fall of the city or the death of Queens Mabjaarn and Nurnhilde (\"The Brief Queen\"), who died defending the palace and the people they loved. The twins, who hadn't been close for several years, nonetheless fell into familiar companionship and joined forces to repel the invaders. Thanks to Jorunn's alliance with the Dark Elves and the unexpected but welcome assistance of the Argonians, the Akaviri invasion was at last crushed.\n"
"\n"
"As Jorunn and his forces returned to Windhelm, Fildgor stepped forward to claim rulership. The crisis was over, and he decided to push his claim. He expected Jorunn to acquiesce, as his brother usually did in the face of Fildgor's anger and unrestrained passion. But Jorunn refused. The Skald Prince decided to become the Skald King, for he had seen what Fildgor's passions were capable of. In war, he wanted Fildgor at his side. But as a leader for his people? Jorunn didn't really want to sit upon the throne, but he felt he had no choice. He didn't believe Fildgor would be a good ruler for his people.\n"
"\n"
"Enraged by Jorunn's defiance, Fildgor rallied the Stormfist clan and other supporters he had throughout the realm. After all, he was a true Nord warrior, not a singer and scholar like his brother. Jorunn saw that the kingdom was headed for civil war, so he challenged Fildgor to single combat. The Strong Prince smiled, confident he could defeat his bard of a brother easily. He accepted, and the longest three hours in recent history began. The brothers' war was on.\n"
"\n"
"The two brothers fought in the square outside the battle-damaged palace. The fight was brutal and long. Weapons clashed, parried, came together, moved apart, and drew blood. When it appeared that neither brother was going to gain the upper hand before they both collapsed from sheer exhaustion, Jorunn called upon reserves no one expected him to possess. He struck Fildgor's weapon, shattering it. Then he knocked Fildgor flat and demanded his surrender.\n"
"\n"
"With no other option available, Fildgor surrendered. But his hatred burned and his rage surrounded him like a roiling storm. With a broken heart, Jorunn exiled his brother and chastened the Stormfist clan for supporting him. Fildgor cursed Jorunn's name and departed. While the Skald King went on to prove himself a capable and beloved ruler, the Strong Prince was rumored to have fled to the lands of the Daggerfall Covenant. Perhaps one day, the brothers' war will resume."

"\n"
"The Dwarves have been extinct for many an age, and perhaps that's for the best. To see men and women the size of large children, all with beards, would be a most disturbing sight. Still, whatever wrath the Dwarves brought from the gods that consumed an entire civilization surely must have been an awe-inspiring thing to witness.\n"
"\n"
"The remnants of their civilization lie buried in the hearts of mountains. Scholars and thieves the world over descend on the skeletal remains of Dwarven cities like vultures to scrape clean the bones of the past, old knowledge waiting to be exhumed, and treasures to be discovered. But many men lie murdered in those halls of the damned, because those Dwarven ruins do not release their treasures without a fight.\n"
"\n"
"My kin would tell stories long ago, when I was just a child, about how adept the Dwarves were at building machines. They would say that before our time, Dwarves harnessed the power of the earth. They wielded fire and hammers to reshape steel and bronze with a mechanical brilliance that breathed life into these now ancient constructs of metal and magic. In their dark halls and chambers, amid the ceaseless droning of grinding gears and venting steam, they lie in wait to confound or destroy would-be plunderers of the Dwarven sanctums, as the grim watchmen of the last vestiges of culture from a dead race.\n"
"\n"
"I descended into the humid darkness of Mzulft. The slow hiss of steam, creaking of metal, and rattle of old gears powering an empty city would unnerve most men. I could hear things in the darkness, skittering across the floor just out of sight as I stepped over the bodies of plunderers or scholars who had not made it far. I knew it was not rats wandering these halls.\n"
"\n"
"Small mechanical spiders set upon me with rapid movements. Machines sprouted from the walls and uncurled from spheres into contraptions that rolled on top of gears for legs and crossbows for arms. I could not help but marvel at these single purpose machines built for the murder of men. My sword and my shield are my strength, and I am undeterred by such things. I had heard of greater things roaming these depths, and indeed, something else in these chambers stirred, and it echoed with massive weight. As it lumbered closer, its feet struck the ground as if walking on massive pistons. As it loomed out of darkness, I could see it clear for the first time, axe for one hand, hammer for the other, as tall as five men, made of dull bronze with a face molded in the image of its masters. A Steam Centurion. The stories were true. These were the guardians of the greatest Dwarven treasures. \n"
"\n"
"We fought, and the Dwarves must truly be extinct, because our battle was surely booming enough to wake the dead. It came at me with hammer and axe, inhuman strength, great fortitude, and a purpose of nothing but murder. I dodged as it crushed the stone around me with futile strikes. I thrust and slashed at it with my blade and took every opening afforded as we shook the halls with violence. I refuse to be undone by a machine.\n"
"\n"
"Where the average man would be long dead, I stood over the husk of this dead automaton, its steam escaping like a final gasp. I could have taken the Dwarven artifacts and metal, but I left them there for others, for I would not hex my journey with the possessions of dead men. Maybe that is where countless others go wrong.\n"
"\n"
"I will continue on my journey across the lands. Perhaps one day Herebane will meet a worthy challenge, for I have yet to see what would make me tremble."

"The Dowry\n"
"\n"
"By Marobar Sul\n"
"\n"
"Ynaleigh was the wealthiest landowner in Gunal, and over the years, he had saved a tremendous dowry for the man who would marry his daughter, Genefra. When she reached the age of consent, he locked the gold away for safe-keeping and announced his intention to have her marry. She was a comely lass, a scholar, a great athlete, but dour and brooding in aspect. This personality defect did not bother her potential suitors any more than her positive traits impressed them. Every man knew the tremendous wealth that would be his as the husband of Genefra and son-in-law of Ynaleigh. That alone was enough for hundreds to come to Gunal to pay court.\n"
"\n"
"\"The man who will marry my daughter,\" said Ynaleigh to the assembled, \"must not be doing so purely out of avarice. He must demonstrate his own wealth to my satisfaction.\"\n"
"\n"
"This simple pronouncement removed a vast majority of the suitors, since they knew they could not impress the landowner with their meager fortunes. A few dozen did come forward within a few days, clad in fine killarc cloth of spun silver, accompanied by exotic servants, traveling in magnificent carriages. All who came who met with Ynaleigh's approval, but none arrived in a more resplendent fashion than Welyn Naerillic. The young man, whom no one had ever heard of, arrived in a shining ebon coach drawn by a team of dragons, his clothing of rarest manufacture. He was accompanied by an army of the most fantastical servants any of Gunal had ever seen. His valets had eyes on all sides of their heads, and his maidservants seemed cast in gemstones.\n"
"\n"
"Such was not enough for Ynaleigh.\n"
"\n"
"\"The man who marries my daughter must prove himself an intelligent fellow, for I would not have an ignoramus as a son-in-law and business partner,\" he declared.\n"
"\n"
"This eliminated a large part of the wealthy suitors. Through their lives of luxury, they had never needed to think very much, if at all. Still, some came forward over the next few days, demonstrating their wit and learning, quoting the great sages of the past and offering their philosophies of metaphysics and alchemy. Welyn Naerillic also came and asked Ynaleigh to dine at the villa he had rented outside of Gunal. There, the landowner saw scores of scribes working on translations of Aldmeri tracts and enjoyed the young man's somewhat irreverent but intriguing intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"Nevertheless, though he was much impressed with Welyn Naerillic, Ynaleigh had another challenge.\n"
"\n"
"\"I love my daughter very much,\" said Ynaleigh, \"and I hope that the man who marries her will make her happy as well. Should any of you make her smile, she and the great dowry are yours.\"\n"
"\n"
"The suitors lined up for days, singing her songs, proclaiming their devotion, describing her beauty in the most poetic of terms. Genefra merely glared at all with hatred and melancholia. Ynaleigh stood by her side and began to despair. His daughter's suitors were failing to a man. Finally Welyn Naerillic came to the chamber.\n"
"\n"
"\"I will make your daughter smile,\" he said. \"I dare say, I'll make her laugh, but only after you've agreed to marry us. If she is not delighted within one hour of our engagement, the wedding can be called off.\"\n"
"\n"
"Ynaleigh turned to his daughter. She was not smiling, but her eyes had sparked with some morbid curiosity in this young man. As no other suitor had even registered that for her, he agreed.\n"
"\n"
"\"The dowry is naturally not to be paid 'til after you've wed,\" said Ynaleigh. \"Being engaged is not enough.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Might I see the dowry still?\" asked Welyn.\n"
"\n"
"Knowing how fabled the treasure was and understanding that this would likely be the closest the young man would come to possessing it, Ynaleigh agreed. He had grown quite found of Welyn. On his orders, Welyn, Ynaleigh, glum Genefra, and the castellan delved deeply into the stronghold of Gunal. The first vault had to be opened by touching a series of runic symbols. Should one of the marks be activated incorrectly, a volley of poisoned arrows would have struck the thief. Ynaleigh was particularly proud of the next level of security: a lock composed of blades with eighteen tumblers that required three keys to be turned simultaneously. The blades were designed to eviscerate any who merely picked one of the locks. Finally, they reached the storeroom.\n"
"\n"
"It was entirely empty.\n"
"\n"
"\"By Lorkhan, we've been burgled!\" cried Ynaleigh. \"But how? Who could have done this?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"A humble but, if I may say so, rather talented burglar,\" said Welyn. \"A man who has loved your daughter from afar for many years, but did not possess the glamor or the learning to impress. That is, until the gold from her dowry afforded me the opportunity.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"You?\" bellowed Ynaleigh, scarcely able to believe it. Then something even more unbelievable happened.\n"
"\n"
"Genefra began to laugh. She had never even dreamed of meeting anyone like this thief. She threw herself into his arms before her father's outraged eyes. After a moment, Ynaleigh began to laugh as well.\n"
"\n"
"Genefra and Welyn were married in a month's time. Though he was in fact quite poor and had little scholarship, Ynaleigh was amazed how much his wealth increased with such a son-in-law and business partner.\n"
"\n"
"He made certain never to ask from whence the excess gold came."

" 이넬리 (Ynaleigh)는 구날 (Gunal)에서 가장 부유한 지주였으며, 그는 수년에 걸쳐 그의 딸 게네프라 (Genefra)와 결혼할 남자에게 줄 막대한 양의 지참금을 모아두었다. 게네프라가 결혼할 나이가 되자, 이넬리는 그 동안 그가 모았던 지참금을 그의 금고 깊숙히 넣어 안전하게 보관하고는 그녀를 결혼시킬 예정이라고 발표하였다. 그녀는 모범생에다가, 운동도 상당히 잘 하는 참한 아가씨였으나, 한편으로는 시무룩하고 음울한 면도 조금 있었다. 하지만 이 성격의 결함은 그녀의 장점을 생각할 때, 그녀의 구혼자들에게 아무런 흠이 되지 않았다. 모든 남자가 게네프라의 남편과 이넬리의 사위로서 누리게 될 막대한 부를 알고 있었다. 이 사실 하나만으로도 수백명의 남자들이 그녀에게 청혼을 하기 위해 구날로 모여들었다.\n"
"\n"
"\"나의 딸과 결혼하게 될 남자는,\" 모여든 청혼자들에게 이넬리가 말했다. \"순수하게 탐욕없이 청혼하지는 않았을 것이다. 모든 청혼자는 내가 만족할 만큼의 부를 소유하고 있음을 내게 보여야 할 것이다.\"\n"
"\n"
"그들의 얼마되지 않는 부로 이 대지주의 눈에 들 수는 없다는 것을 아는 대부분의 구혼자들이 이 간단한 공표를 듣고는 청혼을 포기했다. 며칠 뒤, 수십 명의 청혼자가 다시 나타났다. 이들은 은으로 된 실로 지은 훌륭한 킬아크 옷을 걸치고, 이국적인 하인들을 대동했으며, 커다랗고 호화로운 마차를 타고 있었다. 하지만 다시 찾아와 이넬리의 환영을 받은 모든 이들 중 그 누구도 웰린 네릴릭 (Welyn Naerillic) 보다 화려하게 빛나지는 못했다. 이 젊은이는, 누구도 이제까지 그 이름을 들어본 적이 없었는데, 흑단으로 만들어졌으며 드래곤들이 무리를 지어 끄는 눈부신 대형 4륜 마차를 타고 도착했다. 그의 옷은 가장 희귀한 상품이었고, 구날의 누구도 본 적이 없는 가장 기이하고 환상적인 하인 무리를 대동하고 있었다. 종자들은 머리의 모든 편에 눈이 달려 있는 듯 했으며, 여종들은 마치 보석으로 만들어진 듯 했다.\n"
"\n"
"하지만 이것만으로는 이넬리을 만족시킬 수 없었다.\n"
"\n"
"\"나의 딸과 결혼할 남자는 그가 현명한 사람을 증명해야 한다. 나는 사위이자 사업 동반자로 무지한 사람을 들이지 않을 것이기 때문이다.\" 그가 선언했다.\n"
"\n"
"이 선언에, 그들이 누리는 호화로운 삶 속에서 생각을 많이하고 살 필요가 없던 부유한 청혼자의 많은 수가 떨어져 나갔다. 하지만 몇몇은 그 이후로 며칠 동안 이넬리를 찾아와, 그들의 재치와 지식을 뽐내며, 과거의 가장 위대했던 현자의 말을 인용하고 그들의 형이상학적 철학과 연금술을 논하였다. 웰린 네릴릭도 이넬리를 방문하여 그가 구날 외곽에 빌려둔 저택에서 식사를 청하였다. 대지주는 거기에서 알드메리 소논문을 번역하고 있는 수많은 필기자들을 보았으며, 이 젊은이의 다소 불손하지만 흥미를 불러일으키는 식견을 즐겼다.\n"
"\n"
"하지만 그가 웰린 넬리릭에게 상당한 감명을 받았음에도 불구하고, 이넬리는 청혼자들에게 다른 하나의 과제를 제시하였다.\n"
"\n"
"\"나는 나의 딸을 매우 사랑한다네.' 이넬리가 말했다. \"그리고 난 나의 딸과 결혼할 남자가 그녀를 마찬가지로 행복하게 해주길 바라지. 자네들 중 나의 딸을 웃게하는 자가 있다면, 그녀와 막대한 지참금은 그의 것이네\"\n"
"\n"
"청혼자들은 며칠동안 줄을 섰다. 그들은 그녀에게 노래를 부르고, 그들이 그녀를 헌신적으로 대할 것임을 선언하고, 가장 시적인 단어들을 골라 그녀의 아름다움을 묘사하였다. 하지만 게네프라는 단지 우울함과 증오가 섞인 눈길로 그들을 노려보기만 했을 뿐이었다. 그녀의 옆에 자리하던 이넬리는 결국 절망하고 말았다. 이 과제에서 청혼자들은 그를 실망시키고 있었다. 마침내 웰린 네릴릭이 방 안으로 들어왔다.\n"
"\n"
"\"제가 당신의 딸을 웃도록 하겠습니다.\" 그가 말했다. \"감히 말하건데, 저는 그녀가 큰 소리로 웃게 하겠습니다. 하지만 당신이 우리의 결혼을 승락한 뒤에 말이지요. 만약 그녀가 우리의 약혼 이후 한 시간 안에 기뻐서 웃지 않는다면, 결혼식을 취소해 버리면 될 것입니다.\"\n"
"\n"
"이넬리는 그의 돌아서서 그의 딸을 보았다. 그의 딸은 웃고 있지 않았지만, 그녀의 눈은 이 남자에 대한 소름끼치는 호기심으로 번뜩이고 있었다. 이제까지 그 어떤 청혼자에게도 그녀가 이 정도의 관심을 표한 적이 없었기에, 그는 동의하였다.\n"
"\n"
"\"자네가 내 딸과 결혼하기 전까지는 지참금을 지불하지 않는 것이 당연하다네.\" 이넬리가 말했다. \"약혼한 것만으로는 충분하다고 할 수 없지.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"그렇다면 지참금을 한 번 구경할 수는 있을런지요?\" 웰린이 물었다.\n"
"\n"
"이넬리는 이 보물이 어느 정도나 많이 사람들 입에 오르내리는가를 알고 있었고, 이 젊은이가 보물을 소유할 가능성이 가장 높은 사람이라는 것을 떠올리고는, 이에 동의하였다. 그는 웰린이 차츰 마음에 들기 시작했던 것이다. 그의 명령에 따라, 웰린, 이넬리, 우울한 게네프라 그리고 성주가 구날의 성채 깊숙한 곳을 더듬어 내려갔다. 첫 번째 금고는 일련의 룬 문양을 건드려야 문이 열리게 되어 있었다: 하나의 문양이라도 잘못 누를 경우에는, 독이 발라진 화살들이 일제히 날아와 도둑을 막을 것이다. 이넬리는 특별히 그 다음에 있는 보안을 자랑스럽게 여겼다. -- 열 여덟개의 큰 잔 모양으로 구성된 자물쇠는 칼날이 달려 있었으며, 세 개의 열쇠를 동시에 돌려야만 열 수 있도록 고안되어 있었다. 그저 하나의 자물쇠만을 열어버린 경우 칼날들이 튀어나와 그 사람의 내장을 제거해 버리도록 설계되어 있었다. 마침내, 그들은 저장실에 들어섰다.\n"
"\n"
"그곳은 완전히 비어 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"\"로칸이시여, 우리가 도둑을 맞았다니!\" 이넬리가 울부짖었다. \"하지만 어떻게? 누가 이런 짓을 할 수 있단 말인가?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"감히 제가 한 말씀 올려도 된다면, 상당히 재능있는 도둑일 것입니다.\" 웰린이 말했다. \"당신의 딸을 멀리서 오랫동안 사랑해왔지만, 화려한 부도 가지지 못했고 상대를 압도하는 법도 배우지 못했던 남자이지요. 즉, 그녀의 지참금에서 나온 그 재물이 저에게 기회를 주기 전까지는 말입니다.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"자네라고?\" 거의 믿을 수 없다는 표정으로 이넬리가 고함쳤다. 그리고는 더욱 믿을 수 없는 일이 일어났다.\n"
"\n"
"게네프라가 소리내어 웃기 시작한 것이다. 그녀는 자신이 웰린과 같은 이런 도둑을 만나게 될 것이라고는 꿈에도 생각하지 못했던 것이다. 아버지의 분노한 눈을 뒤로 하고, 그녀는 그의 양 팔에 몸을 던져 안겼다. 잠시 후, 이넬리도 역시 웃기 시작했다.\n"
"\n"
"게네프라와 웰린은 한달 정도의 시간이 흐른 뒤 결혼했다. 비록 웰린이 사실은 상당히 가난했고 교육도 거의 받지 못했음에도 불구하고, 이넬리는 그의 사위이자 사업 동반자인 웰린이 본인의 부를 어느 정도나 불렸는지에 대해 놀랐다.\n"
"\n"
"그는 늘어난 금이 어디서 온 것인지에 대해서는 절대로 묻지 말아달라고만 했으며, 이에 대한 언급은 일체 하지 않았다."

"Chimarvamidium\n"
"\n"
"By Marobar Sul\n"
"\n"
"After many battles, it was clear who would win the war. The Chimer had great skills in magic and swordplay, but against the armored battalions of the Dwemer clad in the finest shielding wrought by Jnaggo, there was little hope of their ever winning. In the interests of keeping some measure of peace in the Land, Sthovin the Warlord agreed to a truce with Karenithil Barif the Beast. In exchange for the Disputed Lands, Sthovin gave Barif a mighty golem that would protect the Chimer's territory from the excursions of the Northern Barbarians.\n"
"\n"
"Barif was delighted with his gift and brought it back to his camp, where all his warriors gaped in awe at it. Sparkling gold in hue, it resembled a Dwemer cavalier with a proud aspect. To test its strength, they placed the golem in the center of an arena and flung magical bolts of lightning at it. Its agility was such that few of the bolts struck it. It had the wherewithal to pivot on its hips to avoid the brunt of the attacks without losing its balance, feet firmly planted on the ground. A volley of fireballs followed, which the golem ably dodged, bending its knees and its legs to spin around the blasts. The few times it was struck, it made certain to be hit in the chest and waist, the strongest parts of its body.\n"
"\n"
"The troops cheered at the sight of such an agile and powerful creation. With it leading the defense, the Barbarians of Skyrim would never again successfully raid their villages. They named it Chimarvamidium, the Hope of the Chimer.\n"
"\n"
"Barif had the golem brought to his chambers with all his housethanes. There they tested Chimarvamidium further, its strength, its speed, its resiliency. They could find no flaw with its design.\n"
"\n"
"\"Imagine when the naked barbarians first meet this on one of their raids,\" laughed one of the housethanes.\n"
"\n"
"\"It is only unfortunate that it resembles a Dwemer instead of one of our own,\" mused Karenithil Barif. \"It is revolting to think that they will have a greater respect for our other enemies than us.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I think we should never accepted the peace terms that we did,\" said another, one of the most aggressive of the housethanes. \"Is it too late to surprise the warlord Sthovin with an attack?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"It is never too late to attack,\" said Barif, \"but what of his great armored warriors?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I understand,\" said Barif's spymaster, \"that his soldiers always wake at dawn. If we strike an hour before, we can catch them defenseless before they've had a chance to bathe, let alone don their armor.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"If we capture their armorer Jnaggo, then we too would know the secrets of blacksmith,\" said Barif. \"Let it be done. We will attack tomorrow, an hour before dawn.\"\n"
"\n"
"So it was settled. The Chimer army marched at night and swarmed into the Dwemer camp. They were relying on Chimarvamidium to lead the first wave, but it malfunctioned and began attacking the Chimer's own troops. Added to that, the Dwemer were fully armored, well-rested, and eager for battle. The surprise was turned, and most of the high-ranking Chimer, including Karenithil Barif the Beast, were captured.\n"
"\n"
"Though they were too proud to ask, Sthovin explained to them that he had been warned of their attack by a Calling from one of his men.\n"
"\n"
"\"What man of yours is in our camp?\" sneered Barif.\n"
"\n"
"Chimarvamidium, standing erect by the side of the captured, removed its head. Within its metal body was Jnaggo, the armorer.\n"
"\n"
"\"A Dwemer child of eight can create a golem,\" he explained, \"but only a truly great warrior and armorer can pretend to be one.\""

" 여러 번의 전투 후, 이 전쟁의 승자가 누구인지 확실해졌다. 카이머는 마법과 검술이 매우 뛰어났지만, 즈나고 가 만든 최고의 방어구로 무장한 드웨머의 군세 앞에서, 그들에게 승리에 대한 희망은 거의 없었다. 대륙의 평화를 유지하기 위해, 군사 지도자 스토빈  과 괴수 카레니딜 바리프는 휴전할 것에 동의했다. 분쟁 지역의 교환조건으로 스토빈은 바리프에게, 부쪽의 야만부족이 공격해올 때 카이머의 땅을 지켜줄 것이라며 강력한 골렘을 주었다.\n"
"\n"
"바리프는 그의 선물에 매우 기뻐하며 그것을 그의 주둔지로 가지고 갔는데, 그 때 그의 전사들은 골렘의 위압적인 모습에 경악했다. 황금빛으로 번쩍거리는 그것은, 긍지의 상징인 드웨머 기사와 닮았다. 그 힘을 시험하고자, 그들은 그 골렘을 아레나의 중앙에 놓고선 골렘을 향해 라이트닝 볼트 마법을 쏘았다. 골렘의 민첩함은 엄청나서 극소수의 볼트만이 그것을 맞출 수 있었다. 골렘은 자신의 둔부를 중심에 두고, 발은 땅 위에 굳건히 선 채로 균형을 잃는 일 없이 공격의 예봉을 피했다. 단숨에 여러 발의 파이어볼이 뒤따랐는데, 골렘은 교묘하게 피한 뒤 무릎과 다리를 굽혀 폭발을 피했다. 가끔 골렘이 공격을 받았을 때는 그 신체 중 가장 강한 부분인 가슴과 허리 부분에만 맞도록 했다.\n"
"\n"
"군중은 그 재빠르고 강력한 창조물을 보며 환호했다. 골렘을 수비에 내세운다면 스카이림의 야만인들은 절대로 그들의 마을을 습격할 수 없을 것이었다. 그들은 그 골렘에게 '카이머의 희망'이라는 뜻인 치마바미디움 이라는 이름을 지어주었다.\n"
"\n"
"바리프는 자신의 식솔들과 함께 그 골렘을 가지고 자신의 저택으로 돌아왔다. 그곳에서 그들은 치마바미디움애 대한 실험을 계속하여, 골렘의 힘과 속도, 골렘의 탄성과 같은 것을 시험했다. 그들은 골렘의 설계에 대해 아무런 결함도 발견할 수 없었다.\n"
"\n"
"\"발가벗은 야만인 놈들이 습격했을 때 이놈과의 첫 대면을 상상해보라고.\" 그의 식솔들 중 하나가 흥겨워하며 말했다.\n"
"\n"
"\"이것이 우리들보다 드웨머를 닮았다는 점이 유감이다.\" 카레니딜 바리프가 혼잣말을 했다. \"놈들이 우리보다 우리의 또 다른 적인 드웨머를 더 무서워하게 될 거란 생각을 하니 불쾌하군.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"제 생각엔, 그 평화협정은 절대로 해선 안 되는 것이었습니다.\" 식솔 중 가장 강경한 사람이 말했다. \"지금 스토빈을 습격하기에는 늦었을까요?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"공격하는 것은 문제없지.\" 바리프가 말했다. \"하지만 그의 중무장한 전사들은 어쩌고?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"좋은 생각이 있습니다.\" 바리프의 첩보단장이 말했다. \"그의 전사들은 항상 동틀 녘에 일어납니다. 우리가 그보다 한 시간 전에 공격을 가한다면, 놈들이 씻을 시간도 없이 방어구를 입지 못하고 무방비한 상태에서 놈들을 잡을 수 있습니다.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"우리가 그들의 병기 제조가인 즈나고를 잡으면, 우리도 그들의 제련술에 대한 비밀을 알 수 있게 될 것이다.\" 바리프가 말했다. \"끝장을 내자. 내일, 동틀 녘으로부터 한 시간 전에 공격을 가한다.\"\n"
"\n"
"이렇게 습격이 결정되었다. 카이머 군대는 한밤중에 행군하여 드웨머의 주둔지 부근에 모였다. 그들은 치마바미디움에 의지하여 첫 공격에 그것을 앞장세우기로 했는데, 갑자기 그 골렘이 오작동을 일으키고 카이머 자신들의 군대를 공격하기 시작했다. 엎친 데 덮친 격으로, 드웨머들은 완전 무장한 상태였고, 편히 쉰 뒤였으며, 싸움에 굶주려 있었다. 그들은 역으로 기습을 당했고, 카레니딜 바리프를 포함한 대부분의 고위급 카이머들은 생포되었다.\n"
"\n"
"그들은 자존심이 너무 강해서 질문을 하지 않았지만, 스토빈이 그들에게 설명해주었다. 그의 신하 중 하나가 부름 (the Calling)을 이용하여 그들의 공격에 대해 사전에 경고해 주었다는 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"\"우리 주둔지에 무슨 네놈의 신하가 있었다고?\" 바리프가 비웃었다.\n"
"\n"
"잡힌 자들과 함께 서 있던 치마바미디움이 머리 부분을 떼어내었다. 그 금속 신체 속에는 병기 제조가인 즈나고가 들어가 있었던 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"\"드웨머는 8살짜리 꼬마도 골렘을 만들 수 있지만,\" 그가 말했다. \"진정으로 위대한 전사와 병기 제조가만이 자신을 골렘처럼 보이도록 꾸밀 수 있는 능력을 가졌다.\"\n"

"\"When is not important,\" said Joltereg. \"Where is all that is important.\"\n"
"\n"
"So Fangbith took his Zolic cudgel in hand and walked far through the dark forest until he came to the base of the Great Mountain. There he met two monsters. One, bloodied with the flesh of the chieftain of Othrobar's flock, fought him while its mate fled. Fangbith remembered what his master had taught him, that \"where\" was all that was important.\n"
"\n"
"He struck the monster on each of its five vital points: head, groin, throat, back, and chest. With five blows to the five points, the monster was slain. It was too heavy to carry with him, but still triumphant, Fangbith returned to Othrobar.\n"
"\n"
"\"I say I have slain the monster that ate your flock,\" he cried.\n"
"\n"
"\"What proof have you that you have slain a monster?\" asked the chieftain.\n"
"\n"
"\"I say I have saved the flock with my medicine,\" said Ghorick the Healer.\n"
"\n"
"\"I say the Goddess has saved the flock by my sacrifices,\" said Beran the Priest.\n"
"\n"
"Two mornings went by and the flocks were safe, but on the morning of the third day, another tenfold of the chieftain's flock was found butchered. Ghorick the Healer went to his study to find a new medicine. Beran the Priest prepared more sacrifices. Fangbith took his Zolic cudgel in hand again, and he walked far through the dark forest until he came to the base of the Great Mountain. There he met the other monster, bloodied with the flesh of the chieftain of Othrobar's flock. They did battle, and again Fangbith remembered what his master had taught him, that \"where\" was all that was important.\n"
"\n"
"He struck the monster five times on the head and it fled. Chasing it along the mountain, he struck it five times in the groin and it fled. Running through the forest, Fangbith overtook the monster and struck it five times in the throat and it fled. Entering into the fields of Othrobar, Fangbith overtook the monster and struck it five times in the back and it fled. At the foot of the stronghold, the chieftain and his wise men emerged to the sound of the monster wailing. There they beheld the monster that had slain the chieftain's flock. Fangbith struck the monster five times in the chest and it was slain.\n"
"\n"
"A great feast was held in Fangbith's honor, and the flock of Othrobar was never again slain. Joltereg embraced his student and said, \"You have at last learned the importance of where you strike your blows.\""

"The Seed\n"
"\n"
"The hamlet village of Lorikh was a quiet, peaceful Dwemer community nestled in the grey and tan dunes and boulders of the Dejasyte. No vegetation of any kind grew in Lorikh, though there were blackened vestiges of long-dead trees scattered throughout the town. Arriving by caravan, Kamdida looked at her new home with despair. She was used to the forestland of the north, where her father's family had hailed from. Here there was no shade, little water, and a great open sky. The land looked dead.\n"
"\n"
"Her mother's family took Kamdida and her younger brother Nevith in, and they were very kind to the orphans, but she felt lonely in the alien village. It was not until she met an old Argonian woman who worked at the water factory that Kamdida found a friend. Her name was Sigerthe, and she said that her family had lived in Lorikh centuries before the Dwemer arrived, when it was a great and beauteous forest.\n"
"\n"
"\"Why did the trees die?\" asked Kamdida.\n"
"\n"
"\"When there were Argonians only in this land, we never cut trees, for we had no need for fuel or wooden structures such as you possess. When the Dwemer came, we allowed them to use the plants as they needed them, provided they never touched the Hist, which were sacred to us and to the land. For many years, we lived peaceably. No one wanted for anything.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"What happened?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Some of your scientists discovered that by distilling a certain tree sap, molding it, and drying it, they could create a resilient kind of armor called resin,\" said Sigerthe. \"Most of the trees that grew here had very thin ichor in their branches, but not the Hist. Many of them fairly glistened with sap, which made the Dwemer merchants greedy. They hired a woodsman named Juhnin to start clearing the sacred arbors for profit.\"\n"
"\n"
"The old Argonian woman looked to the dusty ground and sighed. \"Of course, the Argonians cried out against it. It was our home, and the Hist, once gone, would never return. The merchants reconsidered, but Juhnin took it on his own to break our spirit. He proved one terrible, bloody day that his prodigious skill with the axe could be used against people as well as trees. Any Argonian who stood in his way was hewn asunder. The Dwemer people of Lorikh closed their doors and their ears to the cries of murder.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Horrible,\" gasped Kamdida.\n"
"\n"
"\"It is difficult to explain,\" said Sigerthe, \"but the deaths of our living ones was not nearly as horrible to us as the death of our trees. You must understand that to my people, the Hist are where we come from and where we are going. Destroying our bodies is nothing. Destroying our trees annihilates us utterly. When Juhnin turned his axe on the Hist, he killed the land. The water disappeared, the animals died, and all the other life that the trees nourished crumbled and dried to dust.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Then why are you still here?\" asked Kamdida. \"Why didn't you leave?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"We are trapped. I am one of the last of a dying people. Few of us are strong enough to live away from our ancestral groves, and sometimes, even now, there is a perfume in the air of Lorikh that gives us life. It will not be long until we are all gone.\"\n"
"\n"
"Kamdida felt tears welling up in her eyes. \"Then I will be alone in this horrible place with no trees and no friends.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"We Argonians have an expression,\" said Sigerthe with a sad smile, taking Kamdida's hand. \"The best soil for a seed is found in your heart.\"\n"
"\n"
"Kamdida looked into the palm of her hand and saw that Sigerthe had given her a small black pellet. It was a seed. \"It looks dead.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"It can only grow in one place in all Lorikh,\" said the old Argonian. \"Outside an old cottage in the hills outside town. I cannot go there, for the owner would kill me on sight. Like all my people, I am too frail to defend myself now, but you can go there and plant the seed.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"What will happen?\" asked Kamdida. \"Will the Hist return?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"No, but some part of their power will.\"\n"
"\n"
"That night, Kamdida stole from her house and into the hills. She knew the cottage Sigerthe had mentioned. As she approached it, the door opened and an old but powerfully built man appeared with a mighty axe slung over his shoulder.\n"
"\n"
"\"What are you doing here, child?\" he demanded. \"In the dark, I almost took you to be a lizard-man.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I've lost my way in the dark. I'm trying to get back to Lorikh.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Be on your way then.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Do you have a candle I might have?\" she asked piteously. \"I've been walking in circles, and I'm afraid I'll only return back here without light.\"\n"
"\n"
"The old man grumbled and walked into his house. Quickly, Kamdida dug a hole in the dry dirt and buried the seed as deeply as she could. He returned with a lit candle.\n"
"\n"
"\"See to it you don't come back here,\" he growled, \"or I'll chop you in half.\"\n"
"\n"
"He returned to his house. The next morning, when he awoke and opened the door, he found that his cottage was entirely sealed within an enormous tree. He picked up his axe and delivered blow and after blow to the wood, but he could never break through. He tried side chops, but the wood healed itself. He tried an upper chop, but the wood sealed.\n"
"\n"
"Much time went by before someone discovered old Juhnin's emaciated body lying in front of his open door, still holding his blunted, broken axe. What he'd been chopping with it was a mystery, but the rumor spread that Hist sap was found on the blade.\n"
"\n"
"Shortly thereafter, small flowers began pushing up through the town's dry dirt. The Hist did not return, but at twilight the shadows of great trees would fill the streets."

"로리크는 아주 작은 마을로, 데쟈시트 의 회색과 갈색 모래언덕과 반들반들한 바위에 자리잡은 조용하고 평화로운 드웨머 공동체였다. 비록 새카맣게 타 죽은 긴 나무들의 흔적이 마을 내부에 걸쳐 흩어져 있기는 했지만, 로리크에는 어떤 종류의 식물도 자라지 않았다. 캐러밴을 타고 도착한 캄디다는 그녀의 새 집을 절망스럽게 바라보았다. 그녀는 그녀의 아버지의 가족이 살던 북부의 삼림지에 익숙해져 있었다. 여기에는 그늘이 없었고, 약간의 물과, 광활한 하늘이 있었다. 그것은 마치 죽은 땅 같았다.\n"
"\n"
"그녀 모친의 가족은 캄디다와 그녀의 남동생을 네비스로 데리고 갔으며 고아들에게 매우 친절했지만, 그녀는 생경한 마을에서 외로움을 느꼈다. 캄디다의 첫 친구는 물 공장에서 일하던 늙은 아고니언 여자였다. 그녀의 이름은 시거데 였다. 그녀의 가족들은 드웨머가 도착하기 100여년 전, 로리크가 거대하고 아름다운 숲이었을 적부터 거기에 살았다고 했다.\n"
"\n"
"\"왜 나무들이 죽었죠?\" 캄디다가 물었다.\n"
"\n"
"\"이 땅에 아고니언들만 있었을 때, 우리는 땔감을 만들거나 집을 지으려고 나무를 베지 않았지. 드웨머가 왔을 때, 우리는 그들이 성스러운 히스트 나무를 건드리지 않는다는 조건으로 그들이 필요한 나무를 쓰도록 했어. 오랜 기간 동안 우리는 평화롭게 지내왔다. 누구도 무엇을 원하지 않았어.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"무슨 일이 있었던거죠?\"\n"
"\n"
"너희의 학자들 중 몇몇이 특정한 나무 수액을 증류해 모양을 만들고 말리면 탄력이 있는 방어구인 레진 (resin)이라는 것을 만들 수 있다는 것을 발견했어.\" 시거데가 말했다.\n"
"\n"
"\"여기에서 자라는 대부분의 나무는 아주 얇은 영액만을 가지에 지니고 있었지만, 히스트 나무는 그렇지 않았지. 대부분이 영액으로 번들거렸고, 이게 드웨머 장사치들을 탐욕스럽게 만들었어. 그놈들은 돈을 벌기 위해서 쥬닌 (Juhnin)이라는 나무꾼을 고용해서는 그 성스러운 나무들을 베어내기 시작했어.\"\n"
"\n"
"이 늙은 아고니언 여자는 먼지덮힌 땅을 바라보고는 한숨지었다. \"당연히, 우리 아고니언들은 이에 대해 크게 항의했지. 여긴 우리의 집이었고, 히스트 나무는 한번 없어지면 다시 돌아오지 않는 것이었어. 상인들은 생각을 고쳐먹었지만 쥬닌은 우리 말을 듣지 않았고 결국 우리의 영혼을 부수어버렸다. 어느 피비린내 나는 끔찍한 날, 그 놈은 그 잘난 도끼 쓰는 기술이 사람들에게도 쓰일 수 있다는 걸 보여줬어. 그를 막던 그 모든 아고니언들이 토막나고 말았다. 심지어 아이들도 말야. 로리크의 드웨머 사람들은 문을 닫고 귀를 틀어막고는 그 살인에 대해 울부짖었어.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"끔찍하군요.\" 캄디다가 말했다.\n"
"\n"
"\"설명하기 힘들지만\" 시거데가 말을 이었다. \"우리 동족들의 죽음은 우리의 나무들의 죽음에 비하면 끔찍했다고만 할 수는 없지. 자네는 우리네들에게 히스트 나무는 우리가 나는 곳이자 우리가 가는 곳이란 것을 이해해야 하네. 우리의 육신을 파괴하는 것은 아무것도 아니라네. 우리의 나무를 파괴하는 것은 우리를 완전히 절멸시키는 것이지. 쥬닌이 히스트 나무를 향해 그의 도끼를 휘둘렀을 때, 그는 대지를 죽인 것이었어. 물이 사라지고, 동물들이 죽었으며, 그리고 히스트를 자양분으로 삼았던 다른 모든 생명들이 바스라졌고 말라 비틀어져서는 먼지처럼 되었다.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"하지만 당신은 아직 여기에 계시는군요?\" 캄디다가 물었다. \"왜 떠나지 않으시는거죠?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"우리는 갇혀있는 거야. 나는 죽어가는 마지막 사람들 중 하나이지. 우리들 중 몇몇은 우리의 조상들의 무덤에서 떨어져 있어도 살아있을 만큼 강했어. 그리고 때때로는, 심지어는 지금도, 우리에게 생명을 주는 로리크의 향기가 대기에 깃들어 있지. 우리가 모두 떠날 때가 얼마 남지 않았어.\"\n"
"\n"
"캄디다는 눈에서 차오르는 눈물을 느꼈다. \"그러면 나는 이 끔찍한 땅에서 나무도 친구도 없이 혼자 살아야겠군요.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"우리 아고니언들이 하는 말이 있다네\" 시거데가 슬픈 미소를 지으며, 캄디다의 손을 잡았다. \"씨앗을 위한 최고의 토양은 너의 마음 속에 있다.\"\n"
"\n"
"캄디다는 그녀의 손바닥을 바라보았고, 시거데가 그녀에게 준 작고 검은 알갱이를 보았다. 그것은 씨앗이었다. \"죽은 것 같아 보이는데요.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"로리크를 통틀어 한 장소에서만 자랄 수 있다네.\" 늙은 아고니언 여자가 말했다. \"마을 밖 언덕에 있는 낡은 오두막 밖 말이지. 나는 거기에 갈 수 없어. 오두막 주인이 나를 보자마자 죽이려 들 테니 말일세. 그리고 내 동족들과 마찬가지로 내 스스로를 지키기에도 너무 늙었어. 하지만 자네는 거기 가서 이 씨앗을 심을 수 있지.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"그럼 어떻게 되는거죠?\" 캄디다가 물었다. \"히스트 나무가 돌아올까요?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"아니. 하지만 그 나무가 가진 힘 일부는 돌아올 걸세.\"\n"
"\n"
"그날 밤, 캄디다는 그녀의 집에서 살며시 나와 언덕으로 향했다. 그녀는 시거데가 말하던 오두막을 알고 있었다. 그녀의 숙모와 삼촌은 절대로 거기에 가지 말라고 당부하고 했다. 그녀가 오두막에 가까워지자, 문이 열리고 나이는 들었지만 근육질투성이의 남자가 거대한 도끼를 어깨에 아무렇게나 걸치고 나타났다.\n"
"\n"
"\"여기서 무엇을 하는 거지, 꼬마야?\" 그가 따져 물었다. \"어두워서, 난 네가 도마맵 녀석인줄 알았지 뭐냐.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"어두워서 길을 잃었어요.\" 그녀가 재빨리 대답했다. \"로리크에 있는 제 집으로 돌아가려는 중이에요.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"그럼 갈 길을 가거라.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"혹시 양초를 하나 주실 수 없으신지요?\" 그녀가 가여운 목소리로 말했다.  \"지금까지 계속 길을 헤매고 있었는데, 불빛 없이는 다시 여기로 돌아올거 같아서요.\"\n"
"\n"
"늙은 남자는 툴툴거리며 집안으로 들어갔다. 재빠르게, 캄디다는 마른 땅에 구멍을 파고는 그녀가 할 수 있는 한 깊이 씨앗을 심었다. 그는 불 붙인 양초를 들고는 돌아왔다.\n"
"\n"
"\"이쪽으로 다시 돌아오지 않도록 해라.\" 그가 으르렁대며 말했다. \"다시 보이면 반으로 쪼개버리겠다.\"\n"
"\n"
"그는 그의 집으로 돌아갔다. 다음날 아침, 그는 일어나서 문을 열었고 그의 오두막이 거대한 나무로 완전히 둘러싸여 있는 것을 보았다. 그는 도끼를 집어들고 나무를 찍고 찍었지만 그는 나무를 뚫고 나가기에는 역부족이었다. 그는 옆으로 나무를 찍어보았지만 나무는 스스로 회복하였다. 그는 위로 나무를 찍은 다음 아래로 나무를 찍어 쐐기 모양을 만들어 보려고 했지만, 나무가 그것을 막았다.\n"
"\n"
"열린 문 앞에 누워있는 늙은 쥬닌의 수척해보이는 시체를 누군가가 발견한 것은 많은 시간이 지난 뒤였다. 그는 무뎌지고 부러져버린 그의 도끼를 손에 쥐고 있었다. 그가 무엇을 향해 도끼를 휘두르고 있었는지는 모두에게 의문으로 남았다. 하지만 로리크 마을을 통해 돌기 시작한 전설에 의하면 그의 도끼날에는 히스트 나무의 수액이 묻어 있었다고 한다.\n"
"\n"
"사건이 있고부터 얼마 지나지 않아, 작은 사막꽃이 마을의 메마른 땅에서 여기저기 피어나기 시작했다. 새로 심어진 나무와 초목들은 무성할 정도는 아니지만 어느정도는 자생하기 시작했다. 히스트 나무는 돌아오지 않았다. 하지만 캄디다와 로리크 마을 사람들은 거대한 옛 나무들의 길고 너른 그림자가 황혼무렵 어느 때 거리와 언덕들을 채우게 될 것이라는 것을 인식했다."

"The Ransom of Zarek, Part 1\n"
"\n"
"By Marobar Sul\n"
"\n"
"Jalemmil stood in her garden and read the letter her servant had brought her. The bouquet of roses in her hand fell to the ground. For a moment, it was as if all birds had ceased to sing and a cloud had passed over the sky. Her carefully cultivated haven seemed to flood over with darkness.\n"
"\n"
"\"We have thy son,\" it read. \"We will be in touch with thee shortly with our ransom demands.\"\n"
"\n"
"Zarek had never made it as far as Akgun after all. One of the brigands on the road, Orcs probably, or accursed Dunmer, must have seen his well-appointed carriage and taken him hostage. Jalemmil clutched at a post for support, wondering if her boy had been hurt. He was but a student, not the sort to fight against well-armed men, but had they beaten him? It was more than a mother's heart could bear.\n"
"\n"
"\"Don't tell me they sent the ransom note so quickly,\" called a familiar voice, and a familiar face appeared through the hedge. It was Zarek. Jalemmil hurried to embrace her boy, tears running down her face.\n"
"\n"
"\"What happened?\" she cried. \"I thought thou hadst been kidnapped.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I was,\" said Zarek. \"Three huge soaring Nords attacked my carriage on the Frimvorn Pass. Brothers, as I learned, named Mathais, Ulin, and Koorg. Thou shouldst have seen these men, mother. Each one of them would have had trouble fitting through the front door, I can tell thee.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"What happened?\" Jalemmil repeated. \"Wert thou rescued?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I thought about waiting for that, but I knew they'd send off a ransom note and I know how thou dost worry. So I remembered what my mentor at Akgun always said about remaining calm, observing thy surroundings, and looking for thy opponent's weakness.\" Zarek grinned. \"It took a while, though, because these fellows were truly monsters. And then, when I listened to them bragging to one another, I realized that vanity was their weakness.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"What didst thou do?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"They had me chained at their camp in the woods not far from Cael on a high knoll overlooking a wide river. I heard one of them, Koorg, telling the others that it would take the better part of an hour to swim across the river and back. They were nodding in agreement when I spoke up.\n"
"\n"
"\"'I could swim that river and back in thirty minutes,' I said.\n"
"\n"
"\"'Impossible,' said Koorg. 'I can swim faster than a little whelp like thee.'\n"
"\n"
"\"So it was agreed that we would dive off the cliff, swim to the center island, and return. As we went to our respective rocks, Koorg took it upon himself to lecture me about all the fine points of swimming: the importance of synchronized movements of the arms and legs for maximum speed, and how essential it was to breathe after only the third or fourth stroke, not too often to slow thyself down, but not too little to lose one's air. I nodded and agreed to all his fine points. Then we dove off the cliffs. I made it to the island and back in a little over an hour, but Koorg never returned. He had dashed his brains at the rocks at the base of the cliff. I had noticed the telltale signs of underwater rocks and had taken the diving rock on the right.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"But thou returned?\" asked Jalemmil, astounded. \"Was that not when thou escaped?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"It was too risky to escape then,\" said Zarek. \"They could have easily caught me again, and I wasn't keen to be blamed for Koorg's disappearance. I said I did not know what happened to him, and after some searching, they decided he had forgotten about the race and had swum ashore to hunt for food. They could not see how I could have had anything to do with his disappearance, as fully visible as I was throughout my swim. The two brothers began making camp along the rocky cliff-edge, picking an ideal location so that I would not be able to escape.\n"
"\n"
"\"One of the brothers, Mathais, began commenting on the quality of the soil and the gradual incline of the rock that circled around the bay below. It was ideal, he said, for a foot race. I expressed my ignorance of the sport, and he was keen to give me details of the proper technique for running a race. He made absurd faces, showing how one must breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth; how to bend one's knees to the proper angle on the rise, and the importance of sure foot placement. Most important, he explained, was that one must keep an aggressive but not too strenuous pace if one intends to win. It is fine to run in second place through the race, he said, provided one has the willpower and strength to pull out in the end.\n"
"\n"
"\"I was an enthusiastic student, and Mathais decided that we ought to run a quick race around the edge of the bay before night fell. Ulin told us to bring some firewood when we came back. We began at once down the path, skirting the cliff below. I followed his advice about breath, gait, and foot placement, but I ran with all my power right from the start. Despite his much longer legs, I was a few paces ahead as we rounded the first corner.\n"
"\n"
"\"With his eyes on my back, Mathais did not see the gap in the rock that I jumped over. He plummeted over the cliff before he had a chance to cry out. I spent a few minutes gathering some twigs before I returned to Ulin at camp.\""

"자렉은 결국 아쿤 (Akgun)에 도착하지 못했어. 노상 강도 패거리들 중 하나거나, 아마 오크겠지. 아니면 저주받은 던머일 거야. 분명 화려한 마차를 보고 인질로 데려간거라구. 야레밀은 쓰러질 뻔한 것을 기둥에 기대어 버티면서, 아들에게 상처가 생기진 않았을까를 염려했다. 그는 평범한 학생으로, 무장된 사내들과 싸울 수 있는 아이는 아닌데, 그들이 아들을 때리지 않았을까?... 어머니의 마음으로는, 상상하기 괴로운 것이었다.\n"
"\n"
"\"벌써 몸값을 요구하는 편지가 왔다고 말하지는 마세요.\" 귀에 익은 목소리와 익숙한 얼굴이 울타리의 틈새로부터 보였다. 자렉이었다. 야레밀은 눈물을 흘리면서, 소년을 꼭 껴안으러 달려갔다.\n"
"\n"
"\"무슨 일이 있었던 거니?\" 그녀는 울면서 말했다. \"네가 납치당했다고 생각했는데.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"그랬어요.\" 자렉이 말했다. \"Frimvorn Pass에서 덩치가 엄청 큰 노드 3명이 마차를 덮쳤어요. 마티아스, 울린, 코그, 이 세명이 형제라는 것도 알았고. 엄마한테도 보여주고 싶었는데... 근데 생각해보니 현관으로 들어오기는 힘들 것 같네요.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"무슨 일이 있었던 거니?\" 라고 야레밀은 재차 물었다. \"구출된 거야?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"구출을 기다리려고 생각도 했는데, 몸값을 요구하는 편지를 쓴다는 걸 알았어요. 엄마는 걱정이 너무 많은 성격이니까. 아쿤의 스승님께서 자주 말했던 것을 기억해 냈던 거예요. 침착하게, 주위를 잘 보고, 적의 약점을 찾는다.\" 자렉은 싱긋 미소를 지었다. \"그 아저씨들 진짜 괴물같아서 시간은 좀 걸렸지만서도. 어쨌든, 아저씨들이 서로 자랑하는 얘기하는 걸 들었을 때, 자만심이 약점이란 걸 알았어요.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"그래서 어떻게 했어?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"카엘 (Cael) 가까이에 넓은 강이 내려다 보이는 작은 언덕의 숲에 캠프가 있었는데, 나는 거기에 쇠사슬로 묶여 있었어요. 그들 중 하나인 코그가 말하는 것을 엿들었는데, 그 강을 헤엄쳐 왕복하려면 1시간은 족히 걸릴거라고 했죠. 다른 두 명 역시 동의하듯 고개를 끄덕였고. 그 때, 내가 말을 걸었죠.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"나는 30분이면 돌아올 수 있는데.\" 그렇게 나는 얘기했어요.\n"
"\n"
"\"무리야.\" 라고 코그가 단언했죠. \"너 같은 꼬마보다는 내가 더 빨리 헤엄칠 수 있다.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"거기서, 같이 벼랑에서 뛰어 내려서, 한가운데의 섬까지 헤엄쳤다가 돌아오자고 정했어요. 약속된 바위까지 갔을 때, 코그가 의무인 것 마냥 수영의 요령을 나에게 강의하기 시작했죠. 최대의 속도를 내기 위해서는, 이어지는 팔과 다리의 움직임의 중요성. 호흡은, 너무 자주도 아니고 너무 늦어서도 안되게, 너무 적어서 숨이 차지는 않게, 반드시 3, 4회 저은 뒤에 하는 것이 중요하다는 둥. 그가 말하는 요령에 감탄하고 고개를 끄덕였어요. 그리고 나서, 각자 벼랑에서 뛰어 내렸어요. 난 1시간 조금 넘게 걸려 섬까지 헤엄쳤다 돌아왔지만, 코그는 돌아오지 않았어요. 왜냐면 그 아저씨는 벼랑 아래에 있는 물 속 바위에 정통으로 머리를 부딪혔으니까. 물의 움직임으로 수면 아래 바위의 위치를 알 수 있었기 때문에, 나는 오른 쪽 바위를 선택했던 거죠.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"그런데 그대로 돌아간 거야?\" 라고 놀란 야레밀은 물었다. \"그 때 도망치지 않았던 거니?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"그 때 도망치는 것은 너무 위험했어요.\" 라고, 자렉이 말했다.\"그 아저씨들은 어렵지 않게 날 다시 포박했고, 코그의 실종에 관한 이유도 묻지 않았어요. 난 코그가 어떻게 된건지 잘 모르겠다고 했고, 잠깐 찾는가 싶더니, 그 아저씨들은 코그가 수영시합을 잊고, 건너편 물가에서 식량이라도 구하는 중일거라고 애기했어요. 아저씨들이 내가 헤엄치고 있던 것은 봤으니까, 코그의 실종에 관계가 있다고는 생각하지 않았겠죠. 나머지 두 형제는 내가 도망가지 않을 이상적인 장소를 택해 바위가 많은 벼랑 끝에 캠프를 만들었죠.\"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\"그들 형제 중 한 명인 마티아스가 아래에 있는 강의 주위를 돌아 다니는 흙의 질과 바위의 완만한 경사에 대해 얘기하기 시작했어요. 달리기 시합에 이상적이야, 라고 그 아저씨는 얘기했어요. 내가 그 경기에 대해 아무것도 모른다고 말하면, 그 아저씨는 경쟁에 적절한 기술 하나하나를 알려주고 싶어했고요. 우스꽝스런 얼굴을 하고선, 얼마만큼 코로 숨을 들이마시고 입으로 내쉬어야 하나, 무릎을 적절한 각도는 어디까지인가, 다리 움직임의 중요성등. 제일 중요한 것은, 이길 생각이라면 주자는 적극적인, 그렇다고 해서 지나치게 속도를 내진 말라고 했죠. 마지막에 앞지른다는 의지와 체력이 있다면 다른 주자가 달리게 놔둬도 된다고 말했어요.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"나는 열정적인 학생처럼 듣고 있었어요. 그리고 마티아스는 밤이 되기 전에 강 가장자리 근처에서 간단한 빨리달리기 시합을 해야한다고 결정했고. 울린은 우리한테, 돌아올 적에 땔감이나 가져오라고 말했어요. 우리는 좁은 길을 지나자 마자, 벼랑을 따라서 달리기 시작했어요. 숨이나 발걸음이나 다리 움직임은 마티아스가 알려준대로 했지만, 처음부터 전속력으로 달렸어요. 그의 다리길이가 훨씬 길었지만, 처음의 모퉁이를 돌았을 때, 나는 그 아저씨보다 몇 걸음 더 앞서고 있었죠.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"그의 눈은 나의 등만을 보고 있었고, 마티아스는 내가 뛰어넘은 벼랑의 균열이 안 보였나봐요. 비명을 지를 새도 없이 아래로 떨어졌어요. 캠프에 있는 울린한테 돌아가기 전에, 나뭇가지 몇 개 들고갔죠.\""

"Witches and witch-hunters are, by nature, uncivil to one another, but the witches of Eastmarch and my clan, the Direfrost witch-hunters, have particularly bad blood between us. I cannot say I blame the witches for their hatred—we have clashed often in these mountainous regions, and we Direfrosts have become very good at slaying them. Eastmarch was once infested with the heathens, the landscape dotted with their covens. Everywhere one turned, one found sordid hovels built in honor of some Daedric Prince. Thanks to the efforts of my family over several generations, that number has dwindled to a scant few. They're there, to be sure—the schemes of Oblivion are myriad—but the witches move in fear, ducking between the narrowing shadows cast by the Flame of Direfrost.\n"

"By Hilaire Beanique\n"
"\n"
"The city of Wayrest owes much to its merchants for its ever-flourishing economy. The abundance of money has done the city wonders, earning Wayrest the moniker \"Jewel of the Bay\": the wealth of its citizens have paid for the shimmering stone used in the city's construction, the bright armor worn by the local law enforcement agents, and most significantly, the modern marvel of western Tamriel—the Wayrest Sewers.\n"
"\n"
"Written accounts dating back to the city's foundation hint that, until the Wayrest Sewers were finished, the city was a jewel mired in muck and mud. Vile, foul-smelling mud. Writes Silvia Cato, an Imperial sailor in 1E 801, \"The Bjoulsae River is a watercourse of refuse, of pungent tang, of disease, and the Iliac Bay is equally revolting where the Bjoulsae feeds into it. It's that damned Breton city.\"\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Bjoulsae River shines as brilliantly as Wayrest itself, thanks entirely to the sewers, which are a feat of engineering rivaling anything created by the Dwemer of old. The artisans ensured that the sewers' modular design permit travel across the city below ground as easily as above, as well as allow construction to continue to this day. The sewers, like the city itself, are regularly expanded. However, in its size lies the one drawback of the entire system: the sewers have become so large that Wayrest law enforcement has difficulty patrolling it all, and thus, crime finds its way even to the Jewel of the Bay. Like the city itself, most of these illicit activities can only be afforded by the rich, including skooma trade and necromancy (skooma is a narcotic that's widely banned across Tamriel, and necromancy, the magical art of raising the dead, is also forbidden in many regions).\n"
"\n"
"See Volume II for a list of noble families that donated most heavily to the sewer construction. The original designers who imagined the sewers just prior to the fall of Orsinium remain lost to time, though Volume III contains a list of artisans and engineers who have worked to expand development since the end of the First Era."

"\n"
"Conjuration even allows access to Daedric abilities (for those who dare to wield them). A mage well-versed in Conjuration can summon all variety of Daedra, from Scamps to Dremora Lords. Mine wouldn't be the first primer for spells like these, but Volume III of this collection contains detailed instructions on beckoning the denizens of Oblivion. \"The Origins of Conjuration\" is also a useful read on the subject.*\n"

"The Keeper's Primer Volume II: The Binding Stone\n"
"\n"
"From the Office of the Canonreeve of Corrections\n"
"\n"
"Altmeri texts reference many variations of the entrapment spell. Some of those spells, like the early First Era \"Aninaire's Tower,\" create physical fields around their targets. These varieties are unbreachable unless broken by an appropriate amount of force—like conjured stone walls, or shield wards turned inward. The effect differs in strength from spell to spell, but is generally effective for containing the layman prisoner, and certainly tougher to break free from than brick and mortar.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, sometimes a mage seeks to confine creatures that walls won't hold, magical or otherwise. Gaseous forms of the Wild Hunt, Nether Liches, and various ghosts and phantoms all have means to escape physical barriers. These must be imprisoned using spells that create completely impermeable surfaces while absorbing or stemming the magicka of their captives. These spells must be re-incanted constantly to avoid consuming themselves, usually at a high cost of magicka for the caster.\n"
"\n"
"The Binding Stone, which your Head Keeper will soon introduce to you if he hasn't already, functions as a combination of these spells. It's tangible, small, and therefore portable, but capable of holding all manner of magicka-wielding creatures—even ones as powerful as your charge.\n"
"I'm sure you understand the grave nature of what the prisoner's escape would mean, both to you, personally, and to Auridon and Tamriel as a whole. The condition of the Binding Stone is more important than the condition of your prisoner. Indeed, your very lives depend on the upkeep and maintenance of the Stone.\n"
"\n"
"And as for your prisoner: do not look at him. Do not speak to him. There is no specific danger in doing so, but any such interaction is a fruitless venture. Watch yourself, watch each other, do your duty, and your name will live forever among those who have committed everything to shield Auridon from his menace."

"An Introduction\n"

"By Belami Llevarso\n"
"\n"
"Kwama eggs have always been a Dunmeri delicacy, though I've heard they've found their way into Imperial kitchens, too. (Who knows what grisly dishes that lot would make with Kwama eggs? Would they stuff chickens with them? Poach them and put them in a bap? They are a disdainful people, and they make disdainful food.)\n"
"\n"
"To cook a kwama egg with any measure of success is to master the sharp, sour flavor, and the gummy texture. Kwama eggs are similar to scrib jelly in this way, and many a young chef (even Dunmeri chefs whose elders should have better taught them) has attempted to mask the eggs behind other ingredients, to camouflage the perceived unpleasantness. This is an abominable practice. A chef should never apologize for a kwama egg in her dishes by sweetening or embittering them. If the dish is properly prepared, supporting the kwama eggs' natural qualities, a cultured diner will embrace the meal in all its pungent glory. \n"
"\n"
"But what does that preparation entail? Only a Dunmer could tell you. Because only the Dunmer have the lifetimes of experience necessary to call ourselves culinary masters of the kwama egg. It was we who first tamed the kwama, after all.\n"
"\n"
"I, in turn, have spent a large portion of my years (of which there are many) immersing myself in the art. I have served kwama eggs to peasants and paupers, grandmasters and grandmistresses, and delighted them all.  And you, dear reader, will find within these volumes the combined knowledge of my entire career. It takes a lifetime of cooking kwama eggs to truly understand the subtle, but brilliant differences between the various methods of preparation, and I have catalogued them all here—all the ones of worth, at least. Follow these recipes exactly. Just as a mage should hesitate to improvise in her spell-casting, lest she find a Daedra in her drawing room, the kwama egg chef should not stray from the paths I've laid out here—painstakingly crafted from years of trial and error.\n"
"\n"
"Believe me—if it works, I've found it. \n"
"\n"

"Civility and Etiquette Volume III: Wood Orcs, Part I\n"
"\n"
"Elden Hollow\n"
"\n"
"By Coristir, Sage Sojourner\n"
"\n"
"It is said that the Orcs came to be when the Aldmeri god, Trinimac, was devoured by the Daedric Prince Boethiah. As the myth goes, Boethiah excreted Trinimac's remains, and those Aldmer who followed Trinimac rubbed that excrement on themselves to become Orcs. Perhaps it's just a myth, but the imagery is appropriate: repugnant, ridiculous, and a little comical, like the Orcs themselves. It's said that, after a time, a sect of these people traveled into Valenwood and developed a tangential culture: the Wood Orcs. (For dealings with Orsinium Orcs, see Volume II.)\n"
"\n"
"The Orcs in general are difficult for Mer to interact with, but these Wood Orcs are similar in physicality to our Wood Elf cousins, the Bosmer. The Wood Orcs are blunter and more ill-tempered than the Bosmer, but should be handled in much the same way: with patience, guidance, and a careful eye. Without a proper Altmeri hand to lead them, both races have the potential to devolve into self-destructive, orderless savages that are an inconvenience and danger to all civilized people around them. \n"
"\n"
"So how should an Altmer deal with a Wood Orc?\n"
"\n"
"First, earn her respect. Like her northern, Orsinium cousins (the more common Orc variety), a Wood Orc admires physical strength, but she also prizes agility, speed, and geographical knowledge (equating that with tactical knowledge). Display some semblance of competence in these areas and you will earn her begrudging appreciation.\n"
"\n"
"Here are a few ways to begin a conversation (as a sign of respect, make sure to introduce yourself or at least establish eye contact first):\n"
"\n"
"1.\tOffer to begin an unarmed altercation and force the Wood Orc to submit. They enjoy fisticuffs.\n"
"\n"
"2.\tIf you find yourself walking with a Wood Orc, gain the lead and maintain it. This may lead to a footrace. Win it, and win the Wood Orc's approval.\n"
"\n"
"3.\tFind a large rock—equal to or greater than body size—and hurl it, within view. Use a strength spell if you must, but don't let the Wood Orc know.\n"
"\n"
"If you think this sounds like impressing your way into a tribe of athletic children, you would not be far wrong. Use the above methods with caution—predictable as they may be, Wood Orcs are individuals, and require improvisation in dealing with them.\n"
"\n"
"And here are a few things an Altmer should not do when interacting with Wood Orcs:\n"
"\n"
"1.\tFlaunt magical abilities. Though the Altmer know that displaying advanced magic shows a lifetime of dedication and mastery of the highest craft, all Orcs bear a cultural distrust of magic. In their ignorance, they believe magic's primary function is oppression of their people, and often bridle at its use.\n"
"\n"
"2.\tUnless you're intending to ignite a battle, never hide in the trees of Wood Orc territory. Walk in the open. As our Bosmer cousins have learned, the Wood Orcs do not take kindly to those who stalk their forests. They equate secret movement with malevolence and cowardice.\n"
"\n"
"In Part II of this collection, I'll detail specific hurdles that may come up in conversation with a Wood Orc, such as religion and Malacath, and the Wood Orc equivalent of Orsinium strongholds."

"Bring this to Neidir's attention immediately. It's a transcript of an old text, but she needs to see this. Beg her pardon for the conjecture on Nord legends and Psijic nonsense, but this text contains the angle of attack she was looking for:\n"
"\n"
"Weather magic has never been an exact science, perhaps because of the temperamental nature of what it seeks to control.\n"
"\n"
"Minor spells to conjure gusts of wind or forks of lightning are common, but manipulation of a region's climate is much more difficult to achieve. Our war wizards have longed for the ability to lower catastrophic hailstorms onto enemy borders as a preamble to invasion, or to halt a blizzard to make an unexpected march through inclement weather.\n"
"\n"
"There are claims to such spells—spells originating from foreign lands and beyond.\n"
"\n"
"Legend has it that a sect of Nords in faraway Skyrim command the spell-like language of dragons, which allowed them some mastery over the weather. Accounts of these Nords' abilities during the Merethic Era Dragon War include the power to diminish fogs, mists, and clouds with the sheer bravado of their shouts. Negil's \"Dragons at Windhelm\" notes that an army of these bellowing Nords foiled an airborne sneak attack by dragons who sought to strike under a cover of storm clouds. Negil writes, \"We thought the heavy clouds looked better parted, and when we spoke our Words of Power, the clouds thought so, too. But even with their passing, the sun remained hidden.

"Far to the southwest of Skyrim, members of the Psijic Order have been long-rumored to possess spells cast in the Old Way of magic that can bend the elements to the user's desire. Our scouts have reported sudden lightning and flash rain turning to small-scale blizzards off the coast of Artaeum for years. It's possible instructional texts on the matter exist—and translating them from the Old Way into intelligible magic will be difficult, but it would be an excellent starting point.\n"
"\n"
"Arresea's \"The Daedric Primer\" describes a spell devised by Sheogorath, Daedric Prince, called Manipulate Weather. She writes, \"Sheogorath's spell folio includes an incantation to match the weather with his mood. The Lord of the Madhouse has been known to teach the spell to mortals in his favor, allowing them to alter the climate of an entire region. Unfortunately, the spell functions at Sheogorath's whim, no matter who casts it—meaning it functions entirely randomly. There are stories of his followers trying to stymie flashfloods but summoning torrential rain instead, or trying to put out brush fires and feeding the flames with unwanted lightning storms, to Sheogorath's delight. Making a Daedric Pact with Sheogorath is probably not in our best interest, but it seems there is something we can learn from the Prince of Madness.\n"
"\n"
"I include the above examples to say that large-scale weather control has been noted across the world, to convince King Orgnum or any in his close circle that weaponizing such an ability would be an incredible asset to the Maormer military. \n"
"\n"
"I set out to prove as much this past winter, with the help of twenty journeyman mages. We didn't quite succeed—though we're on the cusp of success. We started by clearing an open plain near the sea and created a lightning storm by manipulating the charge of a passing cloud with our own skeins of lightning. It worked, but we lost a member of our group (entirely regrettable) to the sudden storm and a fork of wayward lightning. It's possible we would all have perished had our storm not consumed itself. We tried several times, managing to lengthen the duration of the storm each time, even learned to direct it out over the water. But the duration of our spell remained our enemy, and we eventually had to admit that the exercise would be futile in a battle. \n"
"\n"
"We concluded that if we had had some way to physically suspend our spell at a high altitude—perhaps with a conduit device? Perhaps a series of devices—we would eliminate the need for continued expenditure of magicka and free the casters to direct a storm across a great distance."

"\n"
"이상의 예시를 들어 이와 같이 말할 수 있다. 대규모의 날씨 조작은 세계 전역에 기록되어 있고, 오그넘 왕이나 그의 측근들이 이러한 능력을 무기로 사용한다면 마오머 군의 엄청난 자산이 될 것이다.\n"

"\n"
"우리는 마법을 높은 위치에서 물리적으로 지속시키는 어떠한 수단이 있어야 한다는 결론을 내렸다. 도관 같은 것일까? 아마도 그러한 장치가 있다면 매지카를 계속해서 소모할 필요 없이 주문 시전자가 장거리를 넘어 폭풍을 자유롭게 조작할 수 있을 것이다."

It was once the Anticipation's Finger, and only found its way to Tamriel because it was stolen from the eighth arm of the Webspinner herself. With the Ring of Khajiit, Rajhin grasped the spark of godhood. It wrapped him in shadow so dark that none could reach him. Not the Anticipation of Vivec; not even the passage of time.\n"

Rajhin is not cruel, or malicious—sometimes, when the Moons fit his mood, he gives them back.\n"
"\n"
"From the Webspinner's threads, Rajhin found his way to a land where all trees have fallen, and the only currency is knowledge. There, Rajhin pillaged the Book that Knows from the one who knows it all and disappeared amongst sheaves in the wind. The lord of that land has never stopped seeking his treasured volume, and, sometimes, when the Moons are right—he finds it. Because, sometimes, Rajhin gives it back.\n"

"Volendrung is one of the most notorious mythological artifacts in history. It has cultural ties to the Dwemer as well as the Daedra, though scholars fail to agree on just about every detail that has ever been written about it—including whether or not different accounts are referencing the same object.\n"
"\n"
"Academics recognize one such artifact, called Volendrung, as a Dwemer relic forged by Clan Rourken. It was carried into battle as a family symbol as much as it was the chieftain's weapon, and was made famous when the Rourkens refused to join the First Council of Chimer and Dwemer. The other Dwemer forsook them for the slight, and the Rourkens refused to stay with their people if it meant an alliance with the Chimer—their sworn enemies.\n"
"\n"
"So the Rourken chieftain hurled Volendrung into the sky, declaring that their people would find a home wherever it landed. Volendrung thus served as a guiding light for Clan Rourken in exile as the Hammer roared, beastlike, across the sky. It shone like a second sun during the day, mirrored the moons at night, and led the Rourken to the other side of the continent. There, they supposedly founded the fabled city of Volenfell—which has yet to be discovered in the modern era, if it ever truly existed.\n"
"\n"
"But how did the unidentified Rourken chieftain manage such a tremendous throw? Dwemer armies were known for their engines of war, and their mechanical infantry. If the Dwemer had the capability to project a weapon cross-continent by hand, why did they never utilize such long-range assaults in warfare? Even a modern Arch-Mage would have difficulty concocting a spell to launch an object over such a distance. Unless Volendrung was actually a flying engine, powered by lost Dwemer mechanics, the whole story reeks of a Bosmer tale.\n"
"\n"
"Some skeptics, including this one, believe the Dwemer Volendrung's flight is simply poetic imagery representing the wandering exile of Clan Rourken.\n"
"\n"
"A second hammer called Volendrung, this time a Daedric artifact belonging to the Daedric Prince Malacath, exists in records nearly as old as the Dwemer version. Malacath's relic echoes the Dwemer name, and for this reason, many assume that it is the same legendary weapon. But why would the God of Curses associate himself with an object forged by enemies? To make a mockery of Dwemer work? To take something the Dwemer treasured and use it as an instrument against them? A rather subversive and indirect action—unbecoming of Malacath's historically straightforward mentality.\n"
"\n"
"Angarin's \"The Daedric Armory\" speculates on the Hammer's magical features: the text cites several Mages Guild papers, claiming the Hammer empowers its wielder, and drains the strength of struck foes—very much in line with a Malacathan design. There is little doubt that the relic described could be tied to the God of Curses. What is in doubt is whether it was named by mortals or by Malacath himself—and whether the Rourken Clan wielded the same Hammer in centuries past.\n"

"\n"
"학자들은 볼렌드렁이라 불리는 가공물을 로어켄 부족이 만든 드웨머 유물로 인정하고 있다. 이것은 가문의 상징이자 족장의 무기로써 전투에 투입되었고, 로어켄 부족이 치머와 드웨머 간의 첫 의회에 가입하는 것을 거부한 것을 계기로 유명해졌다. 다른 드웨머는 그들을 사소하게 여겼고, 로어켄은 철천지 원수인 치머와 동맹을 맺는다면 그들을 떠나기로 결심했다.\n"
"\n"
"그리하여 로어켄 족장은 볼렌드렁을 하늘로 던지며 그것이 떨어진 곳을 고향으로 삼겠다고 다짐했다. 이렇게 하여 볼렌드렁은 추방된 로어켄 부족을 인도하는 빛으로써의 역할을 맡게 되었다. 던져진 망치는 짐승 같은 포효를 내며 하늘을 가로질렀다. 낮에는 두 번째 태양처럼 빛나고, 밤에는 달빛을 비추며 로어켄 부족을 대륙 반대편으로 이끌었다. 그렇게 하여 그들은 전설의 도시 볼렌펠을 발견했다고 한다. 그 도시는 실존한다고 하더라도 현재로써는 발견되지 않았다.\n"
"\n"
"하지만 정체불명의 로어켄 족장은 어떻게 그렇게 강하게 볼렌드렁을 던질 수 있었을까? 드웨머 군은 전쟁 수행 능력과 기계 보병대로 유명하다. 드웨머가 무기를 한 손으로 대륙을 넘을 정도로 던질 수 있는 능력이 있었다면, 왜 그 능력을 활용해서 장거리 전투를 벌이지 않은 걸까? 현대의 대마법사라고 해도 물체를 그렇게 멀리까지 날아가게 하는 마법을 만드는 것은 쉽지 않다. 볼렌드렁이 사실 사장된 드웨머의 비행 장치를 이용해서 날아가게 한 것이 아니라면 이 전말은 보스머의 이야기처럼 느껴진다.\n"
"\n"
"몇몇 회의론자는 이 가설조차 부정하며, 단순히 로어켄 부족이 여기저기 방황한 것을 시적 상상력으로 표현한 것이라고 주장하기도 한다.\n"
"\n"
"볼렌드렁이라 불리는 두 번째 망치는 데이드릭 프린스인 말라카스의 데이드릭 아티팩트로, 기록에 따르면 드웨머가 가진 것과 비슷하게 오래 전부터 존재해 왔다고 한다. 말라카스의 유물은 드웨머의 망치와 같은 이름이기 때문에 많은 사람들이 동일한 전설의 무기라고 생각한다. 하지만 왜 저주의 신이 자신의 적과 연관된 물건을 만들었을까? 드웨머의 작품의 모조품을 만드려고? 드웨머의 보물을 빼앗아서 그들에 대항하는 도구로 쓰려고? 오히려 파괴적이고 간접적인 마라카스의 역사적으로 단순한 사고 방식에 어울리지 않는 행동이다.\n"
"\n"
"안가린의 \"데이드라의 무기\"에서는 이 망치의 마법적 성질에 대해서 추측하고 있다. 여기서는 몇몇 마법사 길드의 논문을 인용한 후, 이 망치를 휘두른 자에게 힘을 줘서 공격받은 자의 힘을 빼앗아 간다고 주장하고 있다. 말라카스의 의도와 잘 어울리는 성질이다. 아직 작은 의문이 남아 있다. 유물을 명명한 것이 필멸자인지 말라카스 자신인지, 또한 로어켄 부족이 수 세기 후에도 동일한 망치를 사용했는지 여부이다.\n"

"The following is an intercepted Morag Tong memorandum in full, noted here for conjecture on the Daedric artifact Ebony Blade:\n"
"\n"
"Before I begin, let me preface by stating: the Daedric Prince Mephala and her worshippers value arcanum above all else—you will learn this, in time. To Hermaeus Mora, knowledge is power, but Mephala concerns herself with only the choicest morsels: knowledge secluded, undisclosed.\n"
"\n"
"The various Daedric artifacts associated with Mephala share this disposition, chief among them, the Ebony Blade, of which little is known. The records of the Tong themselves disagree on the properties locked within the Blade's metal. But I'll share what I know about it, and in return, you will complete your first assignment for the guild. I hope you'll find the Flowers of Gold a suitable base of operations. Your room is a favorite of mine. Warm and dry.\n"
"\n"
"First: the Blade initially passed into the Morag Tong's notice (this decade, at least) when our brother Orndras obtained it, taking it from Rivis, another brother. Rivis had the Blade kept in a safehouse for years, hidden from his fellow Morag Tong. How did Orndras find Rivis out? He'll take that secret to his grave, but his handlers whispered that the Web Spinner herself had told him. Even the Tong is unsure how the Blade is connected to Mephala, whether it is an extension of her physical form, or if her essence is bound to it, but it's important to her. And that makes it important to us.\n"
"\n"
"Second: Rivis was an ambitious mage, one of the Tong's most powerful. And he was not about to allow Orndras to leave his safehouse with the Ebony Blade in tow. There was a duel between them, and when Orndras drew first blood with the Blade—and failed to kill—he was surprised Rivis did not engulf him in a fiery spell. It's possible the Blade can silence a mage, stymie the flow of magicka, or simply absorb it.\n"
"\n"
"Third: Rivis was keen with an edge, and better skilled than Orndras. But Orndras wielded the Ebony Blade, and the wounds he suffered stitched themselves together as the battle continued—as Orndras dealt his less-precise cuts. Perhaps a restorative property of the Blade.\n"
"\n"
"Fourth: Rivis' last words were, \"The Vampire will be the end of us all.\" Orndras believed he was referring to the Blade, that Rivis had hidden it out of legitimate fear. I believe that even the most venerable of the Morag Tong will say anything when backed into a corner. I have.\n"
"\n"
"Fifth: Orndras retrieved the Blade, made a detailed report to his handlers—and then attempted to slaughter them. He murdered all but one. His actions had no discernible rhyme or reason or motive, and he was last seen on the third floor of the Flowers of Gold.\n"
"\n"
"Return the Ebony Blade to us, whether Orndras comes with it or not. Look for a Dunmer with a scar under his left eye."

"다음은 중간에 빼돌린 모락 통에 대한 견해서로, 데이드릭 아티팩트인 에보니 블레이드에 대한 추측을 기록하고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"시작하기 전에 다음과 같이 서문을 쓰겠다. 데이드릭 프린스 메팔라와 그 숭배자는 신비에 가치를 두고 있다. 이 일은 시간이 지나면 알게 될 것이다. 헤르메우스 모라에게 있어 지식은 힘이지만 메팔라는 남들에게 거의 알려지지 않은 은밀한 지식만을 추구한다.\n"
"\n"
"메팔라와 관련된 데이드릭 아티팩트에도 이러한 경향이 있다. 그 중 가장 유명한 것은 바로 거의 알려지지 않은 에보니 블레이드다. 금속 안에 깃든 성질에 대해서는 모락 통에 대한 기록 내에서조차 의견이 엇갈리고 있다. 하지만 내가 아는 것을 공유하고자 한다. 그 대신 길드의 첫 번째 임무를 완수하기를 바란다. 황금꽃에 걸맞는 작전 기지를 찾아 주기를 바란다. 네 방은 정말 마음에 든다. 따뜻하고 건조하다.\n"
"\n"
"첫 번째: 처음에는 모락 통이 (적어도 10년간은) 그 검에 주목했다. 우리 동료 오른드라스가 다른 동료 리비스한테서 그 검을 빼앗았을 때였다. 리비스는 모락 통의 다른 동료에게 비밀로 하고 검을 몇 년간 은신처에 보관하고 있었다. 오른드라스는 어떻게 그 검을 찾아냈는가? 그는 그 비밀을 무덤까지 가지고 가겠지만 그의 참모에 따르면 웹 스피너 본인이 그에게 고백했다고 한다. 모락 통조차도 그 검이 어떻게 메팔라와 관련되어 있는지 알 수 없다. 그녀의 신체적 형태의 연장인지, 그녀의 본질이 거기 묶여 있는 건지 확신할 수 없다. 하지만 그것이 그녀에게 중요하다는 것은 우리에게도 중요하다는 뜻이다.\n"
"\n"
"두 번째: 리비스는 야심에 가득 찬 인간으로, 모락 통의 가장 강력한 마법사였다. 그는 오른드라스가 은신처에서 검을 가져가는 것을 허락하지 않았다. 둘 사이에는 결투가 벌어졌고, 오른드라스가 검으로 리비스에게 상처를 내었을 때, 그는 리비스가 화염 주문으로 자신을 에워싸지 않는 것에 놀랐다. 그 검은 마법사를 침묵시키거나, 매지카의 흐름을 막거나 흡수하는 능력이 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"세 번째: 리비스는 여러 위험을 해쳐나간 전적이 있었고,  오른드라스보다 강력한 기술을 가지고 있었다. 하지만 오른드라스가 에보니 블레이드를 휘두르며 싸움을 계속하는 동안 그가 입은 상처는 저절로 치료되었다. 마치 상처를 입은 적이 없는 듯하였다. 분명 블레이드의 회복시키는 성질 때문일 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"네 번째: 리비스의 마지막 말은 \"우리 모두 결국에는 뱀파이어가 될 운명이다\"였다. 오른드라스는 그게 블레이드와 관련된 말이라고 믿었고, 리비스가 공포에 질려 검을 숨긴 것은 옳은 일이었다고 생각했다. 모락 통의 가장 충실한 일원조차도 궁지에 몰리면 모든 걸 불어 버릴 거라고 생각한다. 적어도 내 생각엔 그러하다.\n"
"\n"
"다섯 번째: 오른드라스는 검을 회수한 후 참모에게 보내는 자세한 보고서를 작성한 후, 그들을 몰살하려고 했다. 그는 한 명을 제외한 나머지 전원을 살해했다. 그의 행동은 눈에 보이는 이유도 동기도 없었다. 그는 황금꽃 3층에서 마지막으로 목격되었다.\n"

"Who is ALMSIVI?\n"
"\n"
"Morrowind is holy country, and its gods are flesh and blood. Collectively, these gods are called the Tribunal, the triune ALMSIVI, three deities exemplifying Dunmeri virtues. Almalexia is Mercy, Vivec is Mastery, and Sotha Sil is Mystery. Vivec is easily the most popular of them all. Vivec is also the most public, for he is the beloved Warrior-Poet of the True People, paradoxically beautiful and bloody. Vivec is an artistic violence. Vivec is represented in Temple literature and liturgy as one of the divine kings of Morrowind. He guards the sacred Velothi subcontinent of Vvardenfell, and stands guard over Red Mountain. He is part of the holy Tribunal, a god of the New Temple, and an aspect of the blessed and righteous ALMSIVI.\n"
"\n"
"This explicit presentation of Vivec the Guardian God-King and Warrior-Poet is the one most accessible and familiar to Westerners. However, it is important to remember that Vivec is also known to the Dunmer as the transcendent evolution of the Daedra that anticipated him, Black Hands Mephala, a foundation figure of the earliest Chimer. This darker side of Vivec does not appear in the popular literature and liturgy, but is instinctively understood and accepted by the Dunmer as an integral part of Vivec's divine aspect. A more complete appreciation of the complex nature of Vivec requires an understanding of the nature of Vivec's Anticipation, Mephala, and the darker themes represented by this Daedra Lord's modes and motivations.\n"
"\n"
"Who is Mephala?\n"
"\n"
"Each of the three Tribunes of the Temple were represented in the dawn of Chimeri culture by their Anticipations. These Anticipations are known to the West as the sinister Daedra Lords Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala. In Temple theology, however, Azura is the Anticipation of Sotha Sil, the Mage-Lord of Almsivi. Boethiah is the Anticipation of Almalexia, Almsivi's Mother and Lady. Mephala is the Anticipation of Vivec. According to legend, under the guidance of these three Daedra Lords, a discontented throng of Altmer transformed themselves into a new people and founded a new land. And while Boethiah, the so-called Prince of Plots, provided the revolutionary methods needed to bring about this transformation, Mephala was the shadowy implementer of those methods.\n"
"\n"
"As known in the West, Mephala is the demon of murder, sex, and secrets. All of these themes contain subtle aspects and violent ones (assassination/genocide, courtship/orgy, tact/poetic truths); Mephala is understood paradoxically to contain and integrate these contradictory themes. And all these subtle undercurrents and contradictions are present in the Dunmer concepts of Vivec, even if they are not explicitly described and explained in Temple doctrine.\n"
"\n"
"The Dunmer do not envision Lord Vivec as a creature of murder, sex, and secrets. Rather, they conceive of Lord Vivec as benevolent king, guardian warrior, poet-artist. But, at the same time, unconsciously, they accept the notion of darker, hidden currents beneath Vivec's benevolent aspects.\n"
"\n"
"For example, one of the most striking persistent myths associated with Vivec is the story that Vivec conspired with his co-rulers Almalexia and Sotha Sil in the murder of Lord Nerevar, the greatest of Dunmer heroes and generals. The story is derived from Ashlander oral tradition, and is flatly contradicted by all Temple traditions. Nonetheless, the tale is firmly established in the Dunmer imagination, as if to say, \"Of course Vivec would never have conspired to murder Lord Nerevar, but it happened so long ago … who can know the truth?\"\n"
"\n"
"The public face of Vivec is benign, sensitive, compassionate, and protective of his followers. At the same time, the Dunmer seem irrationally comfortable with the hidden aspects of Vivec, the darker components of violence, lust, and conspiracy associated with the more primitive and ruthless impulses of the Anticipations."

"성스러운 땅인 모로윈드에서는, 신들은 살과 뼈로 이루어진 육체를 지니고있다. 이들을 총합적으로 일컬는 말은 트라이뷰널이며,암시비의 삼위 일체라고 일컬으며, 던머들의 선한 세명의 신이라고도 불린다. 아말렉시아는 자비를, 비벡은 통제를, 그리고 소사실을 신비를 의미한다.그들중 대중적으로 인기가 있는 것은 비벡인데. 비벡이 백성들에게 사랑받는 시인이자 전사이며, 대중적인 이유는, 그가 역설적이게도 잔혹성과 아름다움 모두를 갖추고있기 때문일것이다.비벡의 전투는 예술적이다. 모로윈드의 신성한 왕들 중의 하나와 같이 비벡은 신전안의 문학과 예술을 대표한다.\n"
" 그는 바덴펠 대륙의 신성한 벨로스와 레드마운틴을 보호한다. 그는 신성한 트라이뷰널중의 하나이자, 새로운 신전의 신이며, 은혜를 배풀어 주시는, 공정한 암시비이다. \n"
"\n"
"서구인들에게는 수호자 신이자 왕 그리고 시인이자 전사 라는 표현이, 비벡을 가장 친근하며 가깝게 표현하는 단어일것이다.하지만 명심해야할것은 비벡은 던머에게  검은 손인 메팔라라는 데이드라가 진화한 형태이며,   가장 초창기의 카이머의 기초가 된 인물로 알려져있다.  이런 비벡의 어두운 면모는 대중적인 문학과 예배에서는 드러나지 않지만 비벡이 신으로써 중요한 또다른 측면의 그것을 던머들은 본능적으로 이해하고 받아들였다.  자연복합체인 비벡에 대한 감사를 완료하기 위해선 그의 혼 메팔라 그리고 더욱 어두운 면모인 데이드라 군주의 동기와 방법들에 대한 이해가 요구된다.\n"
"\n"
"메팔라는 누구인가?\n"
"\n"
"각각의 트라이뷰널는 그들의 예언대로  카이머의 새로운 앞날을 밝히는 선구자들이 되었다. 이들의 영혼들은 서구인들에게 ‘불길한 데이드라 군주’라 불리는 아주라, 보에시아,  그리고 메팔라로 알려졌다. 그러나 신학에 따르면 아주라는 암시비의 메이지 군주 소사 실의 혼이라고 알려져 있으며 , 보에시아는 암시비의 어머니인 레이디 아말렉시아의 혼이고,메팔라는 비벡의 혼이다. 전설에 따르면 이 세명의 데이드라 군주의 보호 아래에 있는 알트머중 불만이 있는 무리들은 스스로 새로운 사람으로 변해서 새로운 땅을 설립한다고 한다. \n"
"\n"
"음모의 왕자라고 불리는 보에시아가 불만세력 알트머들이 새로운 사람으로 변신하는 과정에 필요한, 아무도 시도하지 못했던 방법을 제공하는 동안 메팔라가 은밀히 그 방법을 구현하였다.  메팔라는 살인의, 섹스의, 그리고 비밀의 악귀로 서구에 알려져있다. 이 모든 것은 세분화 되어 있고 폭력적인것들도 포함되어 있다.(암살/대량학살, 구애/orgy-섹스를 포함하는 와일드한 파티, 재치/시, 진리..) 메팔라는 이 모순된 것들을 역설적으로 모든걸 통합해서 이해했다.\n"
"\n"
"이 모든 세부적인 소소한 사항, 모든 모순들까지도 현재의 비벡에 대한 개념으로, 던머들은 그들의 템플에서 가르쳐주거나 설명된 문서가 없음에도 그들은 알수있다. 던머들은 군주 비벡을 살인, 섹스, 그리고 비밀과 연관해서 상상조차 않는다. 대신 자애로운 왕, 수호자 전사, 시인으로 여긴다. 하지만 동시에 무의식적으로 자애로운 비벡의 숨겨진 어두운 면을 받아들이고 있다. \n"

"An Overview of Gods and Worship in Tamriel\n"
"\n"
"By Brother Hetchfeld, Associate Scribe at the Imperial University, Office of Introductory Studies\n"
"\n"
"Gods are commonly judged upon the evidence of their interest in worldly matters. A central belief in the active participation of Deities in mundane matters can be challenged by the reference to apparent apathy and indifference on the part of Gods during times of plague or famine.\n"
"\n"
"From intervention in legendary quests to manifestations in common daily life, no pattern for the Gods of Tamriel's activities is readily perceived. The concerns of Gods in many ways may seem unrelated or at best unconcerned with the daily trials of the mortal realm. The exceptions do exist, however.\n"
"\n"
"Many historical records and legends point to the direct intervention of one or more Gods at times of great need. Many heroic tales recount blessings of the divinity bestowed upon heroic figures who worked or quested for the good of a Deity or the Deity's temple. Some of the more powerful artifacts in the known world were originally bestowed upon their owners through such reward. It has also been reported that priests of high ranking in their temples may on occasion call upon their Deity for blessings or help in time of need. The exact nature of such contact and the blessings bestowed is given to much speculation, as the temples hold such associations secret and holy. This direct contact gives weight to the belief that the Gods are aware of the mortal realm. In many circumstances, however, these same Gods will do nothing in the face of suffering and death, seeming to feel no need to interfere. It is thus possible to conclude that we, as mortals, may not be capable of understanding more than a small fraction of the reasoning and logic such beings use.\n"
"\n"
"One defining characteristic of all Gods and Goddesses is their interest in worship and deeds. Deeds in the form of holy quests are just one of the many things that bring the attention of a Deity. Deeds in everyday life, by conforming to the statutes and obligations of individual temples, are commonly supposed to please a Deity. Performance of ceremony in a temple may also bring a Deity's attention. Ceremonies vary according to the individual Deity. The results are not always apparent, but sacrifice and offerings are usually required to have any hope of gaining a Deity's attention.\n"
"\n"
"While direct intervention in daily temple life has been recorded, the exact nature of the presence of a God in daily mundane life is a subject of controversy. A traditional saying of the Wood Elves is that, \"One man's miracle is another man's accident.\" While some Gods are believed to take an active part of daily life, others are well known for their lack of interest in temporal affairs.\n"
"\n"
"It has been theorized that Gods do in fact gain strength from such things as worship through praise, sacrifice, and deed. It may even be theorized that the number of worshipers a given Deity has may reflect on His overall position among the other Gods. This is my own conjecture, garnered from the apparent ability of the larger temples to attain blessings and assistance from their God with greater ease than smaller religious institutions.\n"
"\n"
"There are reports of the existence of spirits in our world that have the same capacity to use the actions and deeds of mortals to strengthen themselves as do the Gods. The understanding of the exact nature of such creatures would allow us to understand with more clarity the connection between a Deity and the Deity's worshipers.\n"
"\n"
"The implication of the existence of such spirits leads to the speculation that these spirits may even be capable of raising themselves to the level of a God or Goddess. Motusuo of the Imperial Seminary has suggested that these spirits may be the remains of Gods and Goddesses who through time lost all or most of their following, reverting to their earliest most basic form. Practitioners of the Old Ways say that there are no Gods, just greater and lesser spirits. Perhaps it is possible for all three theories to be true."

"탐리엘의 신들과 신앙 개론\n"
"\n"
"저자 헤치펠드 수도승은 임페리얼 대학의 소개학 (Introductory Studies)의 협력 서기관\n"
"\n"
"신들은 그들이 얼마나 세상적인 일에 관심을 가지느냐에 따라 판단되곤 한다. 평상시의 지루한 삶에서 신들이 직접적으로 간섭하는지에 대한 믿음은 전염병이나 흉년의 때에 신들의 무관심한 면에 의해 흔들릴 수도 있다.\n"
"\n"
"  전설적인 모험에 대한 간섭에서부터 평범한 일상에서의 출현까지, 탐리엘의 신들의 출현에는 일정한 양식이 없다. 신들의 관심은 여러가지 관점으로 봤을 때 일상적인 삶과 관련이 없거나, 매일 겪는 고난에는 관심을 가지지 않는 것 같아 보인다. 물론 예외는 존재한다. \n"
"\n"
"  많은 역사 기록이나 전설들은 한명이나 그 이상의 신들이 필요할 때 직접적으로 간섭한 사례를 보여준다. 많은 영웅담들에는 신들의 성스러운 축복이 영웅들에게 부여되고, 그들은 그 신들이나 신들의 신전을 위한 일이나 임무를 맡게 된다. 세상에 알려진 일부 강력한 유물들은 이러한 일을 통해 주인들에게 수여되다고 알려져 있다. 또한 고위 사제들은 도움을 요청하거나 필요할 때 이러한 축복을 부탁할 수도 있다는 보고들이 많다. 그것이 어떤 방식으로 이루어지는지, 혹은 어떻게 축복이 내려지는지는 아직 고찰해야 할 부분이 많다, 신전들은 이런 의식을 치룰 때 대부분 비밀스럽고 성스럽게 치르기 때문이다. 이 직접적인 만남은 신들이 아직 필멸자들의 일에 관심을 가지고 있다는 믿음을 주곤 한다. 하지만 대부분의 경우, 이 신들은 고난이나 죽음의 때에 아무런 일도 하지 않는다, 마치 그것은 그들이 관여할 필요가 없다고 느끼는 것 처럼 말이다. 때문에 우리는, 필멸자로서, 그들의 생각과 그들의 이성에 대해서 아주 일부만을 이해하고 있다고 결론을 지을 수 있다.\n"
"  \n"
"모든 신과 여신들의 공통적인 면이 한가지 있다면 그들은 그들을 경배하는 것과 행위에 관심이 있다는 것이다. 성스러운 임무를 받아 떠나는 것은 그들의 관심을 끌어당길 수 있는 여러가지 방법 중에 하나이다. 신전에서 신상을 숭배하는 행위는 일상생활에서 신들을 기쁘게 할 수 있는 가장 대중적인 방법이다. 신전에서 의식을 치르는 행위 또한 신들의 관심을 끌어들일 수 있다. 신들에 따라서 의식은 천차만별이다. 결과는 항상 눈으로 볼 수 있는 것은 아니지만 신들의 관심을 조금이나마 끌 수 있는 희망을 붙잡기 위해서는 보통 희생과 제물이 요구된다. \n"
"\n"
"  신전내에서의 삶에에 대한 직접적인 간섭은 기록되어있지만, 신이 평범한 일상에 나타나는지에 관한 여부는 아직도 논란거리로 남아있다. 우드엘프들의 속담중에는 \"한 사람의 기적은 다른 사람의 재난이다\" 라고 말한다. 어떤 신들은 매일의 삶에 중요한 역할을 담당하는가 하면, 어떤 신들은 일시적인 일에 별로 관심이 없는 것으로 잘 알려져 있다.\n"
"\n"
"  신들은 사실 이러한 찬양이나 희생, 그리고 행위를 통한 경배를 통해 힘을 얻는다는 설이 있다. 또한 신도들의 수에 따라서 신들의 순위가 매겨진다고 할 수도 있다. 이것은 내가 작은 종교 집단에서보다 대형 신전들에서는 축복과 신들의 도움을 더욱 쉽게 받을 수 있다는 점을 기반으로 한 추측이다.\n"
"\n"
"  신들이 하는 것처럼 필멸자들의 숭배를 받음으로 자기 자신을 강화하는 영혼들 또한 존재한다는 보고도 있다. 이런 생물의 성질을 이해한다면 신과 신의 숭배자들의 연결점을 찾는데 크나큰 도움이 될 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"  이러한 영혼들이 존재한다는 말은 이 영혼들이 어쩌면 신과 여신들과 동급으로 상승할 수도 있다는 추측을 할 수도 있다. 임페리얼 대학원 (Imperial Seminary)의 모투수오 (Motusuo)는 이 영혼들이 세월이 흐르는 동안 신도들을 잃어버린 신들이 가장 원초적인 모습으로 돌아간 것이라는 의견을 제시했다. 고대의 방식을 따르는 자들은 신은 없고, 다만 상위와 하위 정령이 있다고 말한다. 어쩌면 이 세가지 이론이 모두 맞을지도 모른다."

"By the intercession of St. Alessia, you may be so filled with grace, and the strength and wisdom that come from grace, that through these teachings you may come to the true meaning of the Eight Divines and Their glories. To convey to man's mind all the manifold subtleties of truth and virtue may not be done, were all the seas ink, and all the skies the parchment upon which Their wisdoms were writ. Yet Akatosh, in His wisdom, knowing how impatient is man, and how loath he is to travel upon the hard roads of truth, has allowed these nine simple commands to be made manifest with powerful clarity and concise definition.\n"
"\n"
"1. Stendarr says: Be kind and generous to the people of Tamriel. Protect the weak, heal the sick, and give to the needy.\n"
"\n"
"2. Arkay says: Honor the earth, its creatures, and the spirits, living and dead. Guard and tend the bounties of the mortal world, and do not profane the spirits of the dead.\n"
"\n"
"3. Mara says: Live soberly and peacefully. Honor your parents, and preserve the peace and security of home and family.\n"
"\n"
"4. Zenithar says: Work hard, and you will be rewarded. Spend wisely, and you will be comfortable. Never steal, or you will be punished.\n"
"\n"
"5. Kynareth says: Use Nature's gifts wisely. Respect her power, and fear her fury.\n"
"\n"
"6. Dibella says: Open your heart to the noble secrets of art and love. Treasure the gifts of friendship. Seek joy and inspiration in the mysteries of love.\n"
"\n"
"7. Julianos says: Know the truth. Observe the law. When in doubt, seek wisdom from the wise.\n"
"\n"
"8. Akatosh says: Serve and obey your Emperor. Study the Covenants. Worship the Eight, do your duty, and heed the commands of the saints and priests.\n"
"\n"
"9. The Eight say: Above all else, be good to one another.\n"
"\n"
"If only each man might look into the mirror of these Commands, and see reflected there the bliss that might enfold them, were he to serve in strict obedience to these Commands, he would be cast down and made contrite and humble. The obedient man may come to the altars of the Eight and be blessed, and may receive the comfort and healing of the Eight, and may give thanks for his manifold blessings.\n"
"\n"
"Heedless, the wicked man turns away, and forsaking the simple wisdoms granted to him by the All-Wise and All-Knowing Eight, he lives in sin and ignorance all the days of his life. He bears the awful burden of his crimes, and before Men and God his wickedness is known, and neither blessing nor comfort may he expect from the altars and shrines of the Eight.\n"
"\n"
"Yet the wicked and foolish are not doomed, for in their infinite mercies, the Eight have said, \"Repent, and do Good Works, and the Fountains of Grace shall once more spill forth upon you.\"\n"
"\n"
"Repent your crimes! Tender unto the Emperor the fines of gold, that they may be used to spread the Faith and its Benefits to all Men!\n"
"\n"
"Do yourself good works! Redeem your infamy by shining deeds! Show to all Men and the Eight the good Fame of the Righteous Man, and you may once again approach the altars and shrines of the Chapel to receive the comfort and blessings of the Eight."

"\"Anu encompassed and encompasses all things. So that he might know himself he created Anuiel, his soul and the soul of all things. Anuiel, as all souls, was given to self-reflection, and for this, he needed to differentiate between his forms, attributes, and intellects. Thus was born Sithis, who was the sum of all the limitations Anuiel would use to ponder himself. Anuiel, who was the soul of all things, therefore became many things, and this interplay was and is the Aurbis.\n"
"\n"
"\"At first the Aurbis was turbulent and confusing, as Anuiel's ruminations went on without design. Aspects of the Aurbis then asked for a schedule to follow or procedures whereby they might enjoy themselves a little longer outside of perfect knowledge. So that he might know himself this way, Anu created Auriel, the soul of his soul. Auriel bled through the Aurbis as a new force called time. With time, various aspects of the Aurbis began to understand their natures and limitations. They took names, like Magnus or Mara or Xen. One of these, Lorkhan, was more of a limit than a nature, so he could never last long anywhere.\n"
"\n"
"\"As he entered every aspect of Anuiel, Lorkhan would plant an idea that was almost wholly based on limitation. He outlined a plan to create a soul for the Aurbis, a place where the aspects of aspects might even be allowed to self-reflect. He gained many followers. Even Auriel, when told he would become the king of the new world, agreed to help Lorkhan. So they created the Mundus, where their own aspects might live and became the et'Ada.\n"
"\n"
"\"This was a trick. As Lorkhan knew, this world contained more limitations than not and was therefore hardly a thing of Anu at all. Mundus was the House of Sithis. As their aspects began to die off, many of the et'Ada vanished completely. Some escaped, like Magnus, and that is why there are no limitations to magic. Others, like Y'ffre, transformed themselves into the Ehlnofey, the Earthbones, so that the whole world might not die. Some had to marry and make children just to last. Each generation was weaker than the last, and soon there were Aldmer. Darkness caved in. Lorkhan made armies out of the weakest souls and named them Men, and they brought Sithis into every quarter.\n"
"\n"
"\"Auriel pleaded with Anu to take them back, but he had already filled their places with something else. His soul was gentler, granting Auriel his Bow and Shield, so that he might save the Aldmer from the hordes of Men. Some had already fallen, like the Chimer, who listened to tainted et'Ada, and others, like the Bosmer, had soiled Time's line by taking Mannish wives.\n"
"\n"
"\"Auriel could not save Altmora, the Elder Wood, and it was lost to Men. They were chased south and east to Old Ehlnofey, and Lorkhan was close behind. He shattered that land into many. Finally Trinimac, Auriel's greatest knight, knocked Lorkhan down in front of his army and reached in with more than hands to take his Heart. He was undone. The Men dragged Lorkhan's body away and swore blood vengeance on the heirs of Auriel for all time.\n"
"\n"
"\"But when Trinimac and Auriel tried to destroy the Heart of Lorkhan it laughed at them. It said, 'This Heart is the heart of the world, for one was made to satisfy the other.' So Auriel fastened the thing to an arrow and let it fly long into the sea, where no aspect of the new world may ever find it.\""

"\"하지만 이는 속임수였다. 로칸은 이를 알고 있었으나, 이 세상은 수많은 한계들로 가득차 아누의 존재들은 거의 존재하지 않거나 사라지는 지경에 이르렀다. 문두스는 시디스의 거주지였다. 그들의 존재들이 죽어감에 따라, 엣'아다의 다수가 완전히 사라졌다. 일부는 마그누스와 함께 탈출하였고, 이것이 마법에 대한 한계가 없어지는 계기가 되었다. 이-프레와 같은 다른 이들은 전체 세계가 무너지지 않도록 엘노페이 =  지구의 골격으로 자신들의 몸을 변환시켰다. 다른 일부는 단지 존재하기 위해 결혼하여 자식을 남겼다. 각 세대가 지날 수록 점점 약해져갔고, 곧 알드머가 생겨났다. 어둠이 붕괴되었다. 로칸은 가장 약한 영혼으로 군대를 만들었고, 그들을 인간이라 이름지었다. 이들은 매 분기마다 시디스를 불러내었다.\"\n"

"\"아우리엘은 아누에게 그들을 도로 회수해달라고 간청했지만 그가 이미 그들의 장소를 다른 어떤 것으로 채워버린뒤 벌어진 일이었다. 그러나 그의 영혼은 그 제안을 호의적으로 받아들여 인간의 무리로부터 알드머를 지킬 수 있도록 아우리엘에게 그의 활과 방패를 건네주었다. 몰락한 엣'아다를 받아들인 카이머나 인간의 부인을 둠으로써 시간의 흐름을 더럽힌 보스머 같은 일부는 이미 몰락한 뒤였다.\n"

"\"아우리엘은 오래된 숲 알트모라를 구할 수 없었다. 이것은 인간에 의해 손실되었다. 그들은 남쪽과 동쪽에서 고대 엘페노이 를 쫓아냈다. 그리고 로칸이 바로 뒤에 있었다. 그는 그 지역을 산산조각 내었다. 마침내 아우리엘의 위대한 기사인 트리니막이 로칸을 그의 군대 앞에 쓰러뜨렸고, 그의 심장에 닿기위해 애를 썼다. 결국 심장을 빼앗았지만 결판을 내지는 못하였다. 인간들이 로칸의 몸을 끌어당겼고, 아우리엘의 계승자들에게 영원한 피의 복수를 맹세하며 사라졌기 때문이다.\"\n"

"Subtitled \"The Psijic Compensation,\" \"Mythic Aurbis\" was an attempt by Artaeum apologists to explain the basics of Aldmeri religion to the Emperor. It quietly avoided any blame or bias against the Lorkhan Concept, which was still held in esteem by the Cyrodiils as \"Shezarr,\" the missing sibling of the Divines. Despite this, the Psijiici still give a nice summary of the Elder view, and it will serve our purposes here. This version comes from the archives of the Imperial Seminary from the handwritten notes of an unknown scribe.\n"
"\n"
"Mythic Aurbis exists, and has existed from time without measure, as a fanciful Unnatural Realm.\n"
"\n"
"\"Aurbis\" is used to connote the imperceptible Penumbra, the Gray Center between the IS/IS NOT of Anu and Padomay. It contains the multitude realms of Aetherius and Oblivion, as well as other, less structured forms.\n"
"\n"
"The magical beings of Mythic Aurbis live for a long time and have complex narrative lives, creating the patterns of myth.\n"
"\n"
"These are spirits made from bits of the immortal polarity. The first of these was Akatosh the Time Dragon, whose formation made it easier for other spirits to structure themselves. Gods and demons form and reform and procreate.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, the magical beings of Mythic Aurbis told the ultimate story: that of their own death. For some, this was an artistic transfiguration into the concrete, non-magical substance of the world. For others, this was a war in which all were slain, their bodies becoming the substance of the world. For yet others, this was a romantic marriage and parenthood with the parent spirits naturally having to die and give way to the succeeding mortal races.\n"
"\n"
"The agent of this communal decision was Lorkhan, whom most early myths vilify as a trickster or deceiver. More sympathetic versions of this story point out Lorkhan as being the reason the mortal plane exists at all.\n"
"\n"
"The magical beings created the races of the mortal Aurbis in their own image, either consciously as artists and craftsmen, or as the fecund rotting matter out of which the mortals sprung forth, or in a variety of other analogical senses.\n"
"\n"
"The magical beings, then, having died, became the et'Ada. The et'Ada are the things perceived and revered by the mortals as gods, spirits, or geniuses of Aurbis. Through their deaths, these magical beings separated themselves in nature from the other magical beings of the Unnatural realms.\n"
"\n"
"The Daedra were created at this time also, being spirits and Gods more attuned to Oblivion or that realm closer to the Void of Padomay. This act is the dawn of the Mythic (Merethic) Era. It has been perceived by the earliest mortals many different ways, either as a joyous \"second creation\" or (especially by the Elves) as a painful fracturing from the divine. The originator of the event is always Lorkhan."

" \n"
"마지막으로, 신화속의 어비스에 있는 마법적 존재들은 최종적인 이야기를 들려준다 : 그들 자신의 죽음에 대한 이야기이다. 이들 중 일부에게 죽음은 구체적 형상이 있고 세상의 비 마법적 물질로 예술적 변형을 하게 되는 것이다. 다른 일부에게는 전쟁 속의 죽음과 같이 그들의 몸이 세상의 기초가 되는 것이다. 나머지 다른 일부에게는 자연스럽게 죽어가며, 자손을 남겨야만 하는 필멸의 존재들이 부모정신과 함께 부모님이 되는 것 혹은 로맨틱한 결혼과 같다.\n"
" \n"
"이런 공동적 결정의 모든 신화에서 재간꾼 혹은 사기꾼으로 비난받는 로칸이다. 이 이야기에 좀 더 우호적인 논조로 쓰인 글은 로칸을 필멸의 평원이 존재하는 이유 그 자체라고 지적한다.\n"
" \n"
"마법적 존재들은 죽을 수 밖에 없는(필멸의 존재) 어비스의 종족들을 그들 자신의 형상으로 예술가나 장인과 같이, 혹은 그 종족들이 진보할 수 있을지에 대한 불필요한 걱정없이 풍부한 아이디어로, 또는 다른 유사한 감각들을 다양히 사용해 주의깊게 만들었다.\n"

"The Cyrodilic \"Shezarr's Song\"\n"
"\n"
"This was a new thing that Shezarr described to the Gods: becoming mothers and fathers, being responsible, and making great sacrifices with no guarantee of success, but Shezarr spoke beautifully to them and moved them beyond mystery and tears. Thus, the Aedra gave free birth to the world, the beasts, and the beings, making these things from parts of themselves. This free birth was very painful, and afterwards the Aedra were no longer young and strong and powerful, as they had been from the beginning of days.\n"
"\n"
"Some Aedra were disappointed and bitter in their loss and angry with Shezarr, and with all creation, for they felt Shezarr had lied and tricked them. These Aedra, the Gods of the Aldmer, led by Auri-El, were disgusted by their enfeebled selves and by what they had created. \"Everything is spoiled, for now and for all time, and the most we can do is teach the Elven Races to suffer nobly with dignity, chastise ourselves for our folly, and avenge ourselves upon Shezarr and his allies.\" Thus are the Gods of the Elves dark and brooding, and thus are the Elves ever dissatisfied with mortality, always proud and stoic despite the harshness of this cruel and indifferent world.\n"
"\n"
"Other Aedra looked upon creation and were well pleased. These Aedra, the Gods of Men and Beast Folk, led by Akatosh, praised and cherished their wards, the Mortal Races. \"We have suffered and are diminished for all time, but the mortal world we have made is glorious, filling our hearts and spirits with hope. Let us teach the Mortal Races to live well, to cherish beauty and honor, and to love one another as we love them.\" Thus are the Gods of Men tender and patient, and thus are Men and Beast Folk great in heart for joy or suffering and ambitious for greater wisdom and a better world.\n"
"\n"
"Now when the Daedra Lords heard Shezarr, they mocked him, and the other Aedra. \"Cut parts of ourselves off? And lose them? Forever? That's stupid! You'll be sorry! We are far smarter than you, for we will create a new world out of ourselves, but we will not cut it off, or let it mock us, but we will make this world within ourselves, forever ours, and under our complete control.\"\n"
"\n"
"So the Daedra Lords created the Daedric Realms, and all the ranks of Lesser Daedra, great and small. And, for the most part, the Daedra Lords were well pleased with this arrangement, for they always had worshipers and servants and playthings close to hand. At the same time, they sometimes looked with envy upon the Mortal Realms, for though mortals were foul and feeble and contemptible, their passions and ambitions were also far more surprising and entertaining than the antics of the Lesser Daedra. Thus do the Daedra Lords court and seduce certain amusing specimens of the Mortal Races, especially the passionate and powerful. It gives the Daedra Lords special pleasure to steal away from Shezarr and the Aedra the greatest and most ambitious mortals. \"Not only are you fools to mutilate yourselves,\" gloat the Daedra Lords, \"but you cannot even keep the best pieces, which prefer the glory and power of the Daedra Lords to the feeble vulgarity of the mush-minded Aedra.\""

"\n"
"This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri \"Lorkhan,\" or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the Mortal Plane, upsetting the status quo much like his father Padomay had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. Interpretations of these events differ widely by culture. Below is one of the better known.\n"

"Yokudan, \"Satakal the Worldskin\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Satak was First Serpent, the Snake who came Before, and all the worlds to come rested in the glimmer of its scales. But it was so big there was nothing but, and thus it was coiled around and around itself, and the worlds to come slid across each other but none had room to breathe or even be. And so the worlds called to something to save them, to let them out, but of course there was nothing outside the First Serpent, so aid had to come from inside it, and this was Akel, the Hungry Stomach. Akel made itself known, and Satak could only think about what it was, and it was the best hunger, so it ate and ate. Soon there was enough room to live in the worlds and things began. These things were new and they often made mistakes, for there was hardly time to practice being things before. So most things ended quickly or were not good or gave up on themselves. Some things were about to start, but they were eaten up as Satak got to that part of its body. This was a violent time.\n"
"\n"
"\"Pretty soon Akel caused Satak to bite its own heart and that was the end. The hunger, though, refused to stop, even in death, and so the First Serpent shed its skin to begin anew. As the old world died, Satakal began, and when things realized this pattern so did they realize what their part in it was. They began to take names, like Ruptga or Tu'whacca, and they strode about looking for their kin. As Satakal ate itself over and over, the strongest spirits learned to bypass the cycle by moving at strange angles. They called this process the Walkabout, a way of striding between the worldskins. Ruptga was so big that he was able to place the stars in the sky so that weaker spirits might find their way easier. This practice became so easy for the spirits that it became a place, called the Far Shores, a time of waiting until the next skin.\n"
"\n"
"\"Ruptga was able to sire many children through the cycles, and so he became known as the Tall Papa. He continued to place stars to map out the void for others, but after so many cycles, there were almost too many spirits to help out. He made himself a helper from the detritus of past skins, and this was Sep, or the Second Serpent. Sep had much of the Hungry Stomach still left in him, multiple hungers from multiple skins. He was so hungry he could not think straight. Sometimes he would just eat the spirits he was supposed to help, but Tall Papa would always reach in and take them back out. Finally, tired of helping Tall Papa, Sep went and gathered the rest of the old skins and balled them up, tricking spirits to help him, promising them this was how you reached the new world, by making one out of the old. These spirits loved this way of living, as it was easier. No more jumping from place to place. Many spirits joined in, believing this was good thinking. Tall Papa just shook his head.\n"
"\n"
"\"Pretty soon the spirits on the skin-ball started to die, because they were very far from the real world of Satakal. And they found that it was too far to jump into the Far Shores now. The spirits that were left pleaded with Tall Papa to take them back. But grim Ruptga would not, and he told the spirits that they must learn new ways to follow the stars to the Far Shores now. If they could not, then they must live on through their children, which was not the same as before. Sep, however, needed more punishment, and so Tall Papa squashed the Snake with a big stick. The hunger fell out of Sep's dead mouth and was the only thing left of the Second Serpent. While the rest of the new world was allowed to strive back to godhood, Sep could only slink around in a dead skin, or swim about in the sky, a hungry void that jealously tried to eat the stars.\""

"\"In Mundus, conflict and disparity are what bring change, and change is the most sacred of the Eleven Forces. Change is the force without focus or origin.\"\n"
"— Oegnithr, Taheritae, Order of PSJJJJ\n"
"\n"
"Simply put, the schism in the Human/Aldmeri worldview is the mortal's relationship to the divine. Humans take the humble path that they were created by the immortal forces, while the Aldmer claim descent from them. It doesn't seem like much, but it is a distinction that colors the rest of their diverging mythologies.\n"
"\n"
"All Tamrielic religions begin the same. Man or mer, things begin with the dualism of Anu and His Other. These twin forces go by many names: Anu-Padomay, Anuiel-Sithis, Ak-El, Satak-Akel, Is-Is Not. Anuiel is the Everlasting Ineffable Light, Sithis is the Corrupting Inexpressible Action. In the middle is the Gray Maybe (or \"Nirn\" in the Ehlnofex).\n"
"\n"
"In most cultures, Anuiel is honored for his part of the interplay that creates the world, but Sithis is held in highest esteem because he's the one that causes the reaction. Sithis is thus the Original Creator, an entity who intrinsically causes change without design. Even the Hist acknowledge this being.\n"
"\n"
"Anuiel is also perceived of as Order, opposed to the Sithis-Chaos. Perhaps it is easier for mortals to envision change than perfect stasis, for often Anuiel is relegated to the mythic background of Sithis' fancies. In Yokudan folk-tales, which are among the most vivid in the world, Satak is only referred to a handful of times, as \"the Hum\"; he is a force so prevalent as to be not really there at all.\n"
"\n"
"In any case, from these two beings spring the et'Ada, or Original Spirits. To humans these et'Ada are the Gods and Demons; to the Aldmer, the Aedra/Daedra, or the \"Ancestors.\" All of the Tamrielic pantheons fill their rosters from these et'Ada, though divine membership often differs from culture to culture. Like Anu and Padomay, though, every one of these pantheons contains the archetypes of the Dragon God and the Missing God.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Dragon God and the Missing God\n"
"\n"
"The Dragon God is always related to Time and is universally revered as the \"First God.\" He is often called Akatosh, \"whose perch from Eternity allowed the day.\" He is the central God of the Cyrodilic Empire.\n"
"\n"
"The Missing God is always related to the Mortal Plane and is a key figure in the Human/Aldmeri schism. The \"missing\" refers to either his palpable absence from the pantheon (another mental distress that is interpreted a variety of ways), or the removal of his \"divine spark\" by the other immortals. He is often called Lorkhan, and his epitaphs are many, equally damnable and devout.\n"
"\n"
"Note that Tamriel and the Mortal Plane do not exist yet. The Gray Maybe is still the playground of the Original Spirits. Some are more bound to Anu's light, others to the unknowable void. Their constant flux and interplay increase their number, and their personalities take long to congeal. When Akatosh forms, Time begins, and it becomes easier for some spirits to realize themselves as beings with a past and a future. The strongest of the recognizable spirits crystallize: Mephala, Arkay, Y'ffre, Magnus, Ruptga, etc., etc. Others remain as concepts, ideas, or emotions. One of the strongest of these, a barely formed urge that the others call Lorkhan, details a plan to create Mundus, the Mortal Plane.\n"
"\n"
"Humans, with the exception of the Redguards, see this act as a divine mercy, an enlightenment whereby lesser creatures can reach immortality. Aldmer, with the exception of the Dark Elves, see this act as a cruel deception, a trick that sundered their connection to the spirit plane."

" \n"
" 인간 /알드메리의 세계관에서 분파는 죽어가는 이들의 성령에 대한 관계이다. 인간은 그들이 불멸의 존재로부터 만들어진 겸손의 길을 택하는 반면, 알드머는 그들로부터 떨어지기를 주장하였다. 이것은 반드시 그렇다고 할 수는 없지만 그것은 그들의 나머지 갈라진 신화들에 영향을 끼치는 구분이다.\n"
" \n"
"모든 탐리엘종교의 시작은 유사하다. 인간과 엘프의 구분은 아누와 그 나머지의 이중성에서 시작된다. 이 한쌍의 힘은 많은 이름을 가진다. : 아누-파도메이 , 아누이엘 - 시디스 , 아크-엘, 사탁-아켈 , 존재-부재 와 같은 것이다. 아누이엘은 영원히 존재하는 거룩한 빛이다. 시디스는 표현할 수 없는 타락한 행동이다. 그 사이에 회색 구역인 '넌 ' 엘페노어 언어로는 '니른'이 있다.\n"
" \n"
"대부분의 문화에서, 아누이엘은 세계를 만드는데 기여한 데에 칭송을 받는다. 하지만 시디스는 그가 반작용을 유발하는 유일한 자기 때문에 가장 최고의 존경을 받는다. 시디스는 따라서 계획되지 않은 변화를 본질적으로 유발하는 존재자로서 근원적 창조자이다. 심지어 히스트 도 이를 인정한다.\n"
" \n"
"아누이엘은 또한 시디스의 혼란에 대항하는 주재자로써 인지된다. 아마도 필멸자들에게는 완벽한 정체상태보다는 변화를 구상하는 것이 쉬울 것이다, 종종 아누이엘은 시디스 신화의 미신적 배경으로 격하되기도 한다. 세계에서 가장 실감나는 것중 하나인 요쿠다 설화에서는 사탁이 \"the Hum\"으로 아주 잠깐 등장한다. - 그것은 널리 알려진 힘이라서 그 설화에 실제로 등장하지는 않았을 수 있다.\n"
" \n"
"어쨋든 엣'아다 나 근원적 영혼들은 이 두 존재로부터 시작되었다. 인간에게 이 엣'아다는 신이고 악마이다. 반면에 알드머에게는  에이드라와 데이드라, 혹은 조상이다. 탐리엘의 신전들은 비록 문화에 따라 그 구성이 다를지라도, 전부 엣'아다를 섬기고 있다. 아누와 파도메이와 같이 이 판테온들은 드래곤 신과 잊혀진 신의 조형물을 포함하고 있다.\n"
" \n"
"드래곤 신과 잊혀진 신\n"
" \n"
"드래곤 신은 항상 시간과 연관된다. 그리고 \"최초의 신\"으로써 전우주적으로 숭배된다. 그는 종종 \"영원의 횃대가 허락한 날\"이란 의미의 아카토쉬 라 불린다. 그는 시로딜 제국의 중심적인 신이다.\n"
" \n"
"잊혀진 신 은 항상 필멸의 평원과 연관된다. 그리고 인간과 알드메리 분파의 열쇠이다. 'Missing'은 그의 판테온에서 감지할 수 있는 부재 (다양한 방식으로 해석될 수 있는 또다른 정신적 고통), 혹은 다른 불멸자들에 의한 그의 '성스러운 불꽃'의 제거를 의미한다. 그는 종종 로칸이라 불린다. 그의 시호는 저주의 존재이기도 하며 동시에 신앙의 대상으로 다양하게 존재한다. 탐리엘과 필멸의 평원에 관해 언급된 문건은 존재하지 않는다. 회색구역은 여전히 근원적 영혼들의 놀이터이다. 일부는 아누의 빛에 얽매여 있고 다른 일부는 알 수 없는 공허감에 사로잡혀 있다. 그들의 끊임없는 변화와 상호작용은 그들의 수를 늘이고 있고, 그들의 개성은 고착되는데 오래 걸린다. 아카토쉬가 형성된 때, 시간은 흐르기 시작했고, 일부 정신들은 과거와 미래로써의 자신들을 인식하기 쉬워졌다. 인식가능한 정신들의 가장 강한 것들이 결정화 되었다.: 메팔라, 아케이, 이'프레 , 마그누스 , 룹트가 , 기타 등등. 나머지들은 개념과 아이디어, 감정으로 남아 있었다. 그들 중 가장 강력한  존재이자, 다른 존재들은 로칸이라 부르는 갓 생성된 그 힘이 문두스 , 필멸자의 평원을 형성하는 기초를 세세하게 계획했다.\n"
" \n"
"레드가드를 예외로 인간은 이 상황을 성스러운 자비와 덜떨어진 생명체들을 불멸에 이를 수 있게 해주는 계몽으로 인식하였다. 다크엘프를 예외로 알드머는 이 상황을 영혼의 평원과의 연결을 끊어버리는 잔인한 기만으로 여겼다."

"I will not go into the varying accounts of what happened at Adamantine Tower, nor will I relate the War of Manifest Metaphors that rendered those stories unable to support most qualities of what is commonly known as \"narrative.\" We all have our favorite Lorkhan story and our favorite Lorkhan motivation for the creation of Nirn, as well as our favorite story of what happened to His Heart, but the Theory of the Lunar Lorkhan is of special note.\n"
"\n"
"In short, the Moons were and are the two halves of Lorkhan's \"flesh-divinity.\" Like the rest of the Gods, Lorkhan was a plane(t) that participated in the Great Construction … except where the Eight lent portions of their heavenly bodies to create the mortal plane(t), Lorkhan's was cracked asunder and his divine spark fell to Nirn as a shooting star \"to impregnate it with the measure of its existence and a reasonable amount of selfishness.\"\n"
"\n"
"Masser and Secunda therefore are the personifications of the dichotomy—the \"Cloven Duality,\" according to Artaeum—that Lorkhan legends often rail against: ideas of the anima/animus, good/evil, being/nothingness, the poetry of the body, throat, and moan/silence-as-the-abortive, and so on, all set in the night sky as Lorkhan's constant reminder to his mortal issue of their duty.\n"
"\n"
"Followers of this theory hold that all other \"Heart Stories\" are mythical degradations of the true origin of the moons (and it needn't be said that they observe the \"hollow crescent theory\" as well)."

" \n"
"간단히 표현하자면, 달들은 로칸의 '성스러운 육체'의 절반이라는 것이다. 다른 신들과 마찬가지로, 로칸은 위대한 창조의 때에 참가했던 행성이다. 하지만 필멸자들의 세상을 구축하는데 사용되었던 성스러운 몸은 총 여덟 개였다.로칸의 것은 \"그 존재(행성)의 가치를 느끼고 어느 정도의 이기심도 느끼는 존재들을 수태시키기 위해\" 넌 행성으로 별똥별처럼 떨어졌다.\n"

"The first ones were brothers: Anu and Padomay. They came into the Void, and Time began.\n"
"\n"
"As Anu and Padomay wandered the Void, the interplay of Light and Darkness created Nir. Both Anu and Padomay were amazed and delighted with her appearance, but she loved Anu, and Padomay retreated from them in bitterness.\n"
"\n"
"Nir became pregnant, but before she gave birth, Padomay returned, professing his love for Nir. She told him that she loved only Anu, and Padomay beat her in rage. Anu returned, fought Padomay, and cast him outside Time. Nir gave birth to Creation, but died from her injuries soon after. Anu, grieving, hid himself in the sun and slept.\n"
"\n"
"Meanwhile, life sprang up and flourished on the twelve worlds of creation. After many ages, Padomay returned to Time. He saw Creation and hated it. He swung his sword, shattering the twelve worlds in their alignment. Anu awoke and fought Padomay again. The long and furious battle ended with Anu as the victor. He cast aside the body of his brother, who he believed was dead, and attempted to save Creation by forming the remnants of the twelve worlds into one: Nirn, the world of Tamriel. As he was doing so, Padomay struck him through the chest with one last blow. Anu grappled with his brother and pulled them both outside of Time forever.\n"
"\n"
"The blood of Padomay became the Daedra. The blood of Anu became the stars. The mingled blood of both became the Aedra (as evinced by their capacity for good and evil, as well as their greater affinity for earthly affairs than the Daedra, who have no connection to Creation.)\n"
"\n"
"On the world of Nirn, all was chaos. The only survivors of the twelve worlds of Creation were the Ehlnofey and the Hist. The Ehlnofey are the ancestors of Mer and Men. The Hist are the trees of Argonia. Nirn originally was all land, interspersed with seas, but no oceans.\n"
"\n"
"A large fragment of the Ehlnofey world landed on Nirn relatively intact, and the Ehlnofey living there were the ancestors of the Mer. These Ehlnofey fortified their borders from the chaos outside, hid their pocket of calm, and attempted to live on as before. Other Ehlnofey arrived on Nirn scattered amid the confused jumble of the shattered worlds, wandering and finding each other over the years. Eventually, the wandering Ehlnofey found the hidden land of Old Ehlnofey, and were amazed and joyful to find their kin living amid the splendor of ages past. The wandering Ehlnofey expected to be welcomed into the peaceful realm, but the Old Ehlnofey looked on them as degenerates fallen from their former glory. For whatever reason, war broke out, and raged across the whole of Nirn. The Old Ehlnofey retained their ancient power and knowledge, but the Wanderers were more numerous, toughened by their long struggle to survive on Nirn. This war reshaped the face of Nirn, sinking much of the land beneath new oceans and leaving the lands as we know them: Tamriel, Akavir, Atmora, and Yokuda. The Old Ehlnofey realm, although ruined, became Tamriel. The remnants of the Wanderers were left divided on the other three continents.\n"
"\n"
"Over many years, the Ehlnofey of Tamriel became the Mer (Elves),\n"
"\n"
"the Dwemer (the Deep Ones, sometimes called Dwarves),\n"
"\n"
"the Chimer (the Changed Ones, who later became the Dunmer),\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"the Bosmer (the Green or Forest Ones, the Wood Elves),\n"
"\n"
"the Altmer (The Elder or High Ones, the High Elves).\n"
"\n"
"On the other continents, the Wandering Ehlnofey became the Men: the Nords of Atmora, the Redguards of Yokuda, and the Tsaesci of Akavir.\n"
"\n"
"The Hist were bystanders in the Ehlnofey War, but most of their realm was destroyed as the war passed over it. A small corner of it survived to become Black Marsh in Tamriel, but most of their realm was sunk beneath the sea.\n"

"Eventually, Men returned to Tamriel. The Nords were the first, colonizing the northern coast of Tamriel before recorded history, led by the legendary Ysgramor. The thirteenth of his line, King Harald, was the first to appear in written history.\n"

And thereafter did Long-Launcher sigh when it was borne, and moan when it was shot. And Ysgramor decided to take it hunting. \n"

"And he hunted and slew much game in the Atmoran Frostwood, until he paused at a ford to drink his fill. Then across the stream bounded the White Stag of Forelgrim, and Ysgramor shot at it and missed, which in no wise pleased him, and he swore to pursue the White Stag until it fell to him.

"Among those of us to whom Lord Hircine bestowed his most precious gift of Lycanthropy, there are legends that he also set into the world specific artifacts of his power. They date to a period when men could neither write, nor speak, nor barely think, but the powers of blood of the beast were yet flowing strong among the selected.\n"

"\n"
"The third: a simple drum, its mundane appearance meaning it is most likely lost to the mists of long ago time. As our fathers would beat time to summon their brethren from the fields, so too would our forebears in the blood call their allies to them with its pounding.\n"

"Through these totems, we channel and focus our energies of the beast.

"A brief account of Lamae Bal and the Restless Death\n"
"\n"
"Mabei Aywenil, Scribe\n"
"\n"
"Translation by University of Gwylim Press; 2E 105\n"
"\n"
"As brighter grows light, darker becomes shadow. So it passed that the Daedra Molag Bal looked on Arkay and thought the Aedra prideful of his dominion o'er the death of man and mer, and it was sooth.\n"
"\n"
"Bal, whose sphere is the wanton oppression and entrapment of mortal souls, sought to thwart Arkay, who knew that not man, nor mer, nor beastfolk of all Nirn could escape eventual death. The Aedra was doubtless of his sphere, and so Molag Bal set upon Nirn to best death.\n"
"\n"
"Tamriel was still young, and filled with danger and wondrous magic when Bal walked in the aspect of a man and took a virgin, Lamae Beolfag, from the Nedic Peoples. Savage and loveless, Bal profaned her body, and her screams became the Shrieking Winds, which still haunt certain winding fjords of Skyrim. Shedding a lone droplet of blood on her brow, Bal left Nirn, having sown his wrath.\n"
"\n"
"Violated and comatose, Lamae was found by nomads, and cared for. A fortnight hence, the nomad wyrd-woman enshrouded Lamae in pall for she had passed into death. In their way, the nomads built a bonfire to immolate the husk. That night, Lamae rose from her funeral pyre, and set upon the coven, still aflame. She ripped the throats of the women, ate the eyes of the children, and raped their men as cruelly as Bal had ravished her.\n"
"\n"
"And so Lamae, (who is known to us as blood-matron) imprecated her foul aspect upon the folk of Tamriel, and begat a brood of countless abominations, from which came the vampires, most cunning of the night-horrors. And so was the scourge of undeath wrought upon Tamriel, cruelly mocking Arkay's rhythm of life and death through all the coming eras of the et'Ada, and for all his sadness, Arkay knew this could not be undone."

"A Study of Daedra Worship\n"
"\n"
"by Haderus of Gottlesfont\n"
"\n"
"Daedra worship is not prohibited by law in Cyrodiil. Primarily, this is a result of the Imperial Charter granted the Mages Guild permitting the summoning of Daedra. Nonetheless, chapel and public opinion is so strongly against Daedra worship that those who practice Daedric rituals do so in secret.\n"
"\n"
"However, opinions about Daedra worship differ widely in other provinces. Even in Cyrodiil, traditional opinions have changed greatly over the years, and some communities that worship Daedra survive. Some more traditional Daedra worshipers are motivated by piety and personal conviction; while many modern Daedra worshipers are motivated by a lust for arcane power. In particular, questing heroes of all stripes seek after fabled Daedric artifacts for their potent combat and magical benefits.\n"
"\n"
"I personally discovered one community worshiping the Daedra Lord Azura, Queen of Dawn and Dusk. A researcher curious about Daedra worship might investigate in several ways: through a study of the literature, through exploration and discovery of ancient Daedric shrines, through questioning local informants, or through questioning worshipers themselves. I used all these means to discover the shrine of Azura.\n"
"\n"
"First, I read books. References like this one may provide a helpful general background concerning Daedric shrines. For example, my researches led me to understand that in Cyrodiil, Daedric shrines are generally represented by statues of Daedra Lords. They are generally situated in wilderness locations far from settlements. Each shrine generally has associated with it a community of worshipers, often referred to as a \"coven.\" Shrines have associated with them a particular time, often a day of the week, when a Daedra Lord might be solicited. A Daedra Lord will usually not deign to respond unless they regard a petitioner of sufficient prowess or strength of character. They will only respond if given the proper offering, the secret of which offering is often known only to the community of worshipers. In return for the completion of some task or service, the Daedra Lord will often undertake to offer an artifact of power to a successful quester.\n"
"\n"
"Then I questioned locals with an intimate knowledge of the wilderness. Two classes of informants I found especially useful: well-traveled adventurers (who might come across shrines in their travels), and scholars of the Mages Guild. In the case of the Shrine of Azura, both sources were profitable. I discovered a Cheydinhal hunter who had chanced across a strange epic statue in his travels. It depicted a woman with outstretched arms. In one hand, she held a star; in the other hand, she held a crescent moon. He had shunned the statue out of superstitious fear, but had marked the location in memory: far north of Cheydinhal, northwest of Lake Arrius, high in the Jerall Mountains. After proceeding to the local Mages Guild with a description of the statue, I was able to confirm from its description the identity of the Daedra Lord worshiped.\n"
"\n"
"Having discovered the location of the shrine, I visited it and discovered there the community of worshipers. Because of the strength of opinion against Daedra worship, the worshipers were at first reluctant to admit their identity. After I had won their trust, they were willing to divulge to me the secrets of the times when Azura would hear petitions (from dusk to dawn), and that the offering required by Azura was glow dust, a substance obtained from the will-o-the-wisp.\n"
"\n"
"I am, of course, nothing more than a scholar, so it did not lie within my power to find a will-o-the-wisp to obtain glow dust. Nor am I certain that Azura would have found me worthy to make such an offering, even had I proffered it. Despite this, I was assured that if I had been able to make such an offering, and if it had been accepted, Azura would have given me some sort of quest. Upon its completion, I might have earned the reward of Azura's Star, a Daedric artifact of legendary magical powers.\n"
"\n"
"I have since heard rumors of the existence in Cyrodiil of several other Daedric shrines, the Daedric Lords to which they are dedicated, and the Daedric artifacts that might be won by questing heroes. Hircine the Huntsman, for example, is linked in legend to the Savior's Hide, a powerful enchanted armor. The hammer Volendrung is associated with Malacath, Lord of Monsters, and the eponymously named Mace of Molag Bal is also thought to be the object of Daedra worship. Other Daedra Lords, their shrines, and their worshipers remain to be discovered by earnest and persistent researchers."

"데이드라 숭배가 시로딜의 법으로 금지되어 있지는 않다. \n"
"주된 이유로 메이지길드의 데이드라 소환을 허락한 제국헌장의 결과이다.\n"
"그렇지만 교단과 대중의 의견은 암암리에 데이드릭 의식을 행하는 데이드라 숭배자들을 완강하게 거부하고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"그러나 타 지역의 데이드라 숭배에 대한 의견은 제각각으로 다른데, 시로딜에서도 세월의 흐름과 살아남은 데이드라 숭배집단에 의해 많은 변화가 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"신앙심과 개인적 신념에 고무된 데이드라전통의 숭배자들이 늘어나고 있는데(현세의 다수 데이드라숭배자들은 신비로운 힘에 대한 욕망에 도취되어 있다), 개중에는 관록을 쌓기위해 강력한 전투와 마력이 제공되는 전설속 데이드릭 유물을 찾아나선 영웅들도 있다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 개인적으로 여명과 황혼의 여왕인 데이드라 군주 \"아주라\"의 숭배자들을 찾아낸 적이 있다. \n"
"데이드릭 숭배에 대해 궁금한 연구자에게 탐구가 가능하게 하는 몇몇 방법이 있는데, 문서적 연구나, 고대 데이드릭 성지를 발로 찾아 나서거나, 지역별 정보제공자를 통하거나, 숭배자들 자체에게 질문하는 것이다. 나는 아주라의 성지를 찾기위해 이 방법들을 모두 동원했었다.\n"
"\n"
"우선 나는 이 책처럼 데이드릭 성지와 관련된 일반적 배경에 도움이 될만한 참고서적들을 읽었다. \n"
"내 조사들은 그들에 대한 여러가지를 이해하도록 이끌었다.\n"
"예를 들면, 시로딜에서 데이드릭 성지들은 보통 데이드릭 군주의 조각상으로 현시되며, 대부분 거주지역에서 멀리 떨어진 야지에 자리하고, 각각의 숭배집단을 갖고있는 게 일반적으로 종종 마녀집회처럼 간주되기도 한다는 것, 그들은 주로 한주에 하루정도 데이드릭 군주가 응답을 보여줄만한 특정한 시간대에 보이곤 한다는 것, 대개 데이드릭 군주들은 기량이 뛰어나거나 강건한 기질을 갖췄으리라 여겨지는 자가 요청하지 않으면 응답하지 않곤 한다던가, 제대로 된 공물(공물에 대한 비밀은 숭배자들만 알고 있는 것이 보통이다.)을 바쳤을 경우에만 응답한다는 것, 그리고 임무를 성공적으로 완료한 모험가에게 답례로 마력의 유물을 내어주곤 한다는 것 등이다.\n"
"\n"
"그 후 나는 지역민들에게 황무지에 관한 상세한 정보를 캐묻고 다녔다.\n"
"그 중 특별히 쓸만한 두 부류를 찾아냈는데 각지를 돌아다닌 사냥꾼, 모험가들이나(여행중 우연히 성지에 다가가게 되었으리라.) 메이지길드의 학자들로, \"아주라\" 성지의 경우엔 양쪽 모두 유용했다.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"자신의 여행중에 우연히 낯설고 웅장한 조각상에 다가간 셰이딘홀의 사냥꾼을 찾게되었다.\n"
"조각상은 양팔을 넓게 편 여인으로 한 팔에는 별을, 다른 한 팔엔 초승달을 들고 있었다.\n"
"그는 미신적인 공포에 쌓여 피해나왔지만 위치는 기억에 남아 있었다. \n"
"셰이딘홀의 북쪽 끝, 레이크 아리우스(아리우스 호수)의 북서쪽 제럴산맥 높은 곳이었다.\n"
"이어 조각상에 대한 기술을 들고 메이지길드를 찾아가서 기술된 것으로부터 숭배받는 데이드릭 군주의 정체를 확인할 수 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"알려진 위치로 찾아가서는 그 숭배자 집단을 찾을 수 있었다.\n"
"데이드라 숭배에 대한 반감을 의식해서인지 처음엔 그들 자신의 정체를 밝히기 꺼리는 듯 했지만 그들의 신뢰를 얻고 나니 아주라가 청원을 들어주는 시간대(황혼부터 여명까지)와 공물로 바쳐야 할 것은 \"윌-오-위습\"에서 얻어지는 \"글로우 더스트\"란 것 등을 귀뜸해주었다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 물론 성직자이자 학자이상은 아니다. 내 능력으로 \"윌-오-위습\"의 \"글로우 더스트\"를 찾겠다는 게 거짓은 아니지만 그것을 들이민다 한들 아주라가 나를 봉헌자로 가치매김 할 지도 확실하진 않았다.\n"
"\n"
"하지만 나는 공물을 마련하면 받아들여질 것이고 아주라가 준 임무를 완수해서 전설적인 마력의 데이드릭 유물, 아주라의 별을 보상으로 얻을 수 있을 것이라 장담했었다.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"이래로 시로딜에는 다른 몇몇 데이드릭 성지과, 숭배자들에게 추앙받는 데이드릭 군주들, 주어진 모험을 완료한 영웅에게 주어질 데이드릭 유물이 현존한다는 소문을 들었다.\n"
"\n"
"예로 \"사냥꾼 허씬\"은 강한 마력이 부여된 \"구원자의 가죽\"(사비올의 하이드)과 연결되어 있다던가, \"볼렌드렁\" 이란 검은 몬스터의 군주 \"말라카스\"와 관련이 있다던가, 주인의 이름을 딴 \"몰락발의 둔기(메이스)\" 역시 데이드라 숭배의 것이라던가 하는 것 들이다.\n"
"\n"
"다른 데이드라 군주들, 그들의 성지와 숭배자들은 불굴의 탐구자들에게 발견되길 기다리며 시로딜에 남아있다."

"For three hundred years, I have been a priestess of Azura, the Daedric Prince of Moonshadow, Mother of the Rose, and Queen of the Night Sky. Every Hogithum, which we celebrate on the 21st of First Seed, we summon her for guidance, as well as to offer things of worth and beauty to Her Majesty. She is a cruel but wise mistress. We do not invoke her on any Hogithum troubled by thunderstorms, for those nights belong to the Mad One, Sheogorath, even if they do coincide with the occasion. Azura at such times understands our caution.\n"
"\n"
"Azura's invocation is a very personal one. I have been priestess to three other Daedric Princes, but Azura values the quality of her worshipers and the truth behind our adoration of her. When I was a Dark Elven maid of sixteen, I joined my grandmother's coven, worshipers of Molag Bal, the Schemer Princess. Blackmail, extortion, and bribery are as much the weapons of the Witches of Molag Bal as is dark magic. The Invocation of Molag Bal is held on the 20th of Evening Star, except during stormy weather. This ceremony is seldom missed, but Molag Bal often appears to her cultists in mortal guise on other dates. When my grandmother died in an attempt to poison the heir of Firewatch, I re-examined my faith in the cult.\n"
"\n"
"My brother was a warlock of the cult of Boethiah, and from what he told me, the Dark Warrior was closer to my spirit than the treacherous Molag Bal. Boethiah is a Warrior Princess who acts more overtly than any other Daedroth. After years of skulking and scheming, it felt good to perform acts for a mistress which had direct, immediate consequences. Besides, I liked it that Boethiah was a Daedra of the Dark Elves. Our cult would summon her on the day we called the Gauntlet, the 2nd of Sun's Dusk. Bloody competitions would be held in her honor, and the duels and battles would continue until nine cultists were killed at the hands of other cultists. Boethiah cared little for her cultists. She only cared for our blood. I do think I saw her smile when I accidentally slew my brother in a sparring session. My horror, I think, greatly pleased her.\n"
"\n"
"I left the cult soon after that. Boethiah was too impersonal for me, too cold. I wanted a mistress of greater depth. For the next eighteen years of my life, I worshiped no one. Instead I read and researched. In an old and profane tome, I came upon the name of Nocturnal: Nocturnal the Night Mistress, Nocturnal the Unfathomable. As the book prescribed, I called to her on her holy day, the 3rd of Hearth Fire. At last, I had found the personal mistress I had so long desired. I strove to understand her labyrinthine philosophy, the source of her mysterious pain. Everything about her was dark and shrouded, even the way she spoke and the acts she required of me. It took years for me to understand the simple fact that I could never understand Nocturnal. Her mystery was as essential to her as savagery was to Boethiah or treachery was to Molag Bal. To understand Nocturnal is to negate her, to pull back the curtains cloaking her realm of darkness. As much as I loved her, I recognized the futility of unraveling her enigmas. I turned instead to her sister, Azura.\n"
"\n"
"Azura is the only Daedra Princess I have ever worshiped who seems to care about her followers. Molag Bal wanted my mind, Boethiah wanted my arms, and Nocturnal perhaps my curiosity. Azura wants all of that, and our love above all. Not our abject slavering, but our honest and genuine caring in all its forms. It is important to her that our emotions be engaged in her worship. And our love must also be directed inward. If we love her and hate ourselves, she feels our pain. I will, for all time, have no other mistress."

" 300년 동안 나는 장미의 어머니이고 밤하늘의 여왕인, 달그림자의 데이드릭 군주, 아주라의 여사제였다. 우리는 그녀의 위대함에 대해 가치있고 아름다운것을 공물로 올리는 것 뿐 아니라 그녀의 인도를 위해 그녀를 소환하는, 3월 (First Seed) 21일, 호기즘 (Hogithum)의 날을 기념한다. 그녀는 잔인하지만 현명한 여신이다. 우리는 폭풍우가 몰아치는 날의 호기즘에는 그녀를 불러내지 않는다, 왜냐하면 비록 날짜는 일치하지 않지만, 그러한 날의 밤은 광기의 쉐오고라스에게 속해있기 때문이다.\n"
"\n"
"아주라에 대한 숭배는 아주 개인적인 이유에서다. 나는 또 다른 세 데이드릭 군주의 여사제이기도 했지만, 아주라는 그녀의 숭배자의 자질과 그녀에 대한 우리의 숭배뒤에 감춰진 진실을 가치있게 여긴다. 내가 16세의 다크 엘프 처녀였을때, 나는 권모술수의 군주, 몰락 발의 숭배자들의 모임인, 나의 할머니의 집회에 참여했다. 협박, 착취, 뇌물수수는 몰락 발의 마녀들의 무기만큼이나 사악한 마법이다. 몰락 발에 대한 기도는 폭풍우의 날씨인 날은 제외하고, 12월 (Evening Star) 20일에 열린다. 이 의식을 그냥 지나치는 경우는 좀처럼 없지만, 몰락 발은 종종 다른 날짜에 필멸자의 모습으로 그녀의 광신자들 앞에 나타난다. 나의 할머니가 파이어와치 (Firewatch)의 상속자를 독살하려다가 죽게 되었을때, 나는 나의 신앙을 재검토하게 되었다.\n"
"\n"
"나의 형제는 그가 나에게 한 말에 의하면 보에시아 종교 집단의 마법사였다, 그 어둠의 전사는 신뢰할수 없는 몰락 발보다 나에게 정신적으로 더 가깝게 느껴졌다. 보에시아는 명백하게 다른 어떤 데이드라보다 더 활동적인 전사의 여군주이다. 조용히 몰래 신앙의 전향을 획책하던 몇년후에, 직접적이고 즉각적인 결과를 가져다주는 여주인을 위해 신앙을 수행하는 것이 좋겠다고 느껶다. 게다가, 나는 보에시아가 다크 엘프의 데이드라인 점도 좋았다. 우리 종교집단은 우리가 건틀렛 (Gauntlet)이라 부르는, 11월 (Sun's Dusk) 2일날 그녀를 소환했다. 그녀를 기념하기 위한 피비린내나는 대회가 열리고, 9명의 광신도들이 다른 광신도들의 손에 의해 죽을때까지 결투와 전투가 계속되곤 했다. 보에시아는 자신의 광신도들에게는 별로 관심이 없고, 오직 우리의 피에만 관심을 가졌다. 내가 대결을 하다가 뜻하지 않게 나의 형제를 죽이게 되었을때 나는 그녀의 미소를 보았던것 같다. 내 생각에, 나의 끔찍함이 그녀를 아주 기쁘게 한 것 같다.\n"
"\n"
"그 후에 곧 나는 그 종교를 떠났다. 나에게 있어, 보에시아는 너무 비인격적이고 냉정했다. 나는 더욱 깊이가 있는 주인을 원했다. 내 삶의 다음 18년간, 나는 아무도 숭배하지 않았다. 대신에 나는 공부하며 연구하였다. 내가 밤의 지배자이자, 헤아릴수 없는 녹터널이라는 이름을 알게된 것은, 오래된 신성모독 서적이었다. 책에서 규정한대로, 나는 그녀의 성스러운 날인, 9월 (Hearth Fire) 3일에 그녀를 불러냈다. 마침내 나는 그토록 오랫동안 열망해왔던 나의 여주인을 찾아냈다. 나는 그녀의 불가사의한 고통의 근원인, 미로와 같이 복잡한 그녀의 철학을 이해하기 위해 매진했다. 그녀에 대한 모든것은, 심지어 내가 그녀를 위해 해야할 일을 말해주고 전해주는 방법조차, 비밀스럽고 베일에 싸여 있었다. 나는 결코 녹터널을 이해할수 없을 것이라는 간단한 사실을 알아내는데 몇 년을 소비하게 되었다. 잔혹함이 보에시아의, 배반이 몰락 발의 본질인것과 같이 그녀의 불가사의함은 그녀에 대한 본질이었다. 녹터널을 이해한다는 것은 그녀의 어둠의 왕국을 감추고 있는 커튼을 없애버림으로써, 그녀의 존재를 부인하는 행위이고. 나는 그녀를 더욱 더 사랑할수록, 그녀의 수수께끼를 푼다는 것이 헛된 일이라는 것을 알게 되었다. 결국 나는 그녀의 사제가 되는 대신에, 아주라를 택했다.\n"
"\n"
"아주라는 내가 숭배했던 데이드라 여신들중 자신의 추종자들에게 관심을 가져주는 유일한 여신이다. 몰락 발은 나의 정신을 원했고, 보에시아는 나의 무력을 원했으며, 그리고 녹터널은 아마도 나의 호기심을 원했던것 같다. 아주라는 그 모든 것을, 그리고 무엇보다 우리의 사랑을 원한다. 우리의 비굴한 아첨이 아니라, 모든 면에서 우리의 정직하고 진실한 섦김을 원하는 것이다. 우리의 감정이 그녀에 대한 숭배로 가득차 있는 것을 그녀는 중요히 여긴다. 그리고 우리의 사랑은 마음속 깊은곳에 닿아 있어야만 한다. 만약 우리가 그녀를 사랑한다면, 우리가 우리 스스로를 증오할때, 그녀는 우리의 아픔을 느낀다. 나는 앞으로 영원히, 그녀 외의 다른 여주인을 섬기지 않을 것이다."

"Among the ancient ancestral spirits who accompanied Saint Veloth and the Chimer into the promised land of Morrowind, the four Daedra Lords, Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath, are known as the Four Corners of the House of Troubles. These Daedra Lords rebelled against the counsel and admonition of the Tribunal, causing great kinstrife and confusion among the clans and Great Houses.\n"
"\n"
"Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath are holy in that they serve the role of obstacles during the Testing. Through time they have sometimes become associated with local enemies, like the Nords, Akaviri, or Mountain Orcs.\n"
"\n"
"Malacath is the reanimated dung that was Trinimac. Malacath is a weak but vengeful god. The Dark Elves say he is Malak, the god-king of the Orcs. He tests the Dunmer for physical weakness.\n"
"\n"
"Molag Bal is, in Morrowind, the Lord of Brutality. He tries to upset the bloodlines of Great Houses and otherwise ruins the Dunmer gene pool. A race of monsters, said to live in Molag Amur, are the result of his seduction of Vivec during the previous era.\n"
"\n"
"Sheogorath is the King of Madness. He always tests the Dunmer for mental weakness. In many legends, he is called upon by one Dunmer faction against another. In half of these stories, he does not betray those who called him, further confusing the issue of his place in the scheme of things. (\"Can he help us? Is he not an obstacle?\") He is often associated with the fear other races have of the Dunmer, especially those who, like the Empire, might prove as useful allies.\n"
"\n"
"Mehrunes Dagon is the god of destruction. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. To some, he represents the inhospitable land of Morrowind. He tests the Dunmer will to survive and persevere.\n"
"\n"
"The worship of these four malevolent spirits is against the law and practice of the Temple. However, the Four Corners seldom fail to discover those greedy, reckless, or mad enough to serve them. By ancient Temple law and custom, and also by Imperial law, the lives of witches and warlocks are forfeit. Imperial garrisons join Ordinators and Buoyant Armigers of the Temple in tracking down and destroying these foul covens in the wilderness refuges and ancient ruins where they conceal their profane worship."

"성자 벨로스와 카이머를 모로윈드의 약속된 땅으로 이끈 고대 조상의 영혼들 중 네 명의 데이드라 군주인 말라카스, 메이룬스 데이건, 몰라그 발, 그리고 쉐오고라스가 문제의 집을 구성하는 네 기둥으로 알려져 있다. 이 데이드라 군주들은 트리뷰날의 조언과 경고에 저항하고 집단과 위대한 가문 사이의 갈등과 혼란을 야기했다.\n"

"말라카스, 메이룬스 데이건, 몰라그 발, 그리고 쉐오고라스는 시험 도중에 장애물의 역할을 한다는 점에서 신성시된다. 세월 동안 그들은 가끔 노드, 아카비리나 산악지역의 오크들과 같은 지역적 적들과 연관지어졌다.\n"
"\n"
"말라카스는 트리니막의 잔재에서 다시 태어났다. 말라카스는 약하지만 복수심이 많은 신이다. 다크 엘프들은 그가 오크들의 신왕, 말락이라고 한다. 그는 던머들의 신체적 약함을 시험한다.\n"
"\n"
"몰라그 발은 모로윈드에서 잔혹함의 제왕으로 알려져 있다. 그는 가문의 혈통을 뒤틀어 버리거나, 그 외에도 던머 유전자를 망치려 한다. 몰라그 아무르에 산다는 괴물의 종족은 전 시대에, 비벡을 향한 그의 구애의 결과물들이라고 한다.\n"
"\n"
"쉐오고라스는 광기의 왕이다. 그는 항상 던머의 정신적 약함을 시험한다. 많은 전설속에서 그는 서로 다른 던머 파벌에 의해 달리 불린다. 이 전설들의 대부분에서는 그는 그를 부른 사람을 배신하지 않고, 나아가 이 체계속에서 자신의 위치에 대한 사안을 혼동시킨다고 한다. (그가 우리를 도울 수 있나? 그가 문제가 되는 것은 아닌가?) 그는 가끔 다른 종족들, 특히 제국처럼 유용한 동료가 될 수 있는 종족들의 던머에 대한 공포와 관련이 있다.\n"
"\n"
"메이룬스 데이건은 파괴의 신이다. 그는 화재, 지진과 홍수와 같은 자연 재해와 관련이 있다. 누군가에게 그는 모로윈드의 살 수 없는 땅을 나타내는 것이다. 그는 생존과 인내에 대한 던머의 의지를 시험한다.\n"
"\n"
"이 네 악신에 대한 숭배는 사원의 법과 관습을 어기는 것이다. 그러나 네 신들은 그들을 섬길 만큼 충분한 던머들의 탐욕, 무모함이나 광기를 쉽게 찾을 수 있었다. 고대 사윈의 법과 관습에 의해, 그리고 또한 제국의 법에 의해 사악한 마법사들은 처형을 당했고, 제국 수비대는 야외 도피처에서의 이 잘못된 집회들과 불경한 숭배를 행했던 고대 유적을 추적하고 파괴하기 위해 사원의 집행부와 용감한 기사단에 참여하곤 했다."

"For over a thousand years, the Priests of Vaermina have been masters of the art of alchemy. The complexity and potency of their mixtures are nothing short of legendary. These alchemical treasures are so highly sought after that a single draught showing up on the black market can command sums in the tens of thousands.\n"
"\n"
"Of the numerous potions that have surfaced to date, Vaermina's Torpor is perhaps the most impressive. A single sip of this viscous liquid places the imbiber in a state known as \"The Dreamstride.\" This condition allows the subject to experience the dreams of another as if he is actually there. The subject becomes an integral part of the dream. To any other entities in this dream state, the subject will be mistaken for the dreamer. The subject will even find his mannerisms, speech patterns, and knowledge expanded appropriately.\n"
"\n"
"To an observer, after the subject has imbibed the potion, he will appear to vanish. As the subject traverses distances within the dream, he will also traverse distances in the actual world. When the Torpor's effect has expired, the subject will fade back into reality in the exact location projected within the Dreamstride. Some Dreamstrides have transported their subjects a few feet, and some have appeared thousands of miles from their origin in a matter of minutes.\n"
"\n"
"It's worth noting that the Dreamstride is highly dangerous and presents the subject with numerous pitfalls. In certain dreams, subjects have been exposed to life-threatening scenarios such as sicknesses, violence, and even death. In most cases, the subject simply fades back to our world without harm, but in some instances, the subject never reappears and is assumed to have expired. In other instances, the subject reappears deceased. It's also quite possible that the subject could reappear in a precarious or hazardous location in reality, even when that location appeared safe within the Dreamstride.\n"
"\n"
"Vaermina's Torpor is as mysterious and elusive as the priests who created it. It's unknown whether this unique transport mechanism is a result of the Torpor itself or simply the odd machinations of Vaermina, but the potential for using the Dreamstride to penetrate seemingly impassible obstacles certainly outweighs its mysterious nature."

" 수천 년 넘게, 베르미나의 사제들은 연금술 기교의 자질을 따져볼 때 항상 최고를 차지해 왔다. 이들이 만들어내는 조합들이 가진 복잡함과 가능성은 전설이 되기에 전혀 부족함이 없었던 것이다. 이 연금의 보물은 너무나도 많은 이들이 찾고 있는 나머지, 단 한개의 포션이 암시장에 나타나자, 만 셉팀이 넘는 가격이 붙여지기도 했다.\n"

"그 동안 등장했던 수 많은 포션들 중에서, 베르미나의 몽환약이란 것은 그 중에서도 가장 인상적인 것이다. 이 강력한 액체의 단 한방울이라도 스며들게 되면 바로 \"꿈의 산책\" 이라는 상태에 빠지게 되는데 이 상태는 대상으로 하여금 마치 다른 이의 꿈에 직접 들어가 있는 것 같은 체험을 하게 해준다. 사용자는 그 꿈에서 한 부분을 차지하게 되는데, 꿈의 이야기가 진행되는 대로 행동하게 된다. 또한 꿈 속에서 사용자와 그 꿈의 대상은 같은 사람으로 인식된다. 사용자는 꿈의 대상이 된 자의 버릇, 말하는 법, 지식등을 적절히 배울 수 있게 되기도 한다.\n"
"\n"
"주변에서 포션을 마신 대상을 보는 사람들은 사용자가 갑자기 사라져버린 것을 보게 된다. 사용자가 꿈 속을 여행하는 동안, 그들은 현실에서도 여행하는 중인 것이다. 포션의 효과가 끝나게 되면, 대상은 현실로 돌아오는데 바로 자신이 꿈에서 존재하던 곳에 위치하게 된다. 어떤 이는 불과 몇발자국 떨어진 곳으로 이동하지만. 어떤 이는 몇 분 만에 수천 마일이나 떨어진 곳에 나타나기도 한다.\n"
"\n"
"이 \"꿈의 산책\"은 상당히 위험하고 사용자를 몇가지 위험에 처하게 한다. 어떤 꿈에서는, 대상이 질병, 폭력 혹은 심지어 죽음 같은 목숨이 위험한 상황에 처하곤 한다. 대부분의 경우 사용자는 그저 아무런 위험없이 다시 현실로 돌아오지만, 간혹, 효과가 끝났음에도 사용자가 다시 나타나지 않거나 죽은 채로 나타나기도 한다. 또한 꿈의 산책 상태에서는 매우 안전해 보였던 장소였을지라도 현실에서는 매우 불안정하거나 위험한 장소에 다시 나타나게 될 가능성도 있다.\n"

"베르미나의 몽환약은 그것을 만드는 사제들만큼이나 신비하고 찾기 어렵다. 이 특이한 이동 방식이 몽환약 자체의 효과인지, 단지 베르미나의 기묘한 처사인지 확실하지 않다. 하지만 꿈의 산책 도중 막혀 있는 장애물을 통과하는 능력은 확실히 그 신비한 성질에 의한 것이다."

"Some of our Bosmeri and Khajiiti students have come under a misapprehension, repeating the canard that not all the Altmer of Summerset are united behind our glorious Queen Ayrenn. Nothing could be further from the truth! We High Elves have a penchant for witticisms and wordplay that can sometimes be misinterpreted by those newly-exposed to our ancient and refined culture. To set the matter straight I've assembled this brief introduction to our beloved Queen of Alinor, intending to tell her story in a simple, direct fashion that can be understood even by our new allies in the Aldmeri Dominion.\n"

"The Altmer, of course, are descended in an unbroken line from the Divines who created Nirn, and none more so than the royal family of Alinor. Ayrenn's father, King Hidellith of august memory, ruled the Summerset Isles long and well, and exemplified the best traditions of Elven Ceremoniarchy, basing his every decision on the precedents laid down in the Scrolls of Praxis. \n"
"\n"
"In due time, as ordained by the Scrolls, King Hidellith and his wife Kinlady Tuinden conceived a child, who was named Ayrenn as the Praxis dictated. Princess Ayrenn was born on the 5th of Second Seed in the year 555 of the Second Era—a very auspicious date, though I will spare you the reasons why, as you lack the context to comprehend its full significance. However, you can believe me when I tell you all Summerset, Auridon, and Artaeum celebrated her birth for fifty-five days. \n"
"\n"
"It was foretold that Princess Ayrenn would reflect the restless and turbulent times in which she was born, and so it came to pass. Nimble and quick-witted, she was quick to master the lessons of her tutors, and from an early age often adopted unorthodox approaches to schoolwork. In fact, she sometimes became so engrossed in her independent studies that her whereabouts were unknown for days at a time. She would often return from these field trips with unusual knowledge and display remarkable new skills.\n"
"\n"
"One day in Evening Star of the year 573 the entire royal family of Alinor gathered at the Crystal Tower to celebrate Ayrenn's matriculation to the Sapiarchs' Labyrinth, where she was to study Altmeri Regal Praxis and Ceremoniarchy for the requisite 3,555 days. But Ayrenn didn't arrive—somewhere between the Palace and Tower the princess disappeared, and despite a 17th Degree Inquiry by the Justiciars, she was nowhere to be found. The Sapiarchs, however, reported that the night of her disappearance was filled with signs and portents: the constellation of the Lady seeming to ride the constellation of the Steed, the Great Orrery spun backward, and a young eaglet was found atop the statue of Topal the Explorer.\n"
"\n"
"In due course Prince Naemon, Ayrenn's eldest brother, was named heir to the throne of Alinor, and in 575 he matriculated into the Labyrinth. Naemon, like his father, was a natural ceremoniarch, who seemed to have a genuine relish for the rites and duties ordained by tradition for the heir. Indeed, when King Hidellith ascended to Aetherius in the year 580, Prince Naemon immediately began preparing to speak the eighty-eight day Coronation Liturgy that would elevate him to the throne in his father's place.\n"
"\n"
"Then, on a day unheralded, the unforeseen occurred! Word came from Port Velyn on the continent that Princess Ayrenn was on her way to Auridon by swan ship! In wonder and haste, the Court of Alinor took itself to Firsthold to greet her, arriving just in time to welcome her unexpected return. Princess Ayrenn announced that she was prepared, as the eldest heir, to assume the Throne of Alinor—and the High Justiciar affirmed that such was, indeed, her right. She was crowned Queen Ayrenn on the 7th of Frost Fall in the year 580.\n"
"\n"
"Now, some of you may have heard wild tales about Princess Ayrenn's adventures during her time away from Summerset—that she sailed as first mate with a pirate captain from Anvil, disguised herself as a Dunmer in order to read the Indigo Tomes in the vaults of Necrom, bested the Dervishes of Rihad at their own sword-dance, and even outdrank Queen Mabjaarn Flame-Hair of Windhelm in a mead-slamming contest. All myths and tales, I assure you, preposterous and deeply absurd. Our queen was merely away, preparing for Praxis and Ceremoniarchy in her own fashion of independent study. \n"
"\n"
"Since assuming the throne she has brought some innovations to the rule of our land—but this is as foretold at the time of her auspicious birth, and the Sapiarchs, one and all, have endorsed her modernizations. So you see, students, Ayrenn is undisputed Queen of these Isles, and all is right and proper—as it should be."

"\n"
"보스메리와 카짓 학생 중 일부는 서머셋의 모든 알트머가 우리의 영광스러운 아이렌 여왕님 아래에 단결되어 있지 않다는 오해섞인 주장을 되풀이하고 있습니다. 그건 완전히 헛소문입니다! 우리 하이 엘프들은 오래되었고 교양 있는 문화를 새로 접하는 사람들이 잘못 이해할 가능성이 있는 농담과 말장난을 선호하는 경향이 있지요. 이 문제를 바로잡기 위해 알드메리 자치령의 새로운 동맹자가 쉽고 빠르게 이해할 수 있도록 우리가 사랑하는 알리노어의 여왕님에 대한 간략한 소개를 준비했습니다.\n"
"\n"
"알트머가 넌을 창조한 디바인들의 후손이라는 것은 분명하지만, 알리노어 왕실 가문만큼 그 혈통에 가까운 사람들은 없습니다. 아이렌님의 부친이자 존엄하셨던 히델리스 왕께서는 서머셋 군도를 오랜 기간 잘 다스리셨습니다. 그분은 엘프의 의식제를 예시로 참고하여, 프랙시스 두루마리에 기록된 판례를 기반으로 결단을 내렸습니다. \n"
"\n"
"머지 않아 두루마리에 기록된 대로 히델리스 폐하와 왕비께서는 자식을 보게 되시었고, 프랙시스가 지시한 대로 아이의 이름을 아이렌이라고 지었습니다. 아이렌 공주님은 제2시대 555년 두 번째 파종 달 5일에 태어났습니다. 그날은 매우 길한 날이었습니다. 왜 길한 날인지 이야기하고 싶지만 배경 지식이 부족할 테니 넘어가도록 하겠습니다. 그냥 서머셋, 아우리돈, 아르테움의 모든 주민들이 55일간 공주님의 탄생을 축하했다는 것만 알아 두기를 바랍니다.\n"
"\n"
"아이렌 공주님께서 자신이 태어난 당시의 격동과 혼란의 시기와 같은 존재가 될 거라는 예언은 그대로 실행되었습니다. 민첩하고 머리가 좋으셨던 공주님은 지도 교사의 교육을 쉽게 완수하고 어릴 때부터 학업을 남다른 방식으로 터득했습니다. 또한, 자신만의 공부에 몰두해서 며칠 동안이나 어딘가로 사라져 버리는 일도 있었습니다. 그렇게 현장학습을 나갔다 비범한 지식을 배우고 돌아와서 새로 배운 놀라운 기술을 선보이기도 했습니다.\n"
"\n"
"573년 저녁별의 달 어느 날, 아이렌 공주님께 3,555일간 알트머의 왕정 프랙시스와 의식제에 대해 배우는 사피악의 미궁 입학 허가가 나온 것을 축하하기 위하여 모든 알리노어 왕족이 수정탑에 모였습니다. 하지만 아이렌님은 나타나지 않았습니다. 공주님은 궁전과 탑 사이 어딘가에서 자취를 감추셨으며 사법관들이 진행한 17단계의 수사에도 불구하고 찾아내지 못했습니다. 하지만 사피악의 미궁에서는 그분이 사라지셨던 밤은 징후와 징조로 가득 차 있었다고 보고했습니다. 숙녀자리가 준마자리를 타고 있는 듯이 보였으며 천구의는 반대로 돌고, 탐험가 토팔의 동상 위에 어린 새끼 독수리가 올라타 있는 것이 목격되었지요.\n"
"\n"
"이후 아이렌님의 동생 중 가장 나이가 많았던 네이몬 왕자님이 알리노어 왕족의 후계자로 지목되어 575년에 미궁에 입학하셨습니다. 네이몬님은 자신의 부친처럼 타고난 의식제 지지자였고, 후계자의 전통에 의해 정해진 의식과 의무를 진정으로 즐기는 것처럼 보였죠. 히델리스 폐하께서 580년에 승하하시자 네이몬 왕자님은 부친의 뒤를 이어 88일 동안 이어지는 대관식 준비를 서두르기 시작했습니다.\n"
"\n"
"그러나 아무 징조도 없이 뜻밖의 일이 일어났습니다! 아이렌 공주님이 백조 배를 타고 아우리돈으로 오는 중이라는 소식이 대륙의 벨린 항구에서 전해진 거죠! 놀란 알리노어 궁전에서는 서둘러 공주님의 예상치 못한 귀환을 환영하기 위해 겨우 시간에 맞추어 퍼스트홀드로 마중을 나갔습니다. 아이렌 공주님은 최연장자로서 알리노어의 왕위에 오를 준비가 되었다는 것을 밝히셨고, 고위 사법관은 공주님의 말이 옳다는 것에 동의하였습니다. 그분께선 580년 서리내림 달 7일에 아이렌 여왕으로 즉위하셨습니다.\n"
"\n"
"이제, 여러분들 중 몇몇은 아이렌 공주님이 서머셋을 떠나 있는 동안 겪은 모험담에 대해 들어 본 적이 있을 겁니다. 일등 항해사가 되어 앤빌의 해적 선장과 함께 항해했다거나, 네크롬의 보물 창고에서 인디고의 책을 읽으려고 던머로 변장했다거나, 리하드의 수도승을 칼춤으로 제압했다거나, 윈드헬름의 벌꿀술 마시기 대회에서 화염머리 마브잔 여왕보다 더 많이 마셨다거나 하는 것들 말이죠. 장담하건대, 모든 소문이나 이야기는 헛소문이며 매우 황당한 소리입니다. 우리의 여왕님께선 그저 그분만의 특별한 방식으로 프랙시스와 의식제를 준비하고 있었던 것 뿐입니다.\n"
"\n"
"왕위를 계승한 후 여왕님은 이 땅의 통치 방식에 변화를 주었습니다. 하지만 그것은 그분의 길한 탄생 당시에 예언된 일이었고, 사피악들과 다른 모두들이 여왕님의의 현대화를 지지하였습니다. 그러므로 학생 여러분들, 아이렌님께서 이 군도의 여왕이라는 사실은 변론의 여지가 없는 명백한 사실이랍니다."

"Wherein is related, O Happy Audience, the tale of His Majesty's thrice-blessed life, including an account of His Majesty's rise to the Throne of Sentinel, which tale is exemplary, and mention of some of His Majesty's excellences and virtues, which are numberless.\n"
"\n"
"Know, O Beloved Reader, that the lineage of our Auspicious King is both noble and royal, descending patrilinearly from Makala, from Ja-Fr, yea, even from High King Ar-Azal himself. Likewise matrilinearly his forebears are Grandees of Antiphyllos, including the meritorious Zizzeen of most august memory. Indeed, of the Grandee Zizzeen it was said by the Poet Behrouz that he was of such rectitude that, when he in error entered the Ladies' Bath-House, he forthwith put out both his eyes, lest he commit an indecency.\n"
"\n"
"(As to High King Ar-Azal, the Curious Delver has but to seek out the tome \"The Worthy Ar-Azal, His Deeds.\")\n"
"\n"
"Now when the All-Beneficent King Fahara'jad was but a Prince in Antiphyllos, on a day of days he did hunt birds in the Garden of the Grandees with his Ivory Bow, and by happenstance he saw a great Crow alight in a fig tree. And Prince Fahara'jad vowed, \"By Onsi's bright blade, I shall slay me this Crow!\" And he did nock an Ivory Arrow to the Ivory Bow and let fly, and lo, the Crow was taken in the eye and did die of the instant. \n"
"\n"
"Then dropped from the sky a hideous Hagraven, with a cursing of curses, and the she-daemon menaced the Young Prince with unclean talons, crying, \"You have slain the child of my bosom, and must die the death therefore! In sooth, I shall pluck out your eyes and partake of them like grapes!\" And screaming a great scream, she clawed at the Prince's orbs of vision. \n"
"\n"
"Then did a beam of golden light shine down from the heavens, and striding upon it as if upon a bright blade came down the Ever-Glorious Onsi, crying, \"Hold, Creature of Evil.\" And he smote off the Hagraven's claws, which fell upon the ground like hail, and the she-daemon fell likewise and commenced to grovel unto the god and beg for mercy. And Onsi spake, saying, \"Pleas shall avail you not, shrill virago, for you have threatened the Fateful Prince, whom it is my special care to foster and protect. For this noble stripling is the Fahara'jad whom prophesy foretells shall lead our people in the Years of Peril, and so you must needs die.\" And he struck off her head. \n"
"\n"
"And the Prince, sore amazed, did cover both his eyes, and when he dared to look again, both god and she-daemon were gone. Thus the Prince did misdoubt his own eyes, and hurried to the Holy Temple where he related all that had occurred to the Priest of Onsi. And the Priest deemed his seeing a True Seeing. And this was the first of the Prophesies of Monarchy."

"매우 놀란 왕자는 두 눈을 가렸고, 다시 한 번 봤을 때 신도 해그레이븐도 사라져 있었다. 자신의 눈을 의심한 왕자는 서둘러 성당으로 가 Onsi의 사제에게 자신이 본 모든 것을 말했다. 사제는 그가 본 것이 모두 진실이라고 판단하였다. 이것이 첫 번째 왕실의 예언이었다."

You have heard of the tragic coming of the Knahaten Flu, how it took both my father and the entire royal family of Wayrest, leaving our kingdom leaderless in a time of chaos. You now know with what reluctance I was persuaded to assume the throne of Wayrest. You know of the Halo of Gold that outlined the Sun on the day of my coronation. That omen of approval by the Divines dispelled all my doubts and converted even my most envious rivals into heartfelt allies.\n"

It is fortunate for our peoples—indeed, for all the peoples of Tamriel—that the true flame of the Empire of Man still burns in the Daggerfall Covenant. These are terrible times, but our destiny lies before us as straight and true as the Reman roads: we must march on Cyrodiil, overthrow the false empress and all her brood, and restore the Empire of Tamriel.

"Chapter 6: Ranser's War—Wayrest Besieged\n"
"\n"
"Ever since my accession to the throne of Wayrest in that momentous year of 2E 563, the question of who should become my queen consort was ever on my—and my advisors'—minds. King Ranser of Shornhelm had a goodly daughter, Princess Rayelle, and her hand was offered to me by my brother of Shornhelm both early and often. Indeed, my mind was almost made up to accept the Princess of Shornhelm when, on a visit to Sentinel, my eyes first beheld the Princess Maraya, daughter of King Fahara'jad. From that moment, I swore that Wayrest would have no queen but Maraya. Of course, there was another unexpected benefit: as her dowry, she brought a trade agreement between our two states that resulted in great prosperity for all.\n"
"\n"
"King Ranser, alas, was wroth that I had not accepted the hand of his daughter, and he withdrew his ambassador from the court of Wayrest. Although Ranser was invited to my wedding to Maraya in the spring of 566, like the other kings of the Covenant, he stayed, seething, in Shornhelm.\n"
"\n"
"I should perhaps have paid more attention to Ranser's choler, but I was so taken with my new bride and trade issues around the Iliac Bay that mountainous Shornhelm seemed distant and irrelevant. That mistake almost cost me my throne.\n"
"\n"
"For over a year, Ranser had been quietly mustering his troops and emptying his treasury to hire mercenaries. In Last Seed of 2E 566, he led his army out of Shornhelm in a lightning strike to the south. Ranser had marched through Alcaire and Menevia almost before we were aware of his approach. The Shornhelm advance guard reached the gates of Wayrest while the local militias we had quickly mustered were still filing through them. This was a moment when history trembled upon a cusp: if the attacking Oldgate Lancers scattered our militia and took the gate, Wayrest could fall to her attackers within the hour.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, I was personally present at the gate, along with my Cumberland Guard. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, I had my bannerman sound the charge. I led the gate guards and my household troops out against the Oldgate Lancers. My men wore full armor, and I, though unarmored, bore at my side the mighty Orichalc Scalpel, an enchanted broadsword of many virtues. The Scalpel, drawn for the first time in anger, flashed and hummed like a blade in a sawmill as we hurled ourselves upon the Lancers. Our enemies, who suddenly found themselves opposed by armored veterans rather than panicky irregulars, were further confounded by the sudden onset of a thunderstorm. Lashed by hail, their horses terrified by lightning, faced with the Orichalc Scalpel scything through their necks and limbs, the vaunted Oldgate Lancers hesitated, then broke and ran, pell-mell, from the gate.\n"
"\n"
"By the time Ranser's main forces arrived on the scene, our troops were all within the walls. The gates were shut up tight, but the King of Shornhelm was undeterred. The city of Wayrest found itself once more under siege, and Ranser, with more craft and foresight than the Reachman Durcorach, had come with siege engines in his train."

"슬프게도 랜서 왕은 자신의 딸을 선택하지 않은 것에 분노해서 웨이레스트의 궁궐에 머물던 외교대사를 소환했다. 566년 봄, 나는 마라야와의 결혼식에 랜서 왕을 초청했으나, 그는 대거폴 동맹의 다른 왕들과 마찬가지로 숀헬름에 머물며 분을 삭일 뿐이었다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 랜서왕의 신경에 더 주의를 기울여야 했지만, 내 새로운 신부와 일리악 만을 두고 일어난 무역 문제 때문에 바빠서 산악 지대인 숀헬름은 너무 멀고 나와는 관계 없는 일이라고 여겼다. 이 같은 실수 때문에 왕좌를 잃어버릴 뻔 하였다.\n"
"\n"
"1년이 넘는 기간 동안, 랜서 왕은 조용히 병력을 모으고 재산을 털어서 용병을 소집했다. 2시대 566년의 마지막 파종 달에, 그는 남쪽에 번개가 치는 가운데 군대를 이끌고 숀헬름을 떠났다. 랜서 왕은 우리가 알아차릴 새도 없이 알케어와 메네비아를 지나쳤다. 숀헬름의 선발대가 웨이레스트의 성문에 다다를 무렵, 우리가 급히 소집한 지방 민병대가 성문 앞에 줄지어 서 있었다. 바로 이 사실 하나가 역사를 뒤바꾸었다. 올드게이트의 창기병이 우리 민병대를 공격하고 성문을 점거했다면, 웨이레스트는 1시간만에 점령당해 버렸을지도 모른다.\n"
"\n"
"다행스럽게도, 그 때 나는 컴벌랜드의 경비병과 함께 성문에 있었다. 상황의 중대성을 파악한 나는 기수에게 돌격 나팔을 불게 했다. 나는 성문 경비병과 근위대를 이끌고 올드게이트의 창기병과 맞서 싸웠다. 내 군사들은 완전무장을 했고, 나는 그렇지 않았으나 여러 이점을 가진 마법부여가 된 강력한 오리할콘 검을 차고 있었다. 분노에 가득 차서 오리할콘 검을 휘두른 것은 그 때가 처음이었으나, 창기병들에게 휘두를 때마다 제재소의 칼날처럼 빛을 내며 웅웅거렸다. 자신들이 상대하는 게 겁먹은 비정규군이 아니라 무장한 고참병이라는 것을 깨달은 우리의 적들은 갑자기 뇌우가 몰려오자 당황하기 시작했다. 우박에 맞은 적의 말은 번개를 두려워하며 당황하다 오리할콘 검에 목과 팔다리가 잘려나갔고, 이름높은 올드게이트의 창기병도 주저하다가 갑자기 허둥지둥 성문에서 달아나기 시작했다.\n"
"\n"
"랜서 왕의 주요 부대가 현장에 도착했을 때, 우리 병력은 이미 전부 벽 안에 있었다. 성문은 굳게 닫혀 있었지만, 숀헬름의 왕은 단념하지 않았다. 웨이레스트 도시는 다시 한 번 포위되었고, 리치맨 더코라치보다 더 만반의 준비를 해온 랜서 왕은 공성무기를 가져온 상태였다."

"Chapter 3: At the Gates of Daggerfall!\n"
"\n"
"For a dozen years after the Battle of Granden Tor, the kingdoms of High Rock were at peace, and the merchant ships of Wayrest, Daggerfall, and Sentinel traded near and far to all the ports of Tamriel. In my father's hall of business in Wayrest I learned of the tracking of shipments, the balancing of accounts, and the fluctuation of currencies, but Pierric of Cumberland knew the nature of the world, and he was not content to have his son learn only of the ways of peace and trade. Every morning I sparred with the Cumberland Master of Arms, and every afternoon the weather permitted I rode a warhorse, exercising with the Menevia Heavy Dragoons. It wasn't just practice: for two months every summer, I traveled as lieutenant of the mounted escort of the Evermore Caravan, and a half-dozen times we fought off hill bandits, Goblin raiders, and Reachman war bands.\n"
"\n"
"I was fortunate to have spent so much time with a hilt in my hand, for in 2E 541, when I was but twenty, Durcorach the Black Drake spread his wings in the Reach and mustered his feral tribesmen to war. Erupting from their mountain lairs like ants from a kicked anthill, the Reachmen howled down into Bangkorai, burning and looting. After only three days' siege, Evermore fell to this horde. The land was pillaged and its people massacred. Hallin's Stand held out longer, but eventually it was also overrun by the heathen swarm. Within days, they were across the Bjoulsae and bearing down upon Wayrest.\n"
"\n"
"Then all were grateful that King Gardner had built new walls and battlements around Wayrest, for the town had grown so that it had burst the bounds of the old walls. Throngs of people swarmed in from the countryside, and soon it seemed that all Menevia, Gavaudon, and Alcaire were within the city walls. But when the Reachman storm burst upon Wayrest, the crowded conditions seemed a small price to pay for protection from the fury of those Daedra-loving heathens.\n"
"\n"
"Thus began the epic Siege of Wayrest, when for fifty-seven days and nights the Bretons of Stormhaven manned the walls and repulsed the savage assaults of our terrible opponents. The Reachmen, lacking siege engines, were unable to breach our new walls and take the city by storm, and lacking ships they were unable to blockade our harbor and reduce the city by starvation. Stalemate: was Durcorach's invasion of High Rock at an end?\n"
"\n"
"Indeed, no: your Reachman warrior, though fearless and fierce, is not as a rule very patient. The Black Drake left enough troops in the revetments around our walls to keep us bottled up inside and simply marched off west into Glenumbra. Taken by surprise, the newly-independent city-state of Camlorn fell and was sacked. And then Durcorach turned his eyes south, toward Daggerfall.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, King Gardner heeded my advice to use our merchant ships as transports for the Heavy Dragoons. That was how I found myself at the head of the lances of Wayrest's finest as we charged into the rear of the Reachmen massed before Daggerfall's city gates. All Bretons know how the Black Drake's warriors were caught completely by surprise, how I smote Durcorach and tore down his Unholy Banner. They know of the sortie of the Knights of Daggerfall in which King Bergamot finished the work we'd begun, scattering the broken army of heathens like autumn leaves before a gale.\n"
"\n"
"Only one fortnight after that I watched, head bowed, as the kings of Daggerfall, Camlorn, Shornhelm, Evermore, and Wayrest signed the first Daggerfall Covenant."

"제3장: 대거폴의 문에서!\n"
"\n"
"그란덴 바위산의 전투가 있은 지 몇십 년 동안 하이 락의 왕국은 평화로웠고, 웨이레스트, 대거폴, 센티넬의 상선들은 탐리엘의 모든 항구에서 거래를 했다. 아버지께서 일하시는 웨이레스트에서 나는 선적물 추적과 회계의 균형 맞추기, 통화 변동에 대해서 배웠다. 하지만 컴벌랜드의 피에릭께선 세계의 본질을 알고 계셨고, 당신의 아들에게 단순히 평화와 장사 방법에 대해 배우게 하는 것만으로는 만족하지 않았다. 매일 아침마다 컴벌랜드의 전투 달인에게 훈련을 받았고,  낮에는 날씨가 허락하는 한 군마를 타고 메네비아의 중장 용기병과 운동을 했다. 그것은 단순한 훈련이 아니었다. 매년 여름 2개월 동안은 말을 타고 에버모어 행상단의 호위 대장으로서 일했고, 산적과 고블린 침입자들, 리치맨 전쟁부대와 여러 번 맞서 싸웠다.\n"
"\n"
"2시대 541년, 내가 20세가 되었을 때 검은 드레이크 더코라치가 리치로 세력을 넓히고 야만스러운 부족민을 전쟁에 소집했다. 무기를 들고 오랫동안 싸웠던 것은 나에게 행운이었다. 발로 차인 개미집에서 나온 개미처럼 산의 은신처에서 쏟아져 나온 리치맨들은 함성을 지르며 뱅코라이로 진입해 모든 걸 불태우며 약탈했다. 겨우 3일간의 포위 끝에, 에버모어는 적 병력에게 굴복했다. 토지는 약탈되고 사람들은 학살당했다. 할린의 저항은 오랫동안 저항했지만 결국 이교도 무리에게 점령되었다. 그들은 며칠만에 뵬사에를 건너 웨이레스트를 공격할 것처럼 보였다.\n"
"\n"
"그 때의 모든 사람들은 가드너 왕이 웨이레스트에 새로운 벽과 흉벽을 세운 것을 감사히 여겼다. 마을의 규모가 넓어져서 오래된 성벽이 무너졌기 때문이었다. 지방에서 많은 사람들이 몰려왔고, 거리의 벽 안쪽은 마치 메네비아, 가바우돈, 그리고 알케어가 전부 있는 것처럼 보였다. 하지만 리치맨들이 웨이레스트로 몰려오자 그 혼잡함은 데이드라를 숭배하는 이교도들의 분노로부터 보호받기 위해 치뤄야 할 작은 대가처럼 보였다.\n"
"\n"
"이렇게 해서 장대한 웨이레스트 포위가 시작되었다. 스톰헤이븐의 브레튼은 57일간 밤낮으로 무시무시한 적의 야만적 공격으로부터 벽을 지켰다. 공성무기가 부족한 리치맨은 새로운 벽을 무너뜨리지 못했고, 도시를 함락하지도 못했다. 또한 배가 부족해서 항구를 봉쇄하는 방법으로 도시의 인구를 굶겨 죽이지도 못했다. 완전한 교착 상태였다. 그렇다면 더코라치의 하이 락 침공은 끝났을까?\n"
"\n"
"아니, 그렇지 않았다. 두려움 없고 흉포한 리치맨 전사는 참을성이 없었다. 검은 드레이크는 성벽 주변에 있는 호안에 충분한 병력을 남겨 우리를 가두어 놓고 서쪽의 글렌움브라로 이동했다. 새롭게 독립했던 도시 국가 캠론은 기습을 받아 함락되고 약탈당했다. 더코라치는 남쪽의 대거폴로 시선을 향했다. \n"
"\n"
"다행스럽게도, 가드너 왕은 우리의 상선으로 중장 용기병을 수송한다는 나의 제안을 받아들였다. 그 일을 계기로 나는 웨이레스트 최고의 창기병을 이끌고 대거폴의 정문 앞에 서 있던 리치맨 무리 뒤쪽으로 돌입했다. 브레튼이라면 누구나 검은 드레이크의 전사들이 얼마나 완벽하게 기습당했는지, 내가 어떻게 더코라치를 공격해 놈의 불경한 깃발을 끌어내렸는지 알고 있다. 벨가못 왕의 대거폴 기사가 우리가 시작한 일을 끝내고 강풍 앞의 낙엽처럼 피해를 입은 이교도 군세를 흩어버린 것을 알고 있는 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"그리고 2주일 뒤 나는 대거폴, 캠론, 숀헬름, 에버모어, 웨이레스트의 왕들이 최초의 대거폴 동맹에 서명하는 것을 머리를 숙이고 보게 되었다. "

"By Helgreir Lute-Voice, Bard of Windhelm\n"
"\n"
"Born in 2E 546 to Queen Mabjaarn Flame-Hair, Prince Jorunn grew up knowing that his elder sister, Nurnhilde, was fated to take the throne. A singer of rare talent in a culture that reveres the power of the human voice, Jorunn studied at Skald's Retreat on the Isle of Gold outside Riften. There he learned all that could be taught by the most renowned bards of the Eastern Kingdom. He was dubbed the \"Skald-Prince\" of Skyrim.\n"
"\n"
"Jorunn spent most of his youth in artistic and philosophical pursuits, cultivating a broad array of artists, artisans, and performers throughout Eastern Skyrim and beyond. He spent time in Mournhold, Stormhold, Sutch, Elinhir, and is even reputed to have visited Solitude, the capital of Western Skyrim, in disguise. Though he claimed to have no interest in politics or the business of rule, his natural leadership qualities made him the unofficial leader of the creative community wherever he found himself. Though he received little formal schooling in the arts of arms and warfare—as little as a prince of the Nords could manage, anyway—traveling across Tamriel was always a dangerous activity. His travels taught him less orthodox ways of dealing with trouble.\n"
"\n"
"Jorunn was in Riften when the Akaviri of Dir-Kamal assaulted the northeast coast of Skyrim in 2E 572. Jorunn and his closest comrades, the \"Pack of Bards,\" fought their way up the coast to Windhelm, arriving just in time to see its gates breached by the Akaviri. Jorunn hurled himself into the fray, street-fighting being something he had experience with, but was unable to prevent the fall of the city and the slaying of Queen Mabjaarn and Nurnhilde, the \"Brief Queen,\" who both went down fighting.\n"
"\n"
"Wounded and devastated, Jorunn barely escaped the sack of Windhelm alive. Feeling for the first time the responsibility of his royal birth, he decided to appeal to the Greybeards for aid, and so made his way, stealthily but quickly, to High Hrothgar. For reasons that have not been divulged, the Greybeards decided to teach the Skald-Prince a thu'um, one that summons a hero from Sovngarde to fight for the Tongue who uses it. But in Jorunn's voice the thu'um became a royal call of valor, and the summoned hero was none other than Wulfharth the Ash-King.\n"
"\n"
"Together Wulfharth and Jorunn, now claiming the title Skald-King, rallied the Nords of Eastern Skyrim, mustering an army from the Rift and the outer regions of Eastmarch, then fortifying Riften. Dir-Kamal, moving south from Windhelm, found Riften defended by angry Nords inspired by the presence of Wulfharth and eager to fight. So Dir-Kamal bypassed Riften and marched on Mournhold, the Akaviri leader assuming that the Nords would be glad to see him go.\n"
"\n"
"That choice was a fatal mistake. Jorunn and Wulfharth led their army in pursuit of the Akaviri force, and a Nord army entered Morrowind for the first time since the Battle of Red Mountain. The Akaviri army was caught at Stonefalls between the Nords and a Dunmer legion led by Almalexia, but the outcome of the great battle hung in the balance—until a surprise intervention from a phalanx of Argonian shellbacks, led by a trio of reptilian battlemages. The Akaviri line was broken and they were driven into the sea, where they drowned by the thousands.\n"
"\n"
"The Ash King, his purpose fulfilled, returned to Sovngarde. In Windhelm, three weeks later, Jorunn was crowned High King in the throne room of the Palace of Kings."

And ever did the shade of Al-Esh speak to him, serrated words that rasped his concept-organ and brought him to wisdom through affliction.\n"

"And he recorded her words in his simian gore with glyphs on the Beseeching Scarp, and the fire in his blood did etch the lithic face with the Seventy-Seven Inflexible Doctrines. And though the labor depleted, yea, even consumed his very substance, he stinted not, for he knew that death is an illusion. For did not Al-Esh persist, speaking knives, though dead? And had not Pelin-Al been witness to her death, although dead himself at the death of Umar-Il? Then did Marukh know a Right Reaching, that one devoted to Proper-Life and Ehlnofic Annulment shall persist beyond the illusion of death—for indeed, the drive to expunge corruption can conquer even the Arkayn Cycle."

"This history is recorded by Swyk the Long-Sighted, of the Circle of Jorrvaskr in the Second Era. While I am not gifted with a sharp gift of words, I have learned the stories of the Companions before me, and set to record them that they might not be lost when I am. Hereafter is the list of notable Harbingers of the Companions, those who lead us through the darkness to glories in Sovngarde.\n"
"\n"
"Notes on the Harbinger: the Companions have never had a true leader since Ysgramor—none have been mighty enough to corral the great hearts that beat within Jorrvaskr. While others like mages and thieves need the blessings of their hierarchy to know how to dress, we Companions are capable of leading our own destinies to glory. The Harbinger advises, resolves disputes, and helps to clarify when questions arise of the nature of honor. In the thousands of years the Companions have held at Jorrvaskr, there have been Harbingers both terrible and brilliant, those known for their arm, those for their hearts, and those for their minds. Here are listed some of the most gloried Harbingers, who inspire song and deed.\n"
"\n"
"Ysgramor: the first Harbinger, the first Man, the bringer of Words, and the one who first bound the Companions to honor in that far off land of long ago. Better people have written of him, so I will not attempt to meet their words.\n"
"\n"
"Jeek of the River: Captain of the Jorrvaskr during the Return, discoverer of the Skyforge, founder of Whiterun, and keeper of the original oath of the Companions, now lost to time. While other crews sought glory in conquest, his was the first to settle and serve as protector for the less war-gifted in the land as they came behind.\n"
"\n"
"Mryfwiil the Withdrawn: Several hundred years after the death of Ysgramor, the Companions as we now know them were soldiers for hire, little better than mercenaries. Our services could be purchased for the fighting of wars, but the commitment to individual honor meant that often Shield-Brothers would be forced to face each other on the field of battle. The bonds of honor which bind the Companions threatened to break, until Mryfwiil, in his wisdom, decreed that we would no longer be party to any war or political conflict of any kind. Because of his steady hand, the Companions today are known as impartial arbiters of honor, in addition to their glories on the field of battle.\n"
"\n"
"Cirroc the Lofty: The first Harbinger to not be of ancestral Atmoran blood. This was around the time that the Nords began to think of themselves as such, and there were great disputes about purity and the legacy of Ysgramor. Cirroc first came to Jorrvaskr as a servant, but the Redguard quickly proved his mettle when treated disrespectfully by one of the less honor-bound warriors of the time. Granted the stature of an honorary Companion after saving the life of Harbinger Tulvar the Unmentioned, he became known as the most capable of Shield-Brothers in the hall, with speed and cunning surpassing any of the old Atmoran stock. His time as Harbinger was short-lived, but it is said that his field knowledge of bladework continues to pass to every new Companion through their training.\n"
"\n"
"Henantier the Outsider: The first Elven Harbinger. Like Cirroc before him, he was initially subject to ridicule when arriving at Jorrvaskr, for this was the time (near the closing of the First Era) when Elves were not permitted to be full Companions, and few were even allowed to see the inside of the hall. Henantier was humble in the daylight hours, performing any task asked of him. At night, he trained fiercely in the outside yard, allowing himself only minutes of sleep before resuming his servant duties the next day. So he toiled through several Harbingers, never resting, never complaining, and always keeping his mind and body sharp. Given his long life, he came to be trusted by the new Companions as the one who helped them learn the ways of honor.\n"
"\n"
"When one such pupil had aged into an old man and become Harbinger himself, Henantier was the one at his deathbed. With all Companions assembled, he named Henantier as his successor, saying, \"Even an Elf can be born with the heart of a Nord sometimes.\" There were some number of Companions who laid down their weapons that day, but those who remained knew the truth of honor, and it is their legacy we continue to bear.\n"
"\n"
"Macke of the Piercing Eyes: A Harbinger known for her great beauty, but any who underestimated her on account of it would never make the mistake again. She was said to have once stared down half an opposing army, then slaughtered the remainder single-handedly. Her disappearance in her eighth year as Harbinger has never been explained, though many slanderous lies claim to make accountings for it.\n"
"\n"
"Kyrnil Long-Nose: After the dark periods of the Second Era, when a string of false and dishonorable Harbingers laid claim to Jorrvaskr, it was Kyrnil Long-Nose who gathered the true hearts of the Companions in the wilds and stormed Jorrvaskr itself, killing the usurpers and returning honor through blood, in the old ways. He began the tradition of trusted advisors called the Circle (after our great lord Ysgramor's council of captains) who would serve as examples to the younger, newer Companions.\n"
"\n"
"By ensuring that the notions of honor can have an unbroken string of tradition, he steadied the course of the Companions and restored our destinies to that of Ysgramor's, pressing ever onwards to Sovngarde."

"이 역사는 제 2 시대 요바스카 서클의 일원, 천리안 스와이크에 의한 기록이다. 나는 글에 재능이 있지는 않지만, 내 이전의 컴패니언에 대한 역사를 배웠고, 내 대에서 그것을 잃어버리지 않도록 기록하기 시작했다. 여기에는 어둠을 뚫고 우리를 소븐가드의 영광으로 이끌어준 유명한 컴패니언의 선도자 일람을 기록한다.\n"
"\n"
"선도자의 메모: 컴패니언에는 이스그래머 이래로 진정한 통솔자는 없다. 그 누구에게도 요바스카에 뛰고 있는 위대한 심장을 통솔할 수 있는 강인함은 없었다. 마법사나 도둑들은 계급에 따라 어떤 옷을 입는지도 바뀌어 왔으나, 우리들 컴패니언은 스스로 영광의 운명을 쥘 수 있다. 선도자는 조언을 하고 문제를 해결하며 명예에 관한 의문이 들면 그것을 해명한다. 컴패니언은 몇 천년 간 요바스카에 있었으며, 선도자 중에는 실력이나 마음, 그 영혼 면에서 비참했던 자도 있었고 뛰어났던 자도 있었다. 여기 노래나 행동에 영향을 끼친 가장 영광스러운 선도자들의 목록이 있다.\n"
"\n"
"이스그래머: 최초의 선도자, 최초의 인간, 언어를 전달한 자. 그리고 먼 옛날 멀리 떨어진 토지에서 처음으로 컴패니언에 영광을 가져온 자. 더 훌륭한 자가 그에 대해 기록한 것이 있기 때문에, 여기서는 기술하지 않는다.\n"
"\n"
"강의 직: 귀환 중이던 요바스카의 선장이자, 스카이포지의 발견자, 화이트런의 창설자, 시간과 함께 잃어버린 컴패니언 최초의 맹세의 수호자. 다른 선원들은 정복의 영광을 원하였으나, 그의 선원들은 최초로 정착하고 전쟁에 적합하지 않아 뒤늦게 도착한 자들의 호위를 맡았다.\n"
"\n"
"후퇴의 므라이프윌: 이스그래머 사망으로부터 수백년 후, 컴패니언은 용병보다는 조금 더 제대로 된 고용병사의 집단이 되었다. 전쟁에서 싸우기 위해서 고용되었으나 개인의 명예를 추구했기 때문에, 호위-형제들끼리도 어쩔 수 없이 전장에서 얼굴을 마주쳐야했다. 므라이프윌의 지혜로 어떠한 전쟁이나 정치적 싸움에도 관여하지 않도록 선언하게 되기전에는, 컴패니언의 명예의 끈이 붕괴하기 일보 직전이었다. 그의 뛰어난 통솔력 덕분에, 오늘날의 컴패니언은 공평한 조정자로서 전장에서의 영광과 함께 유명해졌다.\n"
"\n"
"고귀한 시록: 아트모라 인이 아닌 선도자들 중 최초이다. 이는 노드가 자신들을 스스로 노드라 여기기 시작하여 순수함과 이스그래머의 유산을 둘러싼 큰 싸움이 있었을 무렵이다. 시록은 처음에 종자로 요바스카에 왔지만, 이 레드가드는 당시 명예도 없는 전사들로부터 부당한 취급을 받았을 때 바로 자신의 용기를 증명했다. 당시 선도자였던 침묵의 툴바를 구한 뒤로 그는 명예로운 컴패니언의 지위를 얻었다. 호위-형제로서도 가장 유능한 전사로서도 알려져 있으며, 속도와 기교는 모든 아트모라 인들을 상회하였다. 그가 선도자로 있었던 시기는 짧았으나 그 검술은 새로운 컴패니언들에 대한 훈련을 통하여 이어지고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"아웃사이더 헤난티어: 최초의 엘프 선도자. 이전의 시록과 마찬가지로, 그도 요바스카에 왔을 당시에는 비웃음의 표적이었고, 시기적인 배경도 있어서 (제1 시대가 끝날 무렵이었다) 엘프는 정식 컴패니언이 되지 못하고 전당 안을 들여다보는 것조차 허락되지 않았다. 낮동안 헤난티어는 겸허하게 부탁받은 일이라면 무엇이든 했다. 밤에는 안뜰 밖에서 맹렬히 훈련하였고, 다음 날 일을 시작할 때까지 몇분밖에 자지 않았다. 그는 수명의 선도자를 섬기며 쉬지않고 불만도 없이, 몸과 마음을 계속해서 갈고 닦았다. 오랜 세월이 지나 그는 신입 컴패니언들에게 명예를 가르친 자로서 신용받게 되었다.\n"
"\n"
"제자 중 한명이 선도자가 되어 노인이 되었을 무렵 헤난티어는 임종을 맞이했다. 선도자는 모든 컴패니언들을 모아 그의 후계자로서 헤난티어를 가리키며 말하였다. \"때때로 엘프도 노드의 마음을 갖고 태어나는 경우가 있다.\" 그날 컴패니언에는 무기를 내려놓는 자도 있었으나, 진정한 명예를 아는 자들은 남았다. 우리들은 그들의 유산을 짊어지고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"매의 눈 맥케: 그 아름다움으로 유명한 선도자이나, 그 이유로 과소평가하는 자는 같은 잘못을 되풀이할 것이다. 적군의 절반을 노려보는 것만으로 쓰러트리고, 남은 자들을 단독으로 쓰러트렸다는 이야기가 전해지고 있다. 선도자로서 8년째 되던 해에 행방불명이 된 이유는 밝혀지지 않았으나, 그 이유에 관해 많은 음모론들이 있다.\n"
"\n"
"긴 코의 키르닐: 제2 시대의 암흑기 이후 연달아 불성실하고 불명예스러운 선도자가 요바스카에 대핸 권리를 주장하던 무렵, 진정한 마음을 가진 컴패니언을 황야에서 모아 요바스카에 맹공격을 퍼부었던 것이 긴 코의 키르닐이다. 전통적인 방식으로 강탈자를 물리치고 피를 흘려 명예를 되찾았다. 그는 젊고 새로운 컴패니언들의 규범을 나타내는, 서클이라 불리는 신뢰할만한 조언자 집단 (위대한 이스그래머 선장의 회의에서 이름을 붙였다)을 창설하였다.\n"
"\n"
"명예의 개념을 깨트리지 않는 전통으로서, 그는 컴패니언이 나아갈 길을 정했다. 우리들은 다시 한번 이스그래머를 본받아 소븐가드로 나아가게 되었다."

"During the early bloody years of the Second Era, Vanus Galerion was born under the name Trechtus, a serf on the estate of a minor nobleman named Lord Gyrnasse of Sollicich-on-Ker. Trechtus' father and mother were common laborers, but his father had secretly, against the law of Lord Gyrnasse, taught himself and Trechtus to read. Lord Gyrnasse had been advised that literate serfs were an abomination of nature and dangerous to themselves and their lords. All bookstalls within Sollicich-on-Ker had been closed. All booksellers, poets, and teachers were forbidden, except within Gyrnasse's keep. Nevertheless, a small scale smuggling operation kept a number of books and scrolls in circulation under Gyrnasse's shadow.\n"
"\n"
"When Trechtus was eight, the smugglers were found and imprisoned. Some said that Trechtus' mother, an ignorant and religious woman fearful of her husband, betrayed the smugglers, but there were other rumors as well. The trial of the smugglers was nonexistent, and the punishment swift. The body of Trechtus' father was kept hanging for weeks during the hottest summer Sollicich-on-Ker had seen in centuries.\n"
"\n"
"Three months later, Trechtus ran away from Lord Gyrnasse's estate. He made it as far as Alinor, half-way across Summerset Isle. A band of troubadours found him nearly dead, curled up in a ditch by the side of the road. They nursed him to health and employed him as an errand boy in return for food and shelter. One of the troubadours, a soothsayer named Heliand, began testing Trechtus' mind and found the boy, though shy, to be preternaturally intelligent and sophisticated, given his circumstances. Heliand recognized in the boy a commonality, for Heliand had been trained on the Isle of Artaeum as a mystic.\n"
"\n"
"When the troupe was performing in the village of Potansa on the far eastern end of Summerset, Heliand took Trechtus, then a boy of eleven, to the Isle of Artaeum. The Magister of the Isle, Iachesis, recognized potential in Trechtus and took him on as pupil, giving him the name of Vanus Galerion. Vanus trained his mind on the Isle of Artaeum, as well as his body.\n"
"\n"
"Thus was the first Archmagister of the Mages Guild trained. From the Psijics of the Isle of Artaeum, he received his training. From his childhood of want and injustice, he received his philosophy of sharing knowledge."

"2시대 초기의 피비린내나는 몇 년 동안에, 바누스 갈레리온 은 솔리키치-온-케르  영지의 주인인 하급 귀족, 기어나쎄 경의 농노로써, 트레치투스라는 이름으로 태어났다. 트레치투스의 아버지와 어머니는 평범한 노동자였지만, 그의 아버지는 기어나쎄 경의 법률을 거스르며, 비밀스레 혼자 공부를 하며 트레치투스에게 읽은 법을 가르쳤다. 기어나쎄경은 학식을 갖춘 농노들은 자연의 섭리를 파괴하며 그들의 주인에게 위험한 존재라는 조언을 들었기에, 솔리키치-온-케르 내의 모든 서점을 닫아버렸다. 또한 모든 서적 상인들과 시인, 선생들은 기어나쎄의 성안을 제외하고는 그의 영지로 출입이 금지되었다.\n"
"\n"
"트레치투스가 8살이 되었을때, 그의 아버지는 적발이 되었고 감옥에 갇히게 되었다. 어떤이는 남편을 두려워하는 무지하고 독실한 여성인 트레치투스의 어머니가 그를 배신한 것이라 말하지만, 그외 다른 여러 소문들중 하나일 뿐이었다. 그 밀수업자에 대한 재판은 열리지도 않았고, 형벌 또한 순식간에 이루어졌다. 트레치투스 아버지의 시체는 솔리키치-온-케르 역대 최고의 무더운 여름동안 몇주간이나 목메달려져 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"3개월후, 트레치투스는 기어나쎄경의 영지로부터 도망쳤다. 그는 서머셋 아일까지의 절반정도 거리인 앨리노어 까지 도망치는데 성공했다. 음유시인의 한 무리가 길 옆의 배수로에서 몸을 웅크린채 거의 죽기 직전인 그를 발견했다. 그들은 건강해지기까지 그를 간호해주었고, 먹을것과 주거를 제공하는 대신 그를 심부름꾼으로 일을 하게 했다. 음유시인 무리중 한명인, 헬리안드 라는 이름의 예언자가 트레치투스의 정신을 시험해보고는, 비록 겁은 많지만, 그 소년이 초자연적인 지능과, 그의 상황에 대비해볼때 뛰어난 지적 능력을 갖고 있다는 것을 알게되었다. 헬리안드는 아르테움 섬에서 주술사로 훈련받았던 자신과 소년과의 공통점을 발견했다.\n"
"\n"
"극단이 서머셋의 극동지역에 있는 포탄사마을에서 공연을 하던때에, 헬리안드는 11살의 트레치투스를 아르테움 섬으로 데리고 갔다. 그 섬의 현자, 이아케시스 는, 트레치투스의 잠재력을 알아채고 그에게 바누스 갈라리온 이라는 이름을 지어주고 제자로 받아들였다. 바누스는 아르테움 섬에서 그의 몸과 정신을 단련했다.\n"
"\n"
"이렇게 해서 마법사 길드의 첫번째 대현자가 훈련을 받게된 것이다. 그는 아르테움 섬의 씨직들로부터 훈련을 받았다. 그는 유년기시절 빈곤과 부당함을 겪어왔기 때문에 지식은 서로 공유해야한다는 철학을 가지게 되었다."

"A rich Breton named Robier, often called \"Uncle\" by his neighbors, owned a great plantation whose crops fed dozens of villages. Day and night his serfs worked the fields, plucking aphids and worms out by their fingernails if they had to in order to make the produce the best and most delicious in all of High Rock.\n"
"\n"
"Then the Creature invaded his fields. Beneath the noses of the workers, it devoured potatoes and cabbages, carrots and lettuce, radishes and beans.\n"
"\n"
"It stumped the efforts of the serfs to catch it. Sometimes, people would think they had it, dive forward to grab it, and impale themselves on tools left upon the ground! Other times, the Creature would sneak up behind them in broad daylight and push them over to break their necks! \n"
"\n"
"It was believed that Uncle Robier was cursed somehow, and the Creature was some kind of revenge for a person he had wronged in his past. The serfs abandoned the fields, willing to risk a week in the stocks rather than death at the hands of the Creature.\n"
"\n"
"Soon Uncle Robier's fields were stripped bare by the ravenous Creature, and even he began to believe the superstition himself. He locked himself in his chateau and pleaded to the Divines, but they were silent. All Robier could hear was the sound of the Creature scratching beneath the floorboards, inside the walls, and in his cupboards as it devoured all he had left to eat.\n"
"\n"
"Huddled inside his bedroom in the dark of night, Robier watched as his last candle burned itself to a nub and went out. Then the Creature devoured him as well."

"부유한 브레튼인 Robier은 종종 이웃들에게 \"삼촌\"이라 불리곤 했다. 그는 마을 몇십 개를 먹여살릴 수 있을 정도로 거대한 농장을 가지고 있었다. 그의 농노들은 하이 락에서 제일 품질이 뛰어나고 맛있는 작물을 생산하기 위해 밤낮으로 일했다. 그들은 손톱으로 진딧물을 없애고 벌레를 잡았다.\n"
"\n"
"그런데 갑자기 괴물이 농장을 침공했다. 그들은 농노들 코 앞에서 감자, 양배추, 당근, 상추, 무, 콩 등을 먹어치웠다.\n"
"\n"
"농노들은 괴물들을 잡으려 했지만 소용 없었다. 숨어서 붙잡으려 하면 땅에 놓여 있던 농기구에 찔렸다! 아니면 대낮에 농노들 등 뒤까지 접근해 목을 꺾어 버렸다!\n"
"\n"
"Robier 삼촌은 이 괴물들이 과거에 학대했던 사람들이 내린 저주라고 믿게 되었다. 농노들은 괴물들 손에 죽느니 농장을 버리고 일주일 동안 밖에 매달리는 벌을 받는 걸 택했다.\n"
"\n"
"곧 Robier 삼촌의 농장은 굶주린 괴물들에 의해 황폐화되었고, 그는 미신에 매달리기 시작했다. 그는 저택 안에 틀어박혀 디바인들에게 간청하였지만, 그들은 침묵하였다. Robier의 귀에는 괴물들이 마루 아래를 긁어대고, 벽 안쪽으로 들어와 찬장의 먹을 것을 모두 집어삼키는 소리만 들릴 뿐이었다.\n"
"\n"
"Robier은 어두운 밤중에 침실에 웅크린 채로 마지막 촛불이 타서 사라지는 것을 지켜보았다. 그리고 나서 괴물들은 그를 먹어치웠다.\n"

"A Report to the Royal Family of Hegathe\n"
"\n"
"By Doctor Tazhim of the Bureau of Outlander Affairs\n"
"\n"
"O Beloved of Morwha, Blessed by Zeht's Tears,\n"
"\n"
"Your ignoble servant apologizes for his unworthy existence, and seeks forgiveness for intruding his negligible thoughts into Your Majesties' lofty meditations. In response to your momentary whim of last week, which was to me as an ironclad order, I have prepared a report on the recent outbreak of unholy undeath in the northern Alik'r, and its unorthodox means of suppression.\n"
"\n"
"I have spoken before about the Ash'abah, a pariah tribe of the northern wastes who are shunned for their unclean interactions with our risen ancestors. Though their origins are ancient, the fact that such an aberration could persist into the modern era must be attributed to covert support by shameless elements of the Forebears, who tolerate the most outrageous non-traditional practices. \n"
"\n"
"This hypothesis would seem to be validated by recent events, which I shall now have the honor to recount to Your Majesties. In Sentinel, the usurper Fahara'jad had gathered to him a circle of advisors, some of whom were of untarnished reputation, but others of whom were known Forebear activists who had almost openly opposed the Divines-blessed rule of the late King Ramzi (may Tu'whacca escort his soul to the Far Shores). One of these questionable viziers, Suturah by name, seems to have been not only a bad advisor, but also a secret necromancer. As far as our agents of the Bureau have been able to reconstruct it, this Suturah slew all of \"King\" Fahara'jad's other viziers, then reanimated them in an attempt to kill Fahara'jad himself. The attempt was a failure: Fahara'jad escaped, but so did Suturah. \n"
"\n"
"Suturah fled to the east, where he was joined by elements of the Cult of the Black Worm (which Your Majesties will recall from my report of 2nd Rain's Hand). Undead, mostly Ra-Netu, were raised in numbers from forgotten graveyards in the deep desert, and Suturah led his unclean minions back toward Sentinel. \n"
"\n"
"Shockingly, our informants state that Fahara'jad contaminated himself by personally appealing to the pariah Ash'abah, asking them to intervene against Suturah. The Ash'abah headman, Marimah, agreed, though we have been unable to discover what degrading terms were imposed upon Fahara'jad. In a surprise ambush the Ash'abah, using forbidden mystical means, destroyed Suturah's army of Ra-Netu. Suturah himself, it is said, fell under the blade of the exile Marimah. \n"
"\n"
"Fahara'jad, of course, has been careful to stay quiet about his appeal to the Ash'abah, and has publicly thanked the Divines for holy intervention on Sentinel's behalf. I leave it to Your Majesties to decide if we should spread about the rumor of the Forebear usurper's impure meeting with the pariahs."

"Know, O Prince, that in the time of the Ra Gada, the Forebears did come to Hammerfell from doomed Yokuda. First they landed at Hegathe, which they freed of the affliction of the beast-peoples. Then spread they bothwise along the coasts, seeking out goodly harbors and well-watered oases. \n"
"\n"
"To the north and west went the warrior-sailors of the Grandee Yaghoub, in the great ships they had brought from Akos Kasaz, until they rounded Cape Shira. Then was Yaghoub the first of the Ra Gada to behold the Iliac Bay, and he deemed it laudable, and praised its excellences, and vowed to make his home thenceforth upon its shores.\n"
"\n"
"And as Yaghoub sailed toward the Steed at dawning of the seventeenth of Second Seed, his watchman cried out that he spied a desirable harborage. And Yaghoub, perceiving it, agreed, and said, \"This harborage shall belong to us, for we shall take it to be ours. And I do name it Sentinel, after the one who first espied it.\"\n"
"\n"
"Then Sentinel (for thus ever after was it known) already contained a port on its harbor, which port was the haunt of low Elves, and Men who did consort with Elves. And the shores were green with the leaves of pomegranate, and fig, and olive, and the men of the Grandee saw this and were hungry, and sought to come ashore, despite the warnings and cries of the port-rabble.\n"
"\n"
"But when Yaghoub landed with his warrior-sailors, with their bright swords and peaked helms, the port-rabble were cowed, and spake, cringing, \"What would you with us, O mighty sword-singers? Slay us not, for we have done you no harm.\"\n"
"\n"
"And Yaghoub said to them, \"Nay, though you are infidels and partake of unclean practices, I will not slay you. For I have a thought to build me a palace upon the height above the harbor, and such labor is not meet for my noble warrior-sailors. Therefore you shall live, and become masons, and stonewrights, and servants of the house.\"\n"
"\n"
"And thus was the true port of Sentinel founded. The port-rabble found purpose in their new labors, and built the walls, and the marketplace, and the palace of Yaghoub. And this was Samaruik, of glorious name, and legendary are the mighty kings and queens who have reigned from it since. For the Crowns who followed the Forebears found Sentinel a worthy seat, and many were the Na-Totambu who settled there. \n"
"\n"
"Even today, O Prince, above the city gates flies always a banner of the crescent moon, for this was the banner of the Grandee Yaghoub, which has become the symbol of Sentinel in remembrance of him. And the faithful celebrate the Grandee on the Koomu Alezer'i Yaghoub, every seventeenth of Second Seed, when we share pomegranates in honor of our esteemed ancestor."

"오 왕자이시여, Ra Gada의 시대에, Forebears는 멸망한 Yokuda에서 해머펠로 찾아온 것입니다. 그들은 Hegathe에 처음 상륙해 수인들을 고통에서 해방시켜 주었습니다. 그 후에는 거대한 항구와 수질이 좋은 오아시스를 찾아 해안선을 따라 두 방향으로 나뉘었습니다.\n"
"\n"
"북쪽과 서쪽으로 향한 것은 Yaghoub 대공의 전사인 선원들입니다. 그들은 Akos Kasaz에서 가져온 훌륭한 배를 타고 Shira 곶을 둘러보았습니다. 그리고 Ra Gada 중 처음으로 Iliac 만을 본 Yaghoub는 그곳을 훌륭히 여기고 칭송한 후, 그 해변을 고향으로 삼겠다고 맹세했습니다.\n"
"\n"
"두 번째 파종 17일 새벽, Yaghoub가 기마자리 쪽으로 향해하는 도중 감시병이 완벽한 정박 장소를 찾아냈다고 외쳤습니다. Yaghoub는 그 말을 듣고 동의하며 말했습니다. \"이 정박소는 이제 우리의 것이다. 우리가 손에 넣을 것이다. 이곳을 처음 발견한 자의 이름을 따서 센티넬이라 명명하겠다.\"\n"
"\n"
"그 센티넬(이후에도 그렇게 불렀다)의 항구에는 이미 도시가 있었고, 하급 엘프와 그 동료들이 드나들고 있었습니다. 해안은 석류와 무화과, 올리브의 녹색 잎으로 덮여 있었습니다. 이를 보고 배가 고픈 부하들은 항구의 군중들의 경고와 고함소리를 무시하고 해안으로 다가가려고 했습니다.\n"
"\n"
"하지만 Yaghoub가 전사인 선원들과 함께 빛나는 검을 차고 챙 달린 투구를 쓰고 해안에 내렸을 때, 군중들은 두려움에 떨며 말했습니다. \"우리를 어떻게 하실 생각입니까, sword-singers이시여? 우리는 아무 해도 입히지 않았습니다. 부디 목숨만은 살려 주십시오.\"\n"
"\n"
"Yaghoub가 그들에게 말했습니다. \"좋다, 그대들이 비록 신앙을 버리고 부정한 행위를 저지르기는 하였으나 그대들을 해치지는 않겠다. 나는 항구보다 높이 솟은 궁전을 지으려 하나 그런 노동은 나의 고결한 부하들에게 어울리지 않는다. 그러니 너희의 목숨을 살려주는 대가로, 석공과 석수, 내 집의 하인이 되어라.\"\n"
"\n"
"이리하여 센티넬에 진정한 항구가 만들어졌습니다. 항구의 군중들은 새로운 노동을 하며 목적을 가지고 벽과 시장, Yaghoub의 궁전을 만들었습니다. 이 궁전에는 Samaruik이라는 영광스러운 이름이 붙었습니다. 이후 이곳에서 통치한 왕과 여왕들은 전설을 남겼습니다. Forebears에 이어 왕가에 걸맞은 장소를 센티넬에서 발견한 것입니다. 그곳에 정착한 대다수는 Na-Totambu였습니다. \n"
"\n"
"오 왕자이시여, 오늘날까지도 도시의 관문 위에는 언제나 초승달 깃발이 휘날립니다. 초승달은 Yaghoub 대공을 추억하는 의미로 센티넬의 상징이 되었습니다. 매년 두 번째 파종 17일은 Koomu Alezer'i Yaghoub의 날로써 그를 기리고 있습니다. 이 날은 우리의 위대한 조상에게 경의를 표하며 석류를 서로 나눕니다."

"By Lady Clarisse Laurent\n"
"\n"
"It is strange that the Elven ruins known as Salas En, on the Hammerfell coast at Cape Shira, have never been properly explored or studied. This is most likely due to the superstitious locals' exaggerated reverence for burial grounds of the dead, even those of other cultures. I wouldn't go so far as to accuse the Alik'r Redguards of timidity, but really, having to bring all my own people over the bay from High Rock is a bit much. \n"
"\n"
"In any event, now that we are on our way, we shall do the job right. The known facts about Salas En are few, but they are fascinating, as it has been inhabited over the last three eras by a series of cultures. On top—which makes it most recent, of course—are Redguard relics dating from the First-Era occupation of Salas En by Crowns of the late Ra Gada. Colonists from the island of Yath in lost Yokuda, these Redguards seem to have displaced the Elves who previously occupied the site. It appears these descendants of Yath occupied Salas En until abandoning it in the middle 23rd century, which coincides with the ravages of the Thrassian Plague. \n"
"\n"
"The Elves the Yath Redguards displaced were, according to tradition, relatively recent Altmeri colonists of the Corelanya Clan, who were said to be Daedra-worshipers. (This would account for their emigration from Summerset to the austere shores of Hammerfell.) They seem to have arrived sometime in the sixth century 1E, inhabiting and expanding on structures originally built by the Ayleids. Bosmeri relics are intermixed here with classic high-period Altmeri, suggesting that either the Corelanya participated in the Wood Elf coastal trade, then at its historic height, or that Salas En was used as a stopover by Bosmeri merchants before the Corelanya arrived. \n"
"\n"
"Below these High Elf additions—and indeed, still standing with less wear on them than any of the structures built afterward—are the original Ayleid stoneworks, jutting proudly toward the heavens despite the passage of millennia. The Ayleid Elves who built Salas En are virtually unknown to history, and it is primarily to reveal their story that I have organized this expedition. With the assistance of my experienced and hand-picked team of excavators, I have every confidence that we can persuade the stones of Salas En to reveal their secrets to us."

"Unto the Doyen of Satakalaam:\n"
"\n"
"It is with a heavy heart that this unworthy one must report a cessation of the Motalion Endeavor. Circumstances have eventuated that render its continuance inadvisable. Indeed, pursuing the Endeavor would doubtless lead to a loss of Guild lives, as well as being sacrilegious (even more than usual). \n"
"\n"
"I hasten to point out that no taint of fault should be inferred as to the perfection of your peerless plans, O my Doyen. Following your instructions, our subversion of Motalion Funerary Overseer Parvizh al-Tigonus went flawlessly—indeed, he was willing to accept only 15 percent of the pillaging proceeds when we were willing to go as high as 20 percent. In the weeks since he agreed to our proposal, the looting of the crypts and mausoleums in the southern quadrant of the necropolis was accomplished according to Your Doyenhood's admirably aggressive schedule, despite the back injury suffered by Footpad Quyen in the Crypt of Virtuous Maidens.\n"
"\n"
"The harvesting and sale of the Sacred Welkynds was likewise a complete success, and your idea of substituting imitation stones of turquoise glass treated with glow-spells has left none the wiser. The cost of paying Affab the Illuminary to renew the glow-spells once every ten-day is scarab-feed compared to what we were able to realize from the welkynd stones on the thaumaturgical after-market. \n"
"\n"
"In hindsight, your advice that we start with the quadrant wherein were interred the most affluent of our ancestors fully justifies the eminent position in which you find yourself. Though we refrained, of course, from irreverent treatment of the sarcophagi, the valuable trappings and regalia of the outer tombs were stripped during those periods when Overseer Parvizh had the watchmen patrolling elsewhere. It is unlikely that the eastern and western quadrants, where the less prosperous of our brethren are buried, would even together equal the take brought in from the southern. \n"
"\n"
"But now I must reluctantly turn to the reason for our regrettable abandonment of Your Doyenhood's supremely excellent Motalion Endeavor. The northern quadrant, where the authorities have seen fit to bury the corpses of those who were impious or criminal in life, has been afflicted by a horrific rising of undead. Ra-Netu in numbers have crawled from their crypts, and are now a profane presence across the entire necropolis. This may be due, as I believe, to Overseer Parvizh sending the watchmen too often into the unclean quadrant, or it may be the result of some other desecration. If it was the fault of the Overseer, he has certainly paid the price, as he was one of the first victims of these risen dead. \n"
"\n"
"I also regret to report the death of Footpad Quyen, whose back went out in an untimely manner while fleeing from a Ra-Netu at the base of the Ninety-Nine Stairs. His surviving family will receive the usual stipend. \n"

"\n"
"The Forebears, who have been longest in Tamriel and had the stronger relationship with the Second Empire, worship substantially the same pantheon as the Imperials and Bretons, whereas the more conservative Crowns still revere the ancient Yokudan gods.\n"
"\n"
"The Eight of the Forebears\n"
"\n"
"Akatosh (Dragon God of Time):\n"
"Akatosh is the chief deity of the Eight Divines (the major religious cult of Cyrodiil and its provinces), and one of two deities found in every Tamrielic religion (the other is Lorkhan). He is generally considered to be the first of the Gods to form in the Beginning Place; after his establishment, other spirits found the process of being easier and the various pantheons of the world emerged. He embodies the qualities of endurance, invincibility, and everlasting legitimacy.\n"
"\n"
"Tava (Bird God):\n"
"Yokudan spirit of the air. Tava is most famous for leading the Yokudans to the isle of Herne after the destruction of their homeland. She has since become assimilated into the mythology of Kynareth, and is often worshiped by the Forebears in that name. She is very popular in Hammerfell among sailors, and her shrines can be found in most port cities.\n"
"\n"
"Julianos (God of Wisdom and Logic):\n"
"Often associated with Jhunal, the Nords' father of language and mathematics, Julianos is the god of literature, law, history, and contradiction, and is thus the patron of magistrates (and wizards).\n"
"\n"
"Dibella (Goddess of Beauty):\n"
"Popular god of the Eight Divines. She has nearly a dozen different cults, some devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction.\n"
"\n"
"Tu'whacca (Tricky God):\n"
"Yokudan god of souls. Tu'whacca, before the creation of the world, was the god of Nobody Really Cares. When Tall Papa undertook the creation of the Walkabout, Tu'whacca found a purpose; he became the caretaker of the Far Shores, and continues to help Redguards find their way into the afterlife. His cult is sometimes associated with Arkay in the more cosmopolitan regions of Hammerfell, and he is often worshiped in that name by Forebears.\n"
"\n"
"Zeht (God of Farms):\n"
"Yokudan god of agriculture who renounced his father after the world was created, which is why Akatosh makes it so hard to grow food. Analogous to Zenithar, and sometimes worshiped in that name.\n"
" \n"
"Morwha (Teat God):\n"
"Yokudan fertility goddess. Fundamental deity in the Yokudan pantheon, and the favorite of Tall Papa's wives. Still worshiped in various areas of Hammerfell, including Stros M'kai. Morwha is always portrayed as four-armed, so that she can \"grab more husbands.\" Analogous to Mara, and sometimes worshiped in that name by the Forebears.\n"
"\n"
"Stendarr (God of Mercy):\n"
"Stendarr's sphere includes compassion, charity, justice, and righteous rule, and is the favorite god of Redguard \"gallants\" (knights).\n"
"\n"
"Additional Deities with Significant Redguard Cults:\n"
"\n"
"Leki (Saint of the Spirit Sword):\n"
"Divine daughter of Tall Papa, Leki is the goddess of aberrant swordsmanship. The Na-Totambu of Yokuda warred to a standstill during the mythic era to decide who would lead the charge against the Lefthanded Elves. Their swordmasters, though, were so skilled in the Best Known Cuts as to be matched evenly. Leki introduced the Ephemeral Feint. Afterwards, a victor emerged and the war with the Aldmer began.\n"
" \n"
"HoonDing (The Make Way God):\n"
"Yokudan spirit of \"perseverance over infidels.\" The HoonDing has historically materialized whenever the Redguards need to \"make way\" for their people. In Tamrielic history this has only happened twice, in the First Era during the Ra Gada invasion.\n"
" \n"
"Malooc (Horde King):\n"
"An enemy god of the Ra Gada who led the Goblins against the Redguards during the First Era. Fled east when the army of the HoonDing overtook his Goblin hordes.\n"
" \n"
"Sep (The Snake):\n"
"Yokudan version of Lorkhan. Sep is born when Tall Papa creates someone to help him regulate the spirit trade. Sep, though, is driven crazy by the hunger of Satakal, and he convinces some of the gods to help him make an easier alternative to the Walkabout. This, of course, is the world as we know it, and the spirits who followed Sep become trapped here, to live out their lives as mortals. Sep is punished by Tall Papa for his transgressions, but his hunger lives on as a void in the stars, a \"non-space\" that tries to upset mortal entry into the Far Shores."

"타바 (새의 신):\n"
"공중에 떠 있는 요쿠다의 영혼이다. 타바는 요쿠다의 고향이 파괴된 이후 헤르네 섬으로 이끌고 간 것으로 가장 유명하다. 그녀는 이후 키나레스의 신화 속에 동화되었고, 종종 그 이름으로 Forebears에게 숭배되기도 한다. 해머펠의 선원들 사이에서 가장 유명한 존재로, 대부분의 항구 도시에서 그녀의 사원을 발견할 수 있다.\n"

" \n"
"훈딩 (길을 여는 신):\n"
"\"이교도를 향한 인내\"를 상징하는 요쿠다의 신. 훈딩은 레드가드 종족이 \"길을 열어야 할\" 필요가 요구될 때마다 역사적으로 강림하였다. 탐리엘 역사상 그런 일은 단 두 번 있었는데, 제1시대에 라 가다가 침공했을 때이다.\n"

"Satakal (The Worldskin):\n"
"Yokudan god of everything, a fusion of the concepts of Anu and Padomay. Basically, Satakal is much like the Nords' Alduin, who destroys one world to begin the next. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal had done (and still does) this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition. These spirits ultimately become the Yokudan pantheon. Popular god among the Crowns of the Alik'r nomads.\n"
"\n"
"Ruptga (Tall Papa):\n"
"Chief deity of the Yokudan pantheon. Ruptga, more commonly \"Tall Papa,\" was the first god to figure out how to survive the Hunger of Satakal. Following his lead, the other gods learned the \"Walkabout,\" or a process by which they can persist beyond one lifetime. Tall Papa set the stars in the sky to show lesser spirits how to do this, too. When there were too many spirits to keep track of, though, Ruptga created a helper out the dead skin of past worlds.

"요쿠다 문화권의 가장 높은 신이다. \"톨 파파\"라는 이름으로 더 유명하다. 사타칼의 굶주림으로부터 살아남는 방법을 알아낸 최초의 신이다. 다른 신들은 그의 선례를 따라 어떻게 하면 한 번의 생을 넘어 계속 남아있을 수 있는지 알게 되었다. 톨 파파는 하늘에 별을 놓아 두어 약한 영혼들도 그 방법을 배울 수 있도록 하였다. 그러나 너무 많은 영혼들이 그 방법을 따르게 되자, 룹트가는 이전 세계로부터 죽은 살점을 떼어내 도우미를 창조했다. 이 도우미가 바로 훗날 필멸자의 세계를 만든 셉(아래 참조)이다.\n"

"타바 (새의 신):\n"
"공중에 떠 있는 요쿠다의 영혼이다. 타바는 요쿠다의 고향이 파괴된 이후 헤르네 섬으로 이끌고 간 것으로 가장 유명하다. 그녀는 이후 키나레스의 신화 속에 동화되었다. 여전히 해머펠의 선원들 사이에서 가장 유명한 존재로, 대부분의 항구 도시에서 그녀의 사원을 발견할 수 있다.\n"

"디아그나 (검을 비껴 찬 오리할콘 신):\n"
"레드가드의 매우 오래되고 폭력적인 신앙이다. 스물일곱 뱀 일족의 살육이 일어난 후 요쿠다에게 전승되었다. 디아그나는 영원함을 쟁취해낸 훈딩 (요쿠다의 길을 여는 신, 아래 참조)의 화신이었다. 요쿠다 종족들에게 오리할콘 무기를 전해 줘 왼손잡이 엘프들을 물리치는 데 공헌했다. 고대 전성기, 그는 탐리엘에서 매우 유대가 긴밀한 추종자들을 이끌고 오시니움의 오크들에게 대항했다.\n"

"\n"
"훈딩 (길을 여는 신):\n"
"\"이교도를 향한 인내\"를 상징하는 요쿠다의 신. 훈딩은 레드가드 종족이 \"길을 열어야 할\" 필요가 요구될 때마다 역사적으로 강림하였다. 탐리엘 역사상 그런 일은 단 두 번 있었는데, 제1시대에 라 가다가 침공했을 때이다.\n"

"셉 (뱀):\n"
"로칸의 요쿠다 판이다. 톨 파파가 영혼 거래를 조절하기 위해 탄생시켰다. 하지만 셉은 사타칼의 굶주림으로 미칠 지경이 되었고, 더 쉬운 대안을 모색하는 것을 돕도록 다른 신들을 설득했다. 물론 이것이 우리가 아는 현재의 세계이며, 셉을 따르던 영혼들은 이곳에 갇혀 필멸자로서 삶을 보내게 되었다. 셉은 이 비도덕적인 행위로 인하여 톨 파파에게 처벌을 받게 되었으나, 그의 굶주림은 별들 사이의 허공으로 남겨졌고, 그 \"무공간\"은 필멸자들이 Far Shores으로 들어가는 것을 방해하곤 한다."

"Torn's Sword Hunt had separated the Singers from the common people, and the rise of the Last Emperor began the last great strife of the desert empire: the Emperor and his consort Elisa's final effort to wrest control of the empire from the people by destroying the sword-singers. Hira vowed to search out every Singer with his Brigand army composed of Orcs and castoffs of the wars of the empire, and to scourge them from the face of the planet.\n"
"\n"
"The sword-singers were never a numerous people. The harsh desert kept the births few, and growing up in the unforgiving wastes eliminated all but those of iron spirit and will. Thus the final strife, which became known as the \"War of the Singers,\" found the people of the sword unprepared and unready to join together their individually great skills into an army that could defend their homes and lives.\n"
"\n"
"Frandar Hunding was sought out, his death poem interrupted, and unceremoniously command of the singers was thrust upon him. To the unknown gods of war great thanks is owed that Hunding had the time in his cave to write down his years of accumulated wisdom, of strategy, of the way of the Shehai. The singers fled from their camps up into the desert hills and mountains, fled to the foot of Hattu, \"the Father of Mountains,\" where Hunding had gone to write in peace and to die. There those remnants formed into the Army of the Circle—they learned Hunding's Way, his strategies, his tactics, and the final great vision for a master stroke.\n"
"\n"
"Hunding devised a plan of seven battles, leading the Armies of Hira further and further into the wilderness to the foot of Hattu, where the final battle could be fought. Hunding called his plan the \"Hammer and the Anvil.\" With each battle Hunding's Singers would further learn his strategies and tactics, grow strong in the use of the Shehai, and be ready to defeat their opponents in the seventh battle. And thus it was, the six first battles were waged, each neither victory or defeat, each leading to the next. The larger armies of Hira following the small army of Hunding. Outnumbered thirty to one, the singers never faltered from the Way. The stage was set: Hira and his army maneuvered to the base of Hattu Mountain, where the hammer blow was delivered. The battle was pitched, and many singers fell that day. Hunding knew that the singers who lived would be few, but Hira and his empire of evil would not live—and so it went.\n"
"\n"
"At the end Hunding and less than twenty thousand singers survived the day, but no army of evil was left to pillage and murder—more than three hundred thousand fell that day on Hattu. Of those who were left to run and live, all were scattered to the four winds, an organized force no more.\n"
"\n"
"The singers packed their lives, folded their tents, mourned their dead, and followed Hunding to the great port city of Arch, in the province of Seawind. There Hunding had a flotilla of ships waiting. The singers left their desert for a new land. No longer welcome in the desert empire, they left to be sung about and spoken of in legend. The final great warrior, the singers of Shehai, the Book of Circles, all leaving that land where their virtue was unappreciated. Red, red with blood they were in the eyes of the gentle citizenry, never mind that they had saved them from a great evil.\n"
"\n"
"The singers vowed to learn new ways as they traveled across the great ocean to their new land. To adopt a new name, but to honor the past. In honor of their final battle, they named their new land Hammerfell and adopted the name Redguards.\n"
"\n"
"In honor to Hunding the great warrior prince, each household in Hammerfell has a place by the hearth, an alcove really, just a niche, big enough to hold the scroll: The Book of Circles."

"Frandar do Hunding Hel Ansei No Shira or, as he is commonly known, Frandar Hunding, was born in the far desert marches in the province of High Desert. \"Hunding\" is the name of the High Desert region near where he was born. \"No Shira\" means \"noble person\" or \"person of noble birth\" and \"Hel Ansei\" is his title of Sword Sainthood.\n"
"\n"
"Hunding's ancestors reach back to the beginning of recorded time in the high desert, living as artisans and mystics. His grandfather was a retainer of the Elden Yokeda, Mansel Sesnit, and led many of the battles of unification prior to Sesnit's assassination.\n"
"\n"
"When he was 14, Hunding's father died in the one of the many insurrections, and he was left to support his mother and four brothers. His prowess with the sword, however, made his life both difficult and easy. It was easy in that his services came in great demand as a guardian and escort. It was hard in that his reputation preceded him, and many awaited their turn to face him in battle, hoping to gain instant fame through his defeat.\n"
"\n"
"By the time Hunding was thirty, he had fought and won more than ninety duels, killing all his opponents. He became virtually invincible with the sword, gaining such skill and mastery that he finally stopped using the real swords created through the artistry of his people and began using the Shehai or \"way of the spirit sword.\"\n"
"\n"
"All sword-singers learn through their intense training and devotion to the gods of war and way of the sword, the forms of discipline that allow the creation of the spirit sword. This is a simple form of magic or mind mastery whereby an image of a sword is formed from pure thought. The sword singer forms the sword by concentrating, and it takes shape in his hand. It is usually a pale thing of light, misty and insubstantial, a thing of beauty perhaps, or a symbol of devotion to the Way and the gods, but no weapon. However, those Ansei of the highest level and sensitivity and those with talent in magic can in times of stress form a spirit sword: a Shehai that is far more than light and air. It is an unstoppable weapon of great might, a weapon that can never be taken from the owner without also taking his mind.\n"
"\n"
"The Shehai became Hunding's weapon, and with this, he killed bands of brigands and wandering monsters infesting the land. Finally upon finishing his ninetieth duel, defeating the evil Lord Janic and his seven lich followers, he was satisfied that he was indeed invincible. Hunding then turned to formulating his philosophy of \"the Way of the Sword.\" He wrote his learnings down in the Book of Circles while living as a hermit in a cave in the mountains of the high desert in his sixtieth year.\n"
"\n"
"In that year Hunding, having enlisted in the many battles of the empire, and having defeated all opponents, had thought himself ready for death. He retired to his cave to capture his strategy and mystical visions to share with other sword-singers. It was after his completion of the scroll of the Circle that the singers found him composing his death poem and preparing to join the gods of war in final rest.\n"
"\n"
"At sixty, he was a vigorous man who thought himself through with life, but his people, the sword-singers, needed him. They needed him as never before."

"Hunding의 조상들은 high desert의 가장 처음 기록된 시기까지 거슬러 올라간다. 그들은 장인들이었고 또한 신비주의자들이었다. 그의 조부는 Elden Yokeda와 Mansel Sesnit의 가신이었으며 Sesnit의 암살 전에 많은 통일 전쟁들을 이끌었다.\n"
"\n"
"그가 14살이었을때, Hunding의 아버지는 많은 내란 중 하나에서 사망하였다. 그리고 그는 그의 어머니와 네 형제들을 부양해야만 했다. 그러나 그의 검 솜씨는 그의 삶을 쉽게도, 어렵게도 만들었다. 그의 검술은 그가 수호자나 경호원으로써 많은 수요가 있게 만들었다는 점에서 그의 삶을 쉽게 만들긴 했다. 그러나 그의 명성은 그를 앞서갔고 수많은 사람들이 그를 쓰러뜨려서 명성을 얻을 생각으로 그와 전투를 할 기회를 기다렸다.\n"

"모든 검의 노래자들은 그들의 강렬한 훈련, 전쟁의 신에 대한 헌신, 그리고 검의 길, 정신의 검을 만들 수 있게 하는 수양의 길로부터 깨달음을 얻었다. 이것은 검의 이미지를 순수한 생각을 통해 만들어 내는 마법이나 정신술의 단순한 형식이었다. 검의 노래자들은 정신을 집중함으로써 검을 만들었으며 그것은 그들의 손에서 형태를 갖추었다. 그것은 보통 창백한 빛의 형상이었고, 흐릿하고 비물질적이었으며, 아마도 아름다운 것이었고, 아니면 그들의 길과 신에 대한 헌신의 상징이었지만, 그러나 무기라고 할수는 없었다. 그러나,  가장 높은 경지에 이른 Ansei들과 마법에 재능이 있는 자들은 고통스러운 시간을 통해 실제로 정신의 검을 만들 수 있었다: Shehai는 단순한 빛과 공기 이상의 것이었다. 그것은 강력한 힘을 가진 멈출 수 없는 무기였으며, 그의 정신을 빼앗지 않고서는 절대로 주인으로부터 빼앗을 수 없는무기였다.\n"

"Frandar Hunding was born in 2356 in the old way of reckoning in our beloved deserts of the old land. The traditional rule of emperors had been overthrown in 2012, and although each successive emperor remained the figurehead of the empire, his powers were very much reduced. Since that time, our people saw three hundred years of almost continuous civil war between the provincial lords, warrior monks, and brigands, all fighting each other for land and power. Our people were once artisans, poets, and scholars, but the ever-evolving strife made the way of the sword inevitable. The song of the blade through the air, through flesh and bone, its ring against armor—it was an answer to our prayers.\n"
"\n"
"In the time of Lord Frandar the first Warrior Prince, lords called Yokeda built huge stone castles to protect themselves and their lands, and castle towns outside the walls begin to grow up. In 2245, however, Mansel Sesnit came to the fore. He became the Elden Yokeda, or military dictator, and for eight years succeeded in gaining control of almost the whole empire. When Sesnit was assassinated in 2253,a commoner took over the government. Randic Torn continued the work of unifying the empire that Sesnit had begun, ruthlessly putting down any traces of insurrection. He revived the old gulf between the warriors—the sword singers—and the commoners by introducing restrictions on the wearing of swords. \"Torn's Sword-Hunt,\" as it was known, meant that only the singers were allowed to wear swords, which distinguished them from the rest of the population.\n"
"\n"
"Although Torn did much to settle the empire into its pre-strife ways, by the time of his death in 2373 internal disturbances still had not been completely eliminated. Upon his death, civil war broke out in earnest; war that made the prior three hundred year turmoil pale in comparison. It was in this period that Frandar Hunding grew up.\n"
"\n"
"Hunding belonged to the sword-singers. This element of empire society grew from the desert artisans and was initially recruited from the young sons and daughters of the high families. They built the first temple to the unknown gods of war and built a training hall, \"The Hall of the Virtues of War.\" Within a few generations the way of the sword—the \"song of the blade\"—had become their life. The people of the blade kept their poetry and artistry in building beautiful swords woven with magic and powers from the unknown gods. The greatest among them became known as Ansei, or \"Saints of the Sword.\" Each of these began their own training schools teaching their individual way of the sword. Ansei of the highest virtue wandered the countryside engaging in battle, righting wrongs, and seeking to end the strife.\n"
"\n"
"To sum it up: Hunding was a sword-singer, a master, a Master Ansei at a time when the peak of the strife was reborn out of the chaos of Torn's death. Many singers put up their swords and became artists, for the pull of the artisan heritage was strong. Others, like Hunding, pursued the ideal of the warrior searching for enlightenment through the perilous paths of the Sword. Duels of revenge and tests of skill were commonplace, and fencing schools multiplied."

"프란다 훈딩은 구식 추정법으로 우리의 옛 땅의 사랑받는 사막에서 2356년쯤에 태어났다. 황제들의 전통적인 지배가 2012년에 전복된 이래로 일련의 황제들이 제국의 명목상의 수장으로 남았지만, 황제의 힘은 매우 약화된 상태였다. 그때부터 우리 민족들은 거의  300년간 지역의 fords와 전사-수도사들과, 산적들이 땅과 권력을 위해 끊임없이 내전을 벌이는 것을 보아왔다. 우리 민족들은 한때 장인이었고, 시인이었으며, 또한 학자들이었다. 하지만 계속 심해져만 가는 분쟁은 검의 길을 피할 수 없는 것으로 만들었다. 공기를 가르는 검의 노래, 살과 뼈를 찢어놓는, 갑옷을 때리는 소리—그것이 우리의 기원에 대한 해답이었다.\n"
"\n"
"최초의 전사 왕자 프란다경의 시대에, Yokeda라 불리우던 영주들은 거대한 성들을 그들 자신과 그들의 땅을 지키기 위해 지었다. 그리고 성 주위에 마을들이 발달하기 시작했다. 그러나 2245년에\n"
" Mansel Sesnit이 두각을 보이기 시작했다. 그는 Elden Yokeda, 혹은 군인 독재자가 되었다. 그리고 8년간 제국 전체에 대한 통제력을 가지는 데에 성공하였다. Sesnit이 2253년에 암살되었을때, 한 평범한 시민이 정권을 쥐게 된다. Randic Torn은 Sesnit가 시작했던 제국 통합 작업을 어떤 반란의 조짐도 무자비하게 짓밟으면서 계속해나갔다. 그는 검을 장비하는데 제한을 둠으로써 전사들—검의 노래자들—과 일반인 사이의 오래된 간극을 부활시켰다. \"Torn의 검 사냥\"은 알려진대로, 오직 전사들만이 검을 장착하도록 허용되는 것을 의미했다, 그리고 그것은 그들을 제국의 나머지 사람들과 구별되게 했다.\n"
"\n"
"비록 Torn이 제국을 분쟁 전 시기로 많이 되돌려 놓기는 했지만 그가 2373년에 죽었을 때 제국 내부의 불안 요소는 아직 완전히 제거되지 않은 체로 남아있었다. 그의 죽음과 함께 이전 300년의 혼란과 비견될만한 내전이 본격적으로 일어나게 된다. 그리고 이 때 프란다 훈딩이 나타나게 된다.\n"
"\n"
"훈딩은 소드-싱어의 일원이었다. 이 제국 사회의 집단은 사막 장인의 사이에서 시작되었고 처음엔 상류층 가족의 어린 자식들을 모집하는 것에서 시작되었다. 그들은 알려지지 않은 전쟁의 신에게 처음으로 바쳐진 신전을 지었고 \"전쟁의 미덕 회관\"이라는 이름의 훈련소를 지었다. 몇세대만에 검의 길—\"blade의 노래\"—는 그들의 삶이 되었다. blade의 사람들은 그들의 시와 예술을 미지의 신의 마법과 힘과 함께 벼려진 아름다운 검을 연마하면서 남겨놓았다. 그리고 그들중 가장 뛰어난 자는 Ansei, 혹은 \"검의 성자\"라고 불렸다. 이것들은 모두 그들이 자신들의 훈련 학교에서 그들 자신의 검법은 가르치는 데에서 시작되었다. 가장 뛰어난 Ansei는 시골지역을 돌아다니면서 전투에 참여하고, 부정을 바로잡고, 분쟁을 끝날 길을 찾았다.\n"
"\n"
"요약하자면: 훈딩은 Torn의 죽음에서 혼돈으로부터 분쟁이 다시 최고조에 이르렀을 시기의 검의 노래자였고, 달인이었으며, Master Ansei였다. 대부분의 노래자들은 장인들의 유산이 주는 끌림이 너무도 강했기에 그들의 검을 들었고 예술가가 되었다. 훈딩같은 몇몇 사람들은 검의 극도로 위험한 길을 통해 깨우침을 찾는 전사의 이상을 추구했다. 복수의 결투와 기술의 시험은 흔했으며, 검술학교들은 늘어났다."

"By Lady Cinnabar of Taneth\n"
"\n"
"No folk in Tamriel have been more misunderstood than the witches of the Glenmoril Wyrd—primarily, I believe, because all the scholars who have previously written about them have been men. This is not to say that the groundbreaking work of the Venerable Kigyo of Lilmoth and Professor Barst of Shad Astula are to be entirely discounted, merely that their objectivity has been colored and undermined by their cultural assumptions of male superiority. \n"
"\n"
"To be clear, it is not the fact that I am a woman that makes me somehow emotionally better suited to understand the sisterhood of the Glenmoril Wyrd. On the contrary, it is my proven ability to be objective in the context of traditional gender roles, as shown in my celebrated tract, \"Saint and Slave-Queen: Alessia and the Lens of Gender,\" that makes me uniquely qualified to address the subject of a single-sex society like that of the Wyrd Sisters. \n"
"\n"
"The Glenmoril Wyrd are a loose association of female witch covens who revere nature and the natural world, and incline toward Daedra-worship. Racially they are almost entirely human, though some covens include human hybrids such as Hagravens and Lamias, who usually rule the covens they live in. Their preference for life in the wilderness means their covens are usually located far from the agricultural or pastoral enclaves of \"civilized\" people, which contributes to the lack of understanding of their true natures. This has led to the Glenmoril covens nearly always being described in terms such as uncanny, reclusive, dangerous, inimical, and evil. \n"
"\n"
"In fact, the Glenmoril Wyrd are all of these things—except, I would argue, evil. It is true that they are unswervingly committed to a rejection of civilization and civilized ways; it is true they admit no male members to their covens; it is true they regard themselves as enforcers of certain \"laws of nature\" which only they recognize. This does not make them evil, just strict adherents to moral codes that are different from our own. \n"
"\n"
"The fact that the Glenmoril covens seem able to maintain their populations without admitting men into their number is also an object of suspicion for those who live in their vicinities. There is an age-old libel that the Wyrd Sisters replenish themselves by stealing girl-children from neighboring farms, but such a practice has never been documented (except in the case of the notorious Fen Witches of Hjaalmarch—but they worship Molag Bal, and child-abduction is the least of their objectionable habits). My inquiries, which have been extensive, lead me to the conclusion that in most cases covens gain new members when unwanted girl-children are brought to them by distressed parents. (What happens to unwanted boy-children in the northern regions is probably a question best left unasked.)\n"
"\n"
"Though the Glenmoril Wyrd are numerically few, geographically they are widespread, from the easternmost Greenspring Coven in central Skyrim to the westernmost coven in the Ilessan Hills of High Rock. Most of the eight or so known covens are adherents of Hircine, but the Hagfeather Coven of western Falkreath reveres Namira, the Markarth Sisters (the only urban coven) worships Mehrunes Dagon, and the aforementioned Fen Witches of Hjaalmarch are followers of Molag Bal. \n"
"\n"
"Relationships with the Reachmen, the other main Daedra-worshipers of the northern wilds, vary from coven to coven and from Reach Clan to Reach Clan. The Hagfeather Coven, the Rimerock Wyrd, and the Markarth Sisters all have cordial relations with the Reachmen, but the western covens of the Ilessan Hills and Viridian Woods have a history of conflict with the Reach Clans that dates back thousands of years. This may be accounted for by the fact that the Ilessan and Viridian Wyrd venerate the less-feral aspects of Hircine, and have even been known to provide cures for lycanthropy, whereas the Reachmen prefer Hircine's more vicious side, celebrating lycanthropy as a gift rather than a curse. \n"
"\n"
"This, then, is a summary of what is known about the widespread but elusive sisters of the Glenmoril Wyrd. Many questions, certainly, remain unanswered, and much research remains to be done. To address these issues properly, it might even be necessary to leave Taneth and mount a personal expedition into the northern wilds—assuming a generous patron steps forward to finance such a worthwhile scholarly effort."

"명확히 하자면, 전 제가 여성이라는 이유로 Glenmoril Wyrd의 여성 공동체를 감정적으로 이해하는데 더 적합하다는 것은 아닙니다. 반대로, 저의 호평받은 글 \"성자이자 노예 여왕: 알레시아 그리고 젠더의 눈\"에서 볼 수 있듯이, 제가 Wyrd 자매같은 단일 성 사회를 전통적 성 역할 속에서 객관적으로 분석할 수 있는 능력이 증명되었다는 거죠.\n"
"\n"
"Glenmoril Wyrd는 자연과 자연 세계를 숭배하고, 데이드라 숭배 경향을 지닌 여성 마녀 집회들의 느슨한 연합입니다. 종족적으로 그들은 거의 인간이에요, 몇몇 집회들은 헤그레이븐이나 라미아같은 보통 집회를 지배하는 인간 혼종을 포함하긴 했지만 말이죠. 그들의 야생에서의 삶에 대한 선호는 그들의 집회들이 대체로 농업이나 목축을 하는 \"문명화된\" 사람들의 집단과 보통 멀리 떨어져 있다는 것을 의미하고, 이것이 Glenmoril Wyrd에 대한 이해의 결여에 기여를 했습니다.  그래서 Glenmoril 집회들은 거의 항상 이상한, 세상을 버린, 위험한, 적대적인, 그리고 사악한 같은 단어들로 표현되곤 했죠\n"
"\n"
"사실, Glenmoril Wyrd들에 대한 이런 수식들은 대부분 맞습니다, 사악하다는 단어 빼고는 말이죠. 그들이 확고하게 문명과 문명화된 방식을 거부했던 것은 사실입니다; 그들이 그들의 집회에 남성 구성원을 허용하지 않았다는 것도 사실이죠; 그들이 그들 자신을 \"자연의 법칙\"을 집행하는 사람들이라고(그들 자신만 그렇게 생각했지만) 생각했던 것도 사실입니다. 하지만 이것이 그들을 사악하다고 결정짓는것은 아니에요, 그져 그들은 우리 자신의 도덕적 규칙과는 다른 규칙의 엄격한 지지자였을 뿐이죠.\n"
"\n"
"Glenmoril 집회들이 그들의 인구를 그들 안에 남성을 받아들이지 않고도 유지할 수 있었다는 사실 또한 그들 근방에 사는 사람들의 의심의 대상이었습니다.  Wyrd 자매들이 그들의 구성원을 근처 농장들의 딸들을 납치해서 충당한다는 오래된 비방도 있죠, 하지만 그러한 일은 실제로 관찰된 적은 없습니다 (악명높은 Hjaalmarch의 Fen Witches를 제외하면 말이죠—하지만 그들은 몰라그 발을 숭배했습니다, 그리고 유괴는 그들이 한 짓중 가장 평범한 짓에 불과하죠). 제가 여러가지로 조사해 본 결과, 사실은 힘들어하는 부모들이 그들의 원하지 않는 딸을 Glenmoril 마녀들에게 데려와서 그들의 구성원들을 충당하게 한다는 결론을 내리게 했습니다. (북쪽 지방의 이런 남자 애들이 어떻게 됬는지는 궁금해 하지 않는게 더 좋아 보여요.)\n"
"\n"
"Glenmoril Wyrd가 수적으로는 소수이지만, 지리학적으로는 넓게 퍼져있습니다, 동쪽 끝으로는 Skyrim 중앙의 Greenspring 집회로부터, 서쪽 끝으로는 High Rock지방의 Ilessan 언덕들에 있는 집회까지요. 여뎗개 쯤 되는 것으로 알려진 집회들의 대부분은 허씬의 지지자들입니다, 하지만 Falkreath 서쪽의 Hagfeather 집회는 나미라를 숭배하고, Markarth Sisters(유일한 도시 집회입니다)는 메이룬스 데이건을 숭배합니다, 그리고 전에 말했듯 Hjaalmarch의 Fen Witches들은 몰라그 발의 숭배자들이죠.\n"
"\n"
"북쪽 야생지의 또 다른 주요한 데이드라 숭배자들인 Reachmen들과의 관계는 집회마다 다르고 Reach 부족마다 다릅니다. Hagfeather 집회, Rimerock Wyrd, 그리고 Markarth Sisters들은 모두 Reachmen들과 우호적인 관계를 유지하고 있습니다, 하지만 Ilessan 언덕들과 Viridian 숲에 있는 서쪽 집회들은 Reach 부족들과 수천년간 이어진 대립의 역사를 가지고 있죠. 이것은 아마 Reachmen들이 늑대인간화를 저주라기보다는 선물로서 숭배하고 히르신의 사악한 측면을 선호한 것과 다르게 Ilessan과 Virdian 숲의 집회들이 허씬의 덜 치명적인 측면을 숭배한다는 것과, 늑대인간화를 치료한다는 것으로 알려진 것과 관련이 있어보여요.\n"
"\n"
"이것이 광범위하게 퍼져있지만 실체를 알 수 없는 Glenmoril Wyrd의 자매들에 대해 알려진 사실들에 대한 요약입니다. 물론 아직 많은 의문점들이 남아 있고 많은 연구가  더 필요합니다. 이 과제들을 적절히 다루기 위해서, Taneth를 떠나 북쪽 야생지로의 개인적인 조사를 떠날 필요가 있을 지도 모릅니다—가치있는 학문적 과업을 위해 기꺼이 지원을 해줄 관대한 후원자가 있다면 말이죠."

"By Arthenice Belloq\n"
"\n"
"Chapter One: Abducted by the Reachmen\n"
"\n"
"I was born in Murcien's Hamlet, just north across the Bjoulsae from Evermore. My mother was a weaver, and my father was a boat-builder who made small fishing smacks and coracles for the river trade. I remember my youth as a happy one, playing around the docks where Father worked, or hunting through the near woods for entoloma caps and hickory nuts. \n"
"\n"
"It was while doing the latter one day that I strayed a bit farther from the hamlet than usual, pushed my way through a briar thicket … and suddenly found myself staring at a pair of human skulls. Startled, I shrieked and dropped my basket of nuts. By the time I realized that what I'd seen was a skull on a staff next to a woman's face painted like a skull, I'd been knocked down, bound, and thrown over her shoulder. \n"
"\n"
"I was being borne away to the north, away from my home and into the mountains. I began to kick and scream, at which the woman threw me down, bound me tighter, and gagged me into the bargain. Then she resumed carrying me off into the wild. Eventually I passed out from sheer exhaustion. \n"
"\n"
"When I awoke it was dark, but I could see forms in the dance of firelight, silhouettes sporting horns, bones, spikes, feathers. Reachmen. I closed my eyes and tried to wake up, but it was no nightmare: when I opened my eyes they were still there. \n"
"\n"
"My gag was gone, so I cried out for water. The skull-faced woman, whom I later learned was named Voanche, brought me a cup. She checked my bonds, and where I winced in pain, she actually loosened them a little. This surprised me, as I'd always heard that the Reach Clans were barbarians, wicked Daedra-worshipers who reveled in cruelty. Maybe, once they realized how distressed I was, they would set me free and send me home. \n"
"\n"
"It was a false hope: I was to be the captive of the Crow-Wife Clan for the next eight years. The Reachmen were far more complex than I had been led to believe in my Breton home, but in one thing we were right: barbarism and cruelty are everyday facts of life in the Reach. Voanche was a horse-breeder who had abducted me because she needed a slave to tend to her livestock, since her former thrall had died of a kick to the head. She had given me water and loosened my bonds solely out of concern for the condition of her new possession. \n"
"\n"
"Voanche's clan was ruled by a Hagraven named Kloavdra, a claw-fingered crone who was a witch-shaman of considerable power. She was a priestess of Namira the Spirit Daedra, the lady of ancient darkness who commands repulsive vermin such as spiders, insects, slugs, and serpents. Because Namira is the mistress of small pests, the Reachmen call her \"the Children's God\" (they are not without humor, though their jests are always malicious). At every two-moons'-dark Kloavdra would draw lots at random from the children of the clan, both Reach and slave, to select a sacrifice to the Goddess of the Dark. The chosen child would end up on the Ever-Oozing Altar where Kloavdra would cut out its heart as an offering to Namira. Every time I was sure it would be me, but the name-feather drawn was always of another. \n"
"\n"
"Kloavdra's hag-husband was a crude and vicious man named Cointthac. He was a gravesinger, a witchman shaman who could command the dead—in our land we'd call him a necromancer. He was always looking sidewise at Voanche and licking his lips, as at a savory roast fowl. Though he had power in the clan and was feared by all, Voanche treated him with disdain, which would sometimes provoke him into sending hoot-haunts into her tent at night, or hexing the horses' oats with writheworm. Voanche never turned a hair, just threatened to complain about Cointthac to his hag-wife Kloavdra, which always sent him packing. \n"
"\n"
"Life was hard in the Reach. Crow-Wife was a hunting clan, so our life was following the herds across the wastes. It was a rugged and perilous existence, where life could be snuffed out in a heartbeat by the antlers of an elk buck or the fangs of a sabre cat. But what I feared most were the semi-annual crossings of the Karth River in the wake of the tundra herds. It was my job to help Voanche and her useless daughter swim the horses across the ice-cold, swirling current, and every time I was certain would be my last. How I wished I had learned to swim in the Bjoulsae, like my two brothers, whenever the Karth had me in its grip!\n"
"\n"
"Occasionally during a crossing one of the horses would panic and break free of us, which usually meant drowning and death for it. Then Voanche and I would search far downstream until we found where its body had washed up, so we could skin and unmake the dead horse for its valuable fat, flesh, and bones. Nothing was wasted among the Reachmen. \n"
"\n"
"It was during my sixth summer as a slave of the Crow-Wives—I had crossed the hated Karth eleven times!—that I began to attract the unwanted attentions of Aiocnuall, the loutish son of Kloavdra and Cointthach. He expressed his attraction by pushing me into mud puddles or putting dead voles in my stew. He was a year younger than me, but soon I knew he would want me to the object of more than just practical jokes. As the son of the Hagraven he could do pretty much whatever he wanted with impunity, and Voanche couldn't protect me by complaining to Kloavdra—the old virago would just cackle and wave her away. \n"
"\n"
"So at night, when I should have been sleeping in my pile of furs, I started making a spear."

"So Queen Ojwa took the venerable Hallin at his word and forthwith ordered her people to march west toward Alik'r, while daily drilling from the Book of Circles. But Queen Ojwa did more: as she was a wise queen she was an Owl-Friend, and had decreed that all owls were to be honored and none slain. And in return the owls did many a favor for her. So the queen did call the Father of Owls, and asked him to bide in Ojwambu and observe Hallin's defense. \"For I would learn,\" she said, \"how one man shall defend a city entire.\"\n"
"\n"
"Even as the last of the people of Ojwambu departed from her gates to take the secret ways to Alik'r, the scouts of the tusk-folk appeared in the east, where they were noted by Hallin, for though he was old, his eyes were keen.\n"
"\n"
"Then Hallin spake, though there was none to hear but the Father of Owls, saying, \"As the snake sheds its skin, so shall the Ansei rise anew from the husks of the past.\" He raised his sword and cried, \"Sisters! Brothers! I summon you to the succor of your people, for time folds upon itself, and then-time is now.\"\n"
"\n"
"And he gestured with his blade to the left, and all along the battlements to the north there was a rustling as of snakeskins, and lo: there arose along the parapets the shadows of a legion. And there stood the semblances of all the female Ansei who ever were, and they turned to Hallin and saluted. So Hallin gestured likewise to the right, and along the battlements to the south there was a rustling, and lo: there arose the semblances of all the male Ansei who ever were. And they likewise saluted Hallin, and then all, north and south, drew their bright blades, and stood on the battlements awaiting. \n"
"\n"
"The scouts of the tusk-folk stopped forthwith to observe the defenses of Ojwambu. Surprised were they to see the battlements lined with goodly warriors, for they had been told that the folk of the city had forgot the Way of the Sword. So they did consult among themselves as to who would carry this news to Warlord Mahzgoor, and quarrel and quibble, for they feared the bearer of such news would have his head struck off. But finally the smallest, with many blows, was made to carry the report back to the Warlord. \n"
"\n"
"So the scout reported to Mahzgoor that, unaccountably, the walls of Ojwambu were lined with many goodly defenders. Of an instant the Rockhand struck off the scout's head, but then he took thought, for he was possessed of both slyness and sinew. And his thoughts were, \"What matter? We are as numberless as the sand in the dunes. We shall surround this Ojwambu, leaving neither entry nor egress. We shall despoil their fields of its provender, and stop up the streams of their flow, until no one within shall have to eat or to drink. And thus the city shall fall.\"\n"
"\n"
"So Mahzgoor ordered, and so it came to pass. The tusk-folk took their leisure among the spoils of the outworks, casting jeers and taunts at the defenders on the walls. But the defenders replied naught. So Mahzgoor and his army waited, amusing themselves most abominably at the expense of their prisoners, secure that in time the defenders of Ojwambu must wither and dwindle. \n"
"\n"
"But it was not so. Even long after when the Warlord's bone-counters calculated there must be no more to eat or to drink within the city, the defenders stood still stalwart and saying naught. So Mahzgoor summoned his shamans, saying, \"Shamans! Have we been befooled by the perfidious Redguards? Are these goodly warriors we see lining the battlements, or are they but shadows?\"\n"
"\n"
"So the shamans cast the portents, and sacrificed twin infants, and sent a scullion to the East Gate whom Hallin did spear from above. And they returned and said, \"Nay, mighty Mahzgoor, we are not befooled, for these are goodly warriors we see lining the battlements. But how they may stand when they have not to eat or to drink, this we cannot tell.\"\n"
"\n"
"Of an instant Mahzgoor struck off the shamans' heads, then raised bloody Bone-Hewer and cried, \"To arms! Form ranks! For tonight we drink the blood of the defenders of Ojwambu!\"\n"
"\n"
"Of that battle, no living Redguard survived to tell the tale. But nonetheless did wise Queen Ojwa hear of it in full, for the Father of Owls did bear the tale to her ear. He told of how Hallin and his Ansei withstood the assault, yea, for seventeen days. But though they were goodly warriors, over time the Ansei did dwindle, though each left behind only a husk like unto a snakeskin. Finally only Hallin stood at the East Gate, which was burst open by Warlord Mahzgoor with Bone-Hewer held high. And Hallin did seem to grow to match him in size, and the two met sword to sword. \n"
"\n"
"Long and long their blades clashed, until finally as the moons rose the Rockhand smote Hallin such a blow that he was struck to the ground. But even as he fell Hallin, who knew the cuts and thrusts of the Book of Circles, yea, each and every one, swung his sword and struck off the head of the Warlord Mahzgoor. Then both were dead, but in death only one was smiling and serene. \n"
"\n"
"Queen Ojwa nodded to hear this news, and said, \"It is well.\" And she turned to her mighty army of Redguard warriors, each of which knew the cuts and thrusts of the Book of Circles, yea, each and every one, and said, \"Redguards! March we now to retake our lands from the tusk-folk. And when we have regained our splendid city once more, we shall rename it Hallin's Stand. And so it shall be.\"\n"
"\n"
"And so it has been, ever after."

"From \"The History of Histories, As Told to Young Prince Fahara'jad\"\n"
"\n"
"Know then, O Prince, that after the Ra Gada had swept across Hammerfell, driving all the tusk-folk before it, a time of peace befell whereupon the people who were once Yokudans were able to lay down the sword and take up the shovel and trowel. And for three spans of a person's life all the Redguards did delve and build, and many were the Great Works that were erected above the sands. And few did study the Way of the Sword, for all were constructing monuments to the greatness of our people. \n"
"\n"
"Now east of the Alik'r and south of the Pass of Bangkorai the ever-laudable Queen Ojwa did cause to have built a city of splendor, all white stone and fluted columns, and the city was named Ojwambu, after its thrice-eminent monarch. And its streets and broad avenues were replete with houses and halls devoted to all the arts, both mercantile and inspirational. The people strolled the streets bedecked in fine garments and bedizened with bright jewels, and partaking of delicate viands and hearkening to tunes both rousing and restful. And all was pleasing thereby.\n"
"\n"
"In an unconsidered corner in the shadow of the walls stood the city's Hall of the Virtues of War, and there did the worthy Hallin, being the Last of the Ansei, teach such of Ojwambu's youth as were yet so inclined the Way of the Sword. Now these youths were few, and though they suffered raillery and unkind badinage from their peers, they found the aging Hallin an inspiration nonetheless, and learned the Way of the Sword until they became true Redguard warriors. And this was well, as you shall see. \n"
"\n"
"For in the mountain range called Dragon's-Tail the tusk-folk still lurked, beating their breasts and rending their ragged garments in rage and grievance against the Redguards. And among them was a great Goblin Warlord who had escaped the Curse of Divad through a chicanery, and thus had not been diminished. This giant Goblin was possessed of both slyness and sinew, and long he worked among the tribes of Dragon's-Tail, until one day he awoke to find himself Warlord of all the tusk-folk therein. And his name was Mahgzoor Rockhand. So Mahgzoor raised his great blade Bone-Hewer, and roared in a mighty voice like an earthquake, and declared that the day of vengeance at last was at hand. \n"
"\n"
"Then Mahgzoor led his Endwise Army down from the Dragon's-Tail, and it swept into Hammerfell like a great sandstorm, and none could stand before it. The people of the Fallen Waste fled before the fury of the tusk-folk, and many and many were those who sought refuge behind the walls of Ojwambu, until the city was overfilled thereby. The citizens cried out in distress and apprehension, saying, \"Who will fight for us, O Queen Ojwa? For we have become artisans and pleasance-wrights, and have forgotten the Way of the Sword.\"\n"
"\n"
"And Queen Ojwa spake, saying, \"Are there none among us who remember the Way of the Sword?\" Then venerable Hallin stepped forward and bowed before his monarch, saying, \"I remember the Way of the Sword, O My Queen, or at least as much as I may, for I am the Last Ansei. What I can do, I shall.\"\n"
"\n"
"Hallin's students then stepped forward as well, and laid their swords at the feet of their queen. But the thrice-eminent Ojwa was dismayed by their fewness, and spake distraught, saying, \"How shall we repel the Endwise Army with so few blades? For the tusk-folk are as numberless as the sand in the dunes.\"\n"
"\n"
"But Hallin was nowise deterred, and said boldly, \"Take heart, O Illustrious Majesty. For your people are Redguards, which means they come easily to the Way of the Sword, and once they have their hands once again on the hilts of blades, and learn to quote once more from the Book of Circles, they will be a match for any folk in all the round world, be they ever so numberless.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Be that as it may, venerable Ansei,\" replied Queen Ojwa, \"but even Redguards need time to learn the Way of the Sword, and of time we have but little.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Then you must have more. Finding you a store of time shall be my task, the culmination of the work of my life, and I swear upon Onsi's bright blade you shall have it.\" And he drew his blade, yea, even in the presence of the queen, and swore an oath upon the Brotherhood and Sisterhood of the Blade. And behold, Hallin seemed to grow to the stature of a giant, and a light shone from his blade's sharp edge, and all were obliged to avert their gaze. \n"
"\n"
"Yet when they were able to look once more, they saw naught but the venerable Hallin, smiling and sheathing his blade. And the Last Ansei raised his hands, as if to embrace all the people of Ojwambu, and said, \"Fellow Redguards, to you I bequeath the knowledge of the Book of Circles, which we have guarded long and well, that you may be equal to all threats whatsoever. These my students shall teach you their learning, and in good time you will all know once more the Way of the Sword.\"\n"
"\n"
"He turned then to Queen Ojwa and said, \"Now lead your people, O Mighty Monarch, for that is what you do best. Take them to the west, and spread the word of the Way of the Sword, that Hammerfell might make itself ready for the Endwise Army. I shall abide here in your city, which I and the other Ansei shall defend so long as we may, until our people are ready to fight for themselves.\""

"Hush, my dear. Go back to sleep. The trolls can't get you here—not so long as there is a Viridian Sentinel. \n"
"\n"
"What's that? You want to hear about the Viridian Sentinel again? Of course, my dear. Just lie back on your pillow and listen. \n"
"\n"
"Everyone in northern Bangkorai knows about the Viridian Sentinel. The Sentinel is the guardian who makes all the wild things stay in the woods. The trolls, the bears, the witches and their wolves—none may come into the vanquished lands from the Wild so long as the Sentinel keeps watch. And the Sentinel will always keep watch. \n"
"\n"
"Did you know there was a time when there was no Viridian Sentinel? It was long, long ago in the before-times. We Bretons had just won our freedom from the Direnni Elves, and the Elves were still spiteful about it. \"Go ahead, take these lands you call High Rock,\" they said. \"You will not have them long. We will retreat to our towered island. We will renounce our covenant with the Earth Bones. We will give these lands back to the Wild.\"\n"
"\n"
"As is often the way when Elves speak, we did not understand what they meant, so we merely shrugged and set about the hard work of making the land our own. We plowed fields and sowed crops. We fenced meadows and made pastures for our livestock. We built roads and market towns so our people could sell each other their produce and wares. And all seemed well. \n"
"\n"
"But then bad things began to happen on the farms nearest the woods. Witches lurked under the eaves, and Bretons who got too close to the forest began to disappear into its shadows, never to be seen again. Soon the farmers had to abandon the fields that were next to the woods. \n"
"\n"
"It got worse. Things began to come out of the woods, fell creatures and beasts, mostly at night but sometimes even in the day. And they roamed across the farmlands, menacing the farm families and slaying them when they could. Many farmers said, \"We cannot stand before these creatures from the Wild. Come, we shall leave our farms and go to the towns.\"\n"
"\n"
"But when they got to the towns they found there was no work for farmers—and even worse there was little or nothing to eat, because the farmers were no longer sending food to the towns. The townspeople blamed the farmers for abandoning their farms, and the farmers blamed the townspeople for not sending their armed watch to guard them. No one could agree on what to do. \n"
"\n"
"One of the farmboys, a lad named Greenward, was very worried. He went into the chapel and prayed earnestly to Stendarr, saying, \"O righteous lord of mercy and protection, we are in sore plight and in need of your aid. For the beasts of the Wild are no longer contained, and our lands are reverting to wilderness. Soon there will be no place for mortals who love order and harmony. I fear we will become beasts, forget our names, and turn our back on the Divines. Show us, O lord, how this may be prevented.\"\n"
"\n"
"Then a kingfisher flew into the chapel and landed on the altar before Greenward. It was a very large kingfisher, larger than any the lad had ever seen. It cocked its head, and then began to whistle and clack its beak. And Greenward seemed to hear speech among the whistles and clacks, words that said, \"The beasts come out of the Wild because they have forgotten your names, and believe you to be beasts like themselves, whom it is lawful to slay. Someone must go to the Wild and tell the beasts that he has a name, and the vanquished lands are forfeit to his claim.\" Then the kingfisher made a small mess, as birds will, and flew away. \n"
"\n"
"The lad bowed and said, \"I shall do this for my family, and the other families of the vanquished lands.\" He hugged his father, he kissed his mother, and he left the town and went back to the edge of the Wild. There he met a savage tiger, who made as if to pounce upon him, but the lad said, \"It is not lawful to pounce upon me, for I have a name, and am no beast. My name is Greenward, and I claim this land as vanquished. Return to the Wild and come here no more.\"\n"
"\n"
"And do you know what? The savage tiger did exactly that. And so did the ravening wolves, and the shambling bears, and the fierce trolls, and the wicked spriggans: all returned to the Wild and came to the vanquished lands no more. \n"
"\n"
"When this was done the lad hoped his work was over and he could return to his family, but it was not so. For always new beasts came from the Wild who had to be taught the boundaries. So the lad lived thereafter under the eaves of the wood and walked the edge of the wild, telling the beasts his name and turning them back. And our people called him the Viridian Sentinel. \n"
"\n"
"Eventually the Sentinel grew very old and felt that soon he might walk the borders no more. He began to worry. But a girl came to him and said she had been spoken to by a bird, and thereafter the two walked the border together. And when the Sentinel finally passed on and his name went with his soul to Aetherius, the girl became the new Viridian Sentinel, and the vanquished lands were still safe. \n"
"\n"
"So it has been ever after. And so it will always be."

"By Juno Procillus, Academy of Chorrol\n"
"\n"
"The following is the transcribed statement of a shaman of Druadach who named himself Uraccanach the Witchman:\n"
"\n"
"\"Like the fingers of your hand, like the clutch of the Hagraven, like the arrows to kill a bear, Five are the Aspects of Lord Hircine. You may meet any of the Five. All are true and right and death-in-the-woods. All are worthy of reverence. \n"
"\n"
"\"You may meet the Hunter, who is invoked as Alrabeg. He bears the Spear of Bitter Mercy. He comes here from the Hunting Grounds to hunt new prey, or he brings prey native to the Hunting Grounds, like the Unicorn, to hunt in new forests. If he brings not prey, then woe betide you who meet him, for he may dub you the Hare. Then you must flee as best you can, though you will not escape. \n"
"\n"
"\"You may meet the Manbeast, who is invoked as Storihbeg. He wears the Wolf Skull Totem and his growl is like a landslide in the Karth Gorge. He comes here to hunt with his children the Skinshifters, or to adopt new children and turn them pelt-side-out. His howl will freeze your inwards like a pond in Evening Star at midnight—you will see your death approach, but be unable to flee.\n"

"Let no man say before a witness that the Hunt has not been called, nor the Rites declared, nor the Ancient Offices observed.\n"
"\n"
"The Ritual of the Innocent Quarry, also called the Great Hunt, is an ancient rite drawing magical energy from the powerful magicka stream that engulfs this realm. The creators and times of the rituals are long forgotten. But followed properly, the rite brings great power and prestige to the Huntsman.\n"
"\n"
"The ritual pits the all-powerful Huntsmen and their Greater and Lesser Dogs against the pitiful and doomed Innocent Quarry, called by tradition the Hare, after the mortal creature of human hunts. At once, the Huntsman is transported by the exquisite thrill and glory of his might and dominion over his helpless prey, and at the same time touched by the tragic, noble, and ultimately futile plight of the Innocent Quarry. In the highest aesthetic realization of the ritual, the ecstatic rapture of the kill is balanced by the Huntsman's identification with the sadness and despair of the Innocent Quarry. As in pieces the body of the innocent Hare is torn, the Huntsman reflects on the tragic imbalances of power and the cruel injustices of the world.\n"
"\n"
"As the Hunt begins, the Lesser Dogs assemble before the green crystal reflections of the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry. Inside the Chapel, the Huntsmen, the Greater Dogs, and the Master of the Hunt perform the rites that initiate and sanctify the Huntsmen, the Hunt, and the Innocent Quarry. Then the Huntsman emerges from the Chapel, displays the Spear of Bitter Mercy, and recites the Offices of the Hunt. The Offices describe the laws and conditions of the four stages of the Hunt: the Drag, the Chase, the Call, and the View to the Kill.\n"
"\n"
"Stage One: The Drag, in which the Lesser Dogs drag the ground to flush out the Hare.\n"
"\n"
"Stage Two: The Chase, in which the Greater Hounds drive the Hare before them.\n"
"\n"
"Stage Three: The Call, in which the Greater Hounds trap the Hare and summon the Huntsmen for the kill.\n"
"\n"
"Stage Four: The View, in which the Huntsman makes the kill with the ritual Spear of Bitter Mercy, and calls upon the Master of the Hunt to view the kill by ringing the town bell. The Master of the Hunt then bestows the Bounty upon the Huntsman Bold who has wielded the Spear of Bitter Mercy in the kill. The Master of the Hunt also calls upon the Huntsman Bold to name the next Hare for the next Hunt (though the Huntsman Bold himself may not participate in the next Hunt).\n"
"\n"
"The Offices of the Hunt, which the Huntsmen, Master, and Hounds are solemnly sworn to honor, detail the practices and conditions of the Hunt. These practices and conditions, also known as the Law, strictly define all details of the Hunt, such as how many Hounds of each sort may participate, how the Spear of Bitter Mercy may be wielded, and so forth. In addition, the Law states that the Hare must have a genuine chance to escape the Hunt, no matter how slim. In practice, this condition has been defined as the availability of six keys which, if gathered together in the Temple of Daedric Rites, permit the Hare to teleport away from the Hunt, and so elude the Huntsman and his Spear. It is inconceivable, of course, that the Hare might actually discover the keys and escape, but the forms must be observed, and tampering with the keys or cheating the Hare of a genuine chance of finding or using the keys is a shameful and unforgivable betrayal of the Law of the Hunt."

"\n"
"세 번째 단계: 부르기. 요청, 큰 개들은 토끼를 함정에 빠지게 한 뒤, 죽이기 위해 사냥꾼들을 부른다.\n"

"\n"
"\"Knights of Saint Pelin; Evermore Guard; freeborn militia of Mournoth and Ephesus: soldiers of Bangkorai! Ever have we been the shield of High Rock, the first line of defense for the Breton Kingdoms against invaders from the east. Time and again the Bretons of Evermore and her surrounding regions have taken up arms to garrison Bangkorai Pass and turn away those who would pillage and plunder our homeland. In the year 874 of the First Era, when Warlord Thulgeg's army of Orcs and Goblins was driven from Hammerfell by the Redguards, we denied them passage through the Pass and forced them to flee northeast, trudging all the way through the Dragontail Mountains before they finally reached Orsinium. Not a single Goblin made its way through our pickets into our homeland.\n"
"\n"
"\"Then, in 1029, when the legions of Empress Hestra deposed King Styriche, the Vampire of Verkarth, he fled west at the head of his dreaded Gray Host, burning and killing as they came. But when his army of bat-men and wolves reached the Bangkorai Garrison, they broke like a wave on a rock. Hestra's legions caught and killed the survivors, and the Empress was so impressed that she honored High Rock with admission into the First Empire. \n"
"\n"
"\"When, after almost a thousand years under the Ruby Throne, the excesses of the Alessian Order forced High Rock to secede from the First Empire, the Monks of Cyrodiil decided not to let us go peaceably. In 2305, under Abbot-General Priscus Mactator, the Legions of Piety and Grace were sent to bring the Bretons back into the fold. Mactator's fanatics filled the Fallen Wastes from end to end, but they could not pass the Bangkorai Garrison, and after a five-month siege, with the pious turning on the graceful, the Abbot-General was forced to admit defeat and plod back to Cyrodiil in disgrace. \n"
"\n"
"\"Only once has the Garrison failed to protect High Rock: when Durcorach's Reachmen Horde poured down the south shore of the Bjoulsae, filtering through the Northwest Spine that had always protected us before. Then, Evermore was sacked, and the Garrison was taken from behind. But even then, we bought High Rock enough time that the Breton Kingdoms were able to muster their troops and eventually repulse Durcorach at Daggerfall.\n"
"\n"
"\"Today, invaders from the east threaten us once again, in the form of an Imperial Legion from Cyrodiil. But these are not the legendary warriors of an Empress Hestra, or the disciplined soldiers of an Emperor Reman: these are the degraded mercenaries of the Tharn usurpers. Indeed, this legion is even led by a cousin of that decadent and faithless family!\n"

"\"And who is this Magus-General Septima Tharn? What battles has she won, beyond bullying freeholders for their back taxes? What barrel-scrapings are these so-called 'legionaries' she brings to pollute our homeland with their heretical, Daedra-worshiping ways? \n"
"\n"
"\"I say they are scum, a desecration of the once-noble name 'Imperial Legion.' I say they are a rabble. And I say that, with us manning the walls, they shall not pass the Bangkorai Garrison! \n"

"\"What say you, Knights of Saint Pelin; Evermore Guard; freeborn militia of Mournoth and Ephesus—soldiers of Bangkorai! Will we betray the blood of our ancestors and allow enemies through the Pass? Never, I say! Not today, not tomorrow, not ever!\""

"Long ago, a man with seven sons and seven daughters lived in Bangkorai. Their home was in a deep and twisted cave at the edge of the woods.\n"
"\n"
"The surrounding forest was filled with all manner of creatures: bears, wolves, badgers, and deer. Though his family was large, they never knew hunger, for the animals were plentiful and easy prey.\n"

From the deer his children slew, the man took antlers to make an altar, and his wife braided hides into leather rugs to cover the dirt floor.\n"

"\"I am your faithful servant,\" said the man, groveling before his god.\n"

"This report on the city of Northpoint and its primary noble house, Dorell, was ordered directly by His Majesty High King Emeric and has been painstakingly researched. I, Chancellor Regina Troivois of the Department of Interior Affairs, personally oversaw this effort and verify the accuracy of the information contained herein.\n"
"\n"
"First, some history for context. Captain Yric Flowdys, an enterprising Breton trader operating the summer route of shipping from Daggerfall to Solitude, established Northpoint during the 9th century of the First Era. Though the shores here do not form an ideal harbor, Yric knew the deep waters approaching them could easily accommodate large vessels, and that the location along the trade route made for a perfect way station where traders could resupply, make repairs, or shelter through storms. He constructed the first docks at Northpoint, the best anchorage, and named the port after it.\n"
"\n"
"Soon after building the docks, Captain Flowdys oversaw the addition of a small walled keep and warehouse in the heights of Dore Elard, to the east of the growing port-of-call. Before long, the town bustled with activity, and Flowdys, realizing the success of his venture, took the name of the mountain as his new family name. He and his relatives continued to grow their maritime endeavors, as well as develop and invest in the port and surrounding lands, eventually leasing plots to farmers and establishing new sources of income. \n"
"\n"
"For most of the First Era, the family exemplified the type of active, entrepreneurial merchant princes that brought great prosperity to High Rock. In 1E 1029, the Dorells were granted a barony when the Empress Hestra joined High Rock to the First Empire. The fortunes of House Dorell, and of Northpoint, have waxed and waned with the flow of the northwest coastal trade ever since.\n"
"\n"
"In the 24th century the Dorells, having continued their rise in wealth and power, held the monarchy of Shornhelm for several generations. This distinction has colored the family's image of itself through subsequent centuries, and the Dorells regard themselves among Rivenspire's true elite even today. It also gave them a taste for political intrigue which, combined with their already-ambitious spirit, has made the house impossible to ignore. The current Baron of the House, Alard, wields significant power as one of the triumvirate of nobles who have ruled Rivenspire since the fall of Ranser. Along with the leaders of House Montclair and House Tamrith, Alard Dorell has pledged himself to the High King and hopes to one day earn the right to rule as the sole King of Shornhelm.\n"
"\n"
"In recent times, House Dorell excels as a maritime and mercantile power. They maintain a mansion in Shornhelm for the Baron and Baroness, keeping the house closely involved in the happenings of the court. The estate in Northpoint is left to other relatives, though oversight of its lands remains integral to the family's operations. At present the young but very capable Lord Ellic, son of Baron Alard, manages the family's holdings around Northpoint when his father is at court and serving on the triumverate.\n"
"\n"
"The Dorells are militaristic and politically savvy, and their mercantile traditions have forged a level of wealth rarely seen in Rivenspire circles. House Dorell has generated extensive ties with merchants in Solitude. This, they are quick to point out, has nothing to do with the sword rattling of politics. To Dorell, this is simply good business.\n"
"\n"
"From my study of the three noble houses of Rivenspire that form the ruling triumvirate, I recommend that you place little trust in House Montclair, and to be cautious in any interaction with them—their true loyalties are only to their own aspirations. House Dorell, on the other hand, while also ambitious, seems to possess a degree of honor and a love of country rarely exhibited by the Montclairs (who seem to be overly proud of their heritage to Ranser). House Tamrith, meanwhile, has always been loyal and a friend to Wayrest. However, the Countess is relatively new to her role as house leader and may not be ready to assume any greater responsibilities"

"By Lord Wylon, 39th Baron Montclair\n"
"\n"
"The Breton people of the Markwasten Moor and Shornhelm heights have a long and storied history, with much to be proud of: the Trammeling of the Giants in the time of legends; the Purge of the Wyrd-Hags in the Year of Sun's-Death (which restored Magnus to the skies of the Mundus); and the Charge of the Montclair Knights (often erroneously referred to as the Charge of the Shornhelm Knights) at the Battle of Glenumbria Moors. \n"
"\n"
"Through all this tumultuous history, the people of Rivenspire are fortunate to have been ably led, through times of terror and triumph, by the noble lords of the House of Montclair. \n"
"\n"
"It is true that the Barons of House Montclair have not always been selected by fate to also reign as King of Shornhelm. But the Montclairs count humility among their many virtues, and have often been willing to defer to pretenders with weaker claims to royalty in the interest of peace. That this humility has sometimes been tragically over-indulged was sadly proven in the case of my father—Phylgeon, 38th Baron Montclair. \n"
"\n"
"As all students of Breton history know, the greatest post-Reman monarch of Shornhelm was King Hurlburt, who led our army at the Battle of Granden Tor and ruled the North from 2E 522 until his death in 546. Hurlburt was of House Branquette, 21st Count of the Name, and had taken as his queen Countess Iphilia of Montclair. When King Hurlburt died his legitimate son, Prince Phylgeon, was only fourteen years of age, and though his inheritance was championed by House Montclair, Houses Branquette and Tamrith supported his elder half-brother, Prince Ranser, who had been born out of wedlock to a poor Tamrith cousin. (House Dorell, typically aloof, declined to endorse either candidate.) \n"
"\n"
"What is less well known is the behind-the-scenes maneuvering that led to Ranser being crowned King of Shornhelm rather than Phylgeon. The advisors of the young Baron Montclair (his mother had predeceased King Hurlburt by a mere two years) contended that he, as the legitimate son, was the proper heir to the throne—a claim further buttressed by language in a codicil to the famous \"Bretonnick Natalitie\" that declared \"Howse Mount Clayre\" the royal house of Shornhelm. The Council of the North met to consider the various claimants, but during their deliberations the Montclair advisors found that the Bretonnick codicil had gone missing, while Prince Ranser brought forth a suspiciously long-lost Direnni decree that named House Branquette their \"Breton Royal Delegates\" in Rivenspire. \n"
"\n"
"The vote of the Council was a narrow victory for Prince Ranser, thereafter King Ranser of Shornhelm. Some of Prince Phylgeon's advisors urged him to fight for the crown, but the young prince declined, preferring to become simply the Baron of Montclair. \n"
"\n"
"Oh, fateful humility! We all know where Phylgeon's deference led—to the tragic events of 566 and the insurrection against the First Daggerfall Covenant in what is known (to our shame) as Ranser's War. According to the standard histories, all the noble houses—Montclair, Tamrith, even Dorell—answered King Ranser's call to muster and marched behind his banner in his fatal war against High King Emeric and the South. What is not generally known is that Count Phylgeon of Montclair was uncertain of the rightness of Ranser's cause, and offered to both Kings Ranser and Emeric to serve as a peace envoy between the two sides. High King Emeric's reply has been lost to history, but Ranser's angry refusal is well known. Once again my father deferred to his elder half-brother, and the Montclair Knights joined Ranser's doomed army. \n"
"\n"
"In the immediate aftermath of King Ranser's fall, Rivenspire fell into chaos. The Crown of Shornhelm went missing during the Battle of Traitor's Tor, and the fateful \"Direnni decree\" that elevated Ranser to the throne has likewise not been seen since. The death of Ranser was the end of the line of House Branquette, and since then there has been no King of Shornhelm, Rivenspire having been jointly ruled by the triumvirate Council of the North. That body has tried, with the best of intentions, to keep peace and order in the northern counties, but nobody, if they were speaking honestly, would say the Council's efforts have sufficed. Shornhelm—and the North—need a King. \n"
"\n"
"And why shouldn't they have one? If I may speak frankly, setting aside, however regretfully, the traditional Montclair mantle of humility, then I must confess that I, Baron Wylon of Montclair, am certainly the legitimate heir to the throne of Shornhelm. My grandfather was King Hurlburt, and I descend from him in the direct and legitimate line of succession, a claim no one else in the North can make. (That also makes me the sole living heir to the domain of the Branquettes, much of which was unfairly parceled out to the Tamriths and Dorells, but no—humility, always humility!) \n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, at this critical juncture I am fortunate to be able to announce that the long-missing Bretonnick Codicil has been found by the Montclair house historian, the operative clause of which I shall quote here: \n"
"\n"
"\"… seeing all in order then in Sharn Helm and its Lands Contyguous, the most royale and high … (unintelligible) … appointeth in Perpetuitie sayde Howse Mount Clayre in rulership over … (unintelligible) … and Sharn Helm. So mote it bee.\"\n"

"For the royal eyes of the High King Emeric only! (He so loves it when I start these reports this way.)\n"
"\n"
"House Tamrith of Rivenspire has holdings primarily in the western half of that region, with numerous business interests that include agriculture, mercantiles, and commerce. Indeed, it was their thriving trade with the lands to the south that eventually led to strong ties with Stormhaven and the city of Wayrest.\n"
"\n"
"In many ways, the rivalry that marks the interplay of the three most prominent noble houses of Rivenspire (Tamrith, Dorell, and Montclair) dates back to the late period of the First Era, as each house established its reputation and its fortune and helped the region prosper. Of the three, Tamrith has the strongest tradition of piety and religious commitment, and the house has often called upon Arkay as its personal and most favored deity.\n"
"\n"
"As the High King is well aware, a good portion of his youth was spent in the company of two of Rivenspire's nobles—Baron Esmark Tamrith and Count Verandis Ravenwatch. And so it was with a heavy heart that the military might of Wayrest and its allies had to be turned against Rivenspire more than a decade ago. At the time, King Ranser of Shornhelm declared war upon Wayrest and forced his nobles to join him in his losing effort. Whatever their true feelings toward Wayrest, the noble houses of Rivenspire obeyed the call of their king and fielded troops against the High King.\n"
"\n"
"In short order, House Tamrith withdrew its support of King Ranser and petitioned for peace. House Dorell was quick to follow suit. Only House Ravenwatch, a relatively small concern compared to the other noble houses of Rivenspire, never took up arms. They remained neutral throughout the year-long conflict. House Montclair, meanwhile, supported King Ranser almost to the bitter end. They finally surrendered to the Wayrest alliance just before the battle that pushed Ranser's remaining forces back to the place now known as Traitor's Tor.\n"
"\n"
"In the aftermath of the conflict, Baron Tamrith emerged as a powerful force for peace and cooperation. It was his idea to form a ruling triumvirate to govern the region in the High King's name, and the leaders of all three noble houses pledged their loyalty to High King Emeric. The High King approved of the triumvirate, but also promised to select a new king of Shornhelm at the first opportunity. (This one reminds the High King that this promise has yet to be fulfilled.)\n"
"\n"
"Baron Esmark Tamrith married the daughter of House Elde, Janece, thus combining their fortunes and creating an even stronger political entity. The couple was blessed with two daughters, the pragmatic and thoughtful Eselde, and the strong and somewhat wilder Janeve. Four years ago, Eselde left Rivenspire to broaden her education and religious studies in Stormhaven, where she was a guest of the High King's court for the majority of that time. During the same period, young Janeve (against her father's and sister's wishes) joined the Shornhelm Guard.\n"
"\n"
"Eselde excelled in her studies, taking a particular interest in history, politics, diplomatic studies, and theology. She demonstrated a deep conviction in the teachings of Arkay and the Way of the Light, while also surpassing her contemporaries as a healer and champion of riddle contests. It was clear that she fully intended to prepare herself to eventually take on the mantle of leader of House Tamrith.\n"
"\n"
"Janeve likewise surpassed expectations. She quickly demonstrated amazing combat prowess, military strategy, and an ability to lead others in battle. She earned a number of rapid promotions, eventually becoming a Captain of the Guard. In addition to her role in the Shornhelm military, she also headed up the personal troops of House Tamrith. (For the record, in times of war or other emergencies, it is not uncommon for house troops to join with the city guard to form a single fighting force to defend the region.) If Janeve has a fault, it is her quick temper and love—some might say need—of constant action.\n"
"\n"
"It is with sad tidings that I report of the death of Baron Esmark Tamrith. He passed away just a few short months ago of natural causes. Eselde immediately left Stormhaven to return to Rivenspire and take up the mantle of house leader. Now, as Countess Eselde, she has taken her father's place as part of the ruling triumvirate of Rivenspire. So far, she has been performing admirably in the role, despite the constant disagreements with Baron Dorell. How she will interact with Baron Montclair has yet to be demonstrated, as the Baron has been absent from court these past few months, tending to the needs of his ailing wife.\n"

"Barring unforeseen circumstances, I see a bright future ahead for the newly appointed Countess of House Tamrith.\n"

"\n"
"In the distant past, the dark and foreboding pinnacle of stone known as the Doomcrag was a place of learning and worship for the Ayleid people. But in recent memory, the place has been known as a haunted peak beyond a treacherous pass of fog and shadow.\n"
"\n"
"Due to the current interest in the often ignored location, Countess Tamrith has asked me to chronicle a few of the legends concerning this forbidden place.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"One dark tale concerns the hero of House Dorell, Brianna the Bold, who traveled to the Shrouded Pass to chase down the bandit lord, Red Rob. Brianna and her troop of knights chased Red Rob all along the northern shore, intent on capturing him and bringing him to justice for his many crimes—including his most recent exploit, the pillaging of a Dorell cargo ship. Unfortunately for Red Rob, the House Baron of the period's daughter was traveling on the ship when Red Rob and his cohorts attacked it. For injuries and insults, she demanded the head of the brigand and dispatched Brianna the Bold to hunt him down.\n"
"\n"
"By the time Brianna reached the entrance to the Shrouded Pass, all of her knights had been killed or wounded. She was on her own. Luckily for her, Red Rob had not fared any better. He was alone when he plunged into the dense fog to avoid her. Not to be deterred, Brianna was true to her name and boldly charged in after him. It was the last time either Brianna or Red Rob were ever seen again.\n"
"\n"
"But locals claim that on clear, cold nights, when a thin, red mist decorates the jutting shard of rock, you can hear the clash of steel on steel as Brianna and Red Rob continue their epic struggle into eternity.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"Another popular, if somewhat disturbing, legend concerning the Doomcrag tells the tale of the spurned Ayleid lover who pines away at the very apex of the mountain. Rejected by a handsome butler in the service of a noble house, the spurned lover climbed to the top of the Doomcrag and refused to come down. Her friends and family tried everything to cheer her up and make her leave the tower. Distraught and sick at heart, she ignored every plea and word of comfort. And when her pain became unbearable, she leaped from the Doomcrag and crashed into the sea far below.\n"
"\n"
"That, however, was not the end of her sad story. People believe that to this very day, handsome travelers who wander too close to the Doomcrag risk attracting the attention of the spurned Ayleid. They say that her restless spirit swoops down and—pardon the wordplay—spirits away the hapless traveler, carrying him to the top of the mountain to keep him as a pet and plaything. Ultimately, however, even the most-patient captive does something to reject and spurn the Ayleid spirit. On lonely nights, or so the story goes, you can hear the intermingled screams as the Ayleid spirit once again hurls herself into the sea, carrying her latest lover with her to a watery grave.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"But perhaps the most common tale told about the Doomcrag describes the Death That Walks. This particular legend is more a cautionary tale than a scary story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. It says that any who attempt to climb the Shrouded Pass inevitably climb to their deaths. With every step, a year of life is lost. Depending on your age and relative level of health, death might overtake you after only a few steps up into the dense fog. Or, if you're particularly lucky, you might ascend all the way to the very top—into the rumored relic chamber—before the Death That Walks catches up with you.\n"
"\n"
"Whichever the case, every step brings with it a measure of pain and weakness as you march to your inevitable demise. This legend, more than any other, has kept the Doomcrag shrouded in mystery, for few have been brave enough to test the veracity of this story.\n"
"\n"
"Reveiwing my notes, I can see why Countess Tamrith was frightened of the Doomcrag when she was a young girl. If truth be told, even at my advanced age, these legends frighten me."

"By Doctor Nabeth al-Gilane, Khefrem Academy of Yokudan Heritage\n"
"\n"
"I scoffed, of course, when I heard the rumors. A lost colony of Redguards on the northern coast of High Rock? Patently absurd. But the rumors were so persistent, so consistent, that eventually I was moved to take a sabbatical from my pedagogic duties at the Academy and travel north to see for myself. \n"
"\n"
"And behold, by the tears of Morwha, it was so! All of the scholarly details will be found in my forthcoming paper \"Sevenfold Truths of the Tribe of the Herd-Mother,\" but I shall summarize the main points here, as I feel this tale is too wondrous to wait upon the slow march of scholarship. \n"
"\n"
"On the northwest coast of the High Rock region of Rivenspire, some leagues west of the city of Shornhelm, is a pastoral basin known as the Vale of Silverhoof. Abiding there, as they have for the past three thousand years, is a tribe of Redguards who go by the simple name of the Horsemen. \n"
"\n"
"How did they get there, and when, and why? Unfortunately the Horsemen have no written records, but their oral traditions are strong, and I have recorded those that have been passed down from one generation to the next. The elders of the tribe were generous with their time, particularly two named Muzar and Yalaida, and from their tales I have been able to piece together the following tentative history. \n"
"\n"
"The Horsemen originally came from Yokuda, of this there can be no doubt. Though they have become unavoidably \"Bretonized\" over the centuries by contact with the Nedic folk who surround them, they retain a number of Yokudan words in daily speech, all spoken with that drawl in the vowels we associate with the steppes of old Akos Kasaz. A few examples will suffice from their riding terminology: to tell a horse to turn left, the Horsemen say \"Netu;\" to turn right, \"Netu Hu;\" and to halt, they say \"Selim.\" Of course, \"netu\" is Old Yokudan for \"turn,\" while \"anselim\" means to stop or to cease. \n"
"\n"
"So the Horsemen are of Yokudan descent, most probably from the herding clans of northern Akos Kasaz. The elders of the tribe maintain detailed oral accounts of their genealogy, and from the number of generations they record, it is possible to date their arrival on the shores of Tamriel to the early sixth century of the First Era. This was a period of upheaval in High Rock, when the Direnni Hegemony was in its death throes and the Breton kingdoms were just establishing themselves, a time when a colony of determined settlers could find a niche and establish itself before it could be driven out or absorbed by the indigenes. And according to the tales I heard from Muzar and Yalaida, this is exactly what happened in the Vale of Silverhoof, nearly two centuries before the Ra Gada came to Hammerfell. \n"
"\n"
"Why the Horsemen came to this land is harder to determine, for on that subject their tales veer into the legendary or even mythical. Here I must speak about the tribe's unorthodox religious beliefs, for they are central to their traditions and identity. For the Horsemen do not worship any of the Old Yokudan gods as we know them, instead venerating a sort of divine animist spirit they call the Herd Mother. This equine entity acts as the tribe's guiding and protective deity; young Horsemen must commune with her on a vision journey they must partake by themselves that acts as a rite of passage to adulthood (similar to our own tradition of Walkabout). This \"Herd Mother\" is otherwise unknown to modern scholarship, but of course the vast majority of our cultural records were lost in the cataclysm that swallowed the Old Isles. \n"
"\n"
"The Horsemen's tradition is that the tribe left lost Yokuda in order to preserve their worship of this Herd Mother, which was somehow endangered in the Old Isles. Their stories describe the journey from Akos Kasaz in a flotilla of \"swimming horse-ships\" given them by the Herd Mother, in which they \"crossed seventeen seas\" before reaching Tamriel. We may discount this tale as somewhat fanciful, but the Horsemen claim to have brought their eponymous mounts with them from the Isles, and this I do not doubt. For to the eye of this connoisseur of horseflesh, the steeds of the Horsemen are unmistakably identical to that breed we call the Yokudan Charger, and could have come directly from the Aswala Stables in the Alik'r."

"\n"
"I have been tasked with learning everything that I can about the bloodfiends that have been appearing throughout Rivenspire of late. These creatures appear to be exactly the same as other bloodfiends we have examined in the past. But for all their similarities, they have one telling and significant difference—they appear at the beginning of the vampiric cycle instead of at the end. \n"
"\n"
"Instead of appearing at the end of an otherwise long and grueling vampiric gestation period, this process changes ordinary citizens into feral monsters in a frighteningly short amount of time. It's almost like a fevered blood affliction that burns through individuals at an alarming rate. While not everyone who comes in contact with the catalyst becomes afflicted, those who do either turn into a vampire (rarely) or quickly spiral into the frenzied madness that characterizes all bloodfiends (the most likely outcome).\n"
"\n"
"My investigations suggest that these bloodfiends have a connection to the Argonian Reezal-Jul and Lady Lleraya Montclair. The court magician of House Montclair and the daughter of Baron Wylon Montclair have been leading Montclair troops across Rivenspire—troops that include vampires. There have been rumors of a blood-curse, some sort of foul magic that allows Reezal-Jul and Lleraya to turn ordinary citizens into bloodfiends with nothing but a glance, a wave of a hand, and a few muttered words. Eyewitness reports have been confused, at best, and these claims have yet to be fully verified. \n"
"\n"
"As with other bloodfiends dealt with in the past, the Rivenspire bloodfiends are vampires that have gone insane. Their minds have degraded beyond recovery, and they attack anything that moves with no regard for their own wellbeing. They are feral, violent creatures driven by their carnal lust for bones and blood. This strain of the blood-curse runs its course at an alarmingly rapid pace. I have documented instances of citizens being afflicted and turning feral in mere moments. How Reezal-Jul and Lleraya came by this terrible power is unknown. What is known is that they seem to be Oblivion-bent on helping Baron Montclair conquer the entirety of Rivenspire.\n"
"\n"
"This unusual blood-curse notwithstanding, the bloodfiends operate as all others of their ilk. These wild, ferocious savages can and often do pass their affliction on to their victims. Anyone wounded or killed by a Rivenspire bloodfiend has a significant chance of becoming a bloodfiend, and in a remarkably short period of time. \n"
"\n"
"Until I can gather more information, I can only recommend one course of action concerning the bloodfiends of Rivenspire—they must be destroyed."

"[This bit of propaganda was produced for House Tamrith and distributed while Countess Eselde was in the south, studying with the Order of Arkay.]\n"
"\n"
"Once upon a time, in the realm of Cutcap, there was a mighty king named Rulthrub who ruled nobly and long. After many years King Rulthrub felt himself getting old, and started to think about what would happen to his realm after he was gone. Now this king was blessed with two sons, which normally would be a happy thing for an aging monarch, but in this case it was a problem. For the younger son who had been born of his queen, Prince Pigeon, was weak-willed and indifferent. In contrast the elder son, Prince Lancer, was bold and self-assured, and though his mother was of House Rithmat, the noblest in Cutcap, still Prince Lancer had undeniably been born out of wedlock.\n"
"\n"
"Now King Rulthrub was a wise king, and did not try to conceal that he favored his elder son, Prince Lancer, as he was clearly the prince most fit to rule. But nonetheless when the old king finally went to Aetherius, some people felt that the milksop Prince Pigeon should take the throne. I don't know whether these people were merely misguided, or had some other reason why they thought the rulership of Cutcap should be undermined. Fortunately wiser heads prevailed and Prince Lancer was elected King of Cutcap by the Council of Nobles.\n"
"\n"
"Shortly after Lancer's accession to the throne he met a mademoiselle named Lady Vespire at a ball and fell in love. The lovely and clever Vespire was a daughter of House Rithmat, and after a brief courtship King Lancer told his Council of Nobles that she would be his queen. However, Count Pigeon (the former prince) objected that this would not be proper as King Lancer's mother had been a Rithmat, and by the Law of Consanguinity the Lady Vespire was too close a relation for marriage. On this the rest of the council agreed, and King Lancer was persuaded to set the young lady aside. Upon hearing this news, Lady Vespire disappeared, said to have been carried off into the forests by a coterie of nixads, and though the king sent out search parties, his lost love was never found.\n"
"\n"
"In due course the council recommended, for the sake of the dynasty, that King Lancer marry the young and healthy Lady Ignort of House Dull, and this, heartbroken, he agreed to. Lancer and Ignort were married, and King Lancer settled down to do his kingly duty by his new queen. Within a few months it was announced that Queen Ignort had borne King Lancer a child. A Naming-Day festival was declared for the infant princess, and everyone important in the realm was invited.\n"
"\n"
"On the day of the celebration all the goodly and great of Cutcap came and laid presents at the foot of the cradle of Princess Arayelle, for thus she had been named. But at the end of the line came someone no one recognized: a dire Wyrd-Hag, hooded and cloaked, and bearing a darksome flower. Now, no Wyrd-Hags had been seen in Cutcap since the Year of Sun's-Death, but all feared her and none dared bar her passage. \n"
"\n"
"The Wyrd-Hag advanced to the princess' cradle, and when she came to its foot she threw back her hood and cried, \"Behold, King Lancer! It is I, Lady Vespire, now a Wyress of the Wyrd!\" The gaily-clad crowd fell back in horror, for the formerly pretty Lady Vespire now sported a large nose disfigured by unsightly warts. \"By some oversight you failed to invite me to your daughter's Naming Day, but I have come nonetheless. And look—I have brought the infant princess a present!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"What present is this?\" said King Lancer, all a-tremble. \"A darksome flower? I like not its look!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"That's no surprise, Your Majesty,\" said the Wyrd-Hag mockingly, \"for this is a Forsaken Rose, a blossom no one wants! I know what that is like, King Lancer—and so, by my curse, shall your daughter!\" The horrible Hag then dropped the misshapen bloom upon the baby and disappeared in a flash of fire and a cloud of evil-smelling smoke. \n"
"\n"
"So it came to pass: Princess Arayelle grew up beautiful as a rose, but cross-grained and petulant. But she was nonetheless a princess of the north, so when King Emetick of the South came looking for a bride, their troth was quickly plighted. \n"
"\n"
"But Count Pigeon had long made a habit of visiting the South, and was a boon companion of King Emetick. And he pointed out to the King of the South that Arayelle was cross-grained and petulant, and he might make a stronger match by marrying the Princess of Watchtower. In time Emetick agreed. He broke his match with Arayelle and promised himself to the Princess of Watchtower. \n"
"\n"
"King Lancer, however, did not take this lightly, and swore he would go to war upon the oath-breaking King of the South. And he made lawful war upon King Emetick, but at the Battle of the Tor, Lancer was betrayed by one of his own generals. King Lancer was slain, his crown and Princess Arayelle both disappeared, and ever since the Throne of Cutcap has stood empty. \n"
"\n"
"But some say that when King Lancer was born a twin sister likewise saw the light of the world, but was spirited away by a Wyrd-Hag to be raised in the forests. And this child, a daughter of both Rulthrub and Rithmat, herself bore a daughter who was brought back to her maternal family. And this daughter was named Countess Eselde. \n"
"\n"
"And if the truth were told, all would know that her real title should be Princess Eselde. And she, and no other, is the rightful heir to the Throne of Cutcup. However, that is a tale for her people to tell."

"The burial grounds of Westmark Moor, known to many as the Sanguine Barrows, have developed an unsavory reputation among locals over the course of their history. The nobles of Rivenspire have buried their departed beneath the gnarled trees here for as long as anyone alive today remembers, laying relatives to rest among centuries-old crypts that have borne witness to corruption, disputes, theft, and worse. \n"
"\n"
"Many prominent northern nobles inter their dead in Westmark's cold earth, including the Dorell, Tamrith, and Montclair families. Though some of these houses have produced Kings and Queens of Shornhelm, those deceased do not rest with their relatives here. Instead, they are transported to join the other monarchs of High Rock in the great cemetery of Cath Bedraud in Glenumbra, per long-standing tradition.\n"
"\n"
"Feuds between the houses over the titles to gravesites in the Sanguine Barrows are common. One incident in Mid Year of 2E 551 earned the burial grounds their unfortunate common name. As I recall, it so happened that the Tamrith and Montclair houses both suffered the loss of a family member on the same day. The houses' claims in the barrows bordered one another and had been a source of strife between them for many years. When both funeral processions arrived one morning on the same hill in front of the same gravesite (a highly desirable one with a view of the river), conflict was inevitable.\n"
"\n"
"The nobles quarreled for hours and sent servants back and forth for documents, titles, and maps with official claims laid out, but neither house could be convinced to step down. As sunset approached, patience was in short supply. The Montclairs and the Tamriths each blame the other, unsurprisingly, for hurling the insult that provoked the houses into drawing steel, and the Bloody Funeral (as it came to be called) that ensued left a black mark on each house's legacy in the eyes of Rivenspire's people.\n"
"\n"
"Looting and desecration are likewise common among the Sanguine Barrows. Though the responsibility of patrolling them belongs to the constabulary of Hoarfrost Downs, the lure of riches is sometimes enough to turn a protector into a criminal, or at least enough to turn his head and allow entry to the tombs. More than once, a King or Queen of Shornhelm has ordered a hanging to set an example against such behavior. \n"
"\n"
"Despite these harsh consequences, a new defacement or theft still seems to follow nearly every noble burial. In fact, it has only been a few years since the Tamriths were scandalized when an entire crypt was found empty one morning of everything—bodies and all. The thieves were never found, and as to why they'd take the bodies with their loot, well, we'd all prefer not to think of it.\n"
"\n"
"The Sanguine Barrows have seen more than their share of villainy and conflict throughout the years, and earned their name many times over. I sincerely hope that no more tales of violence or robbery shall need to be added to this record, and that the nobles still buried there may rest peacefully for ages to come."

"Wayrest is one of the most glorious cities of western Tamriel—sparkling in her contemporary beauty, lustrous by her past. She is prized above all cities in High Rock. No other city has contributed so much to the culture of the Bretons. The spirits of her genius children continue to haunt the streets. You can see them in the gabled roofs, grand boulevards, and aromatic marketplaces. The people of Wayrest have an instinctive appreciation of their past, but are not obsessed by it, as the people of Daggerfall seem to be. One feels that one is in a modern city when one visits Wayrest, but there is a magic in the air that could only come from centuries of civilization.\n"
"\n"
"It is difficult for historians to declare a certain date for the foundation of Wayrest. Where the Bjoulsae River feeds the Iliac Bay, a settlement of some variety has existed since at least 1E 800. The traders and fishermen of Wayrest were surrounded by hostile parties. The Orc capital Orsinium had grown like a weed to the north, and pirates and raiders crowded the islands to the west. There is no mystery to Wayrest's name. After what most travelers had to endure at the eastern end of the Iliac Bay, the little fishing village on the Bjoulsae was a welcome rest.\n"
"\n"
"Nowhere in the much-vaunted censuses of the Skyrim Occupation is Wayrest mentioned. In the Annals of Daggerfall, King Joile's letter to Gaiden Shinji of 1E 948 contains the following reference: \"The Orcs have been plaguing the Wayresters and impeding traffic to the heart of the land.\"\n"
"\n"
"Wayrest only truly bloomed after the razing of Orsinium in 1E 980. Hard-working traders and merchants were instrumental in forming a trade alliance, thus reducing pirate activity on the bay. A successful mercantile family, the Gardners, built a walled palace in town and, over time, allowed banks and other businesses within its walls. A Gardner, Farangel, was proclaimed king when Wayrest was granted the right to call itself a kingdom in 1E 1100.\n"
"\n"
"Although Wayrest was ruled by one family, the merchants continued to wield incredible power. Many economists have alleged that Wayrest's eternal wealth, despite her hardships, comes from this rare relationship between merchants and crown. The Gardner Dynasty was followed by the Cumberland Dynasty, but never has a king of Wayrest been deposed by revolution or assassination. Every king of Wayrest can trace his line back to a merchant prince of Wayrest. The merchants and king respect one another, and this relationship strengthens both.\n"
"\n"
"Wayrest has survived blights, droughts, plagues, piracy, invasions, and war with good humor and practicality. In 1E 2702, the entire population of the city was forced to move into the walled estate of the Gardners as protection against pirates, raiders, and the Thrassian plague. A less resourceful community would have withered, but the Wayresters have survived to enrich Tamriel generation after generation."

"웨이레스트는 오시니움이 파괴되는 1E 980에 가서야 부흥하게 된다. 열일하는 상인들과 무역상들이 무역 연합을 형성하는데 중요한 기반이 되었고, 일리악 만의 해적 활동을 감소시키게 된다.  성공한 상업 가문인 가드너 가문은 마을에 성벽으로 둘러싼 궁정을 짓고, 시간이 흘러 은행과 다른 사업들이 궁정 내에서 활개를 띄게 된다. 1E 1100, 가드너 가문의 파란젤은 웨이레스트가 왕국이 될 수있는 위치에 서게 되자 스스로 왕을 칭하게 된다.\n"

"There is nothing like the Direnni Tower anywhere in Skyrim, save for High Hrothgar itself. Unlike the great mountain, which is a thing of nature, the tower is a structure—but one not constructed by Men or Mer, if the legends speak true, but by the Aedra themselves.\n"
"\n"
"It rises, stark and sheer, from the high center of Balfiera Island in the Iliac Bay, where it has stood since the dawn of time itself. Adamantine Tower, it is called, for the unknown, ageless material from which it is built, and Tower Zero, as the edifice that predates all other buildings on Mundus.\n"
"\n"
"The Direnni High Elves have ruled Balfiera since the beginning of the First Era. In common parlance the tower bears their name, though they can claim only the construction of the more recent keep that clusters around the tower's base. (Who is responsible for delving the catacombs beneath the keep is a matter of debate with no definitive consensus.)\n"
"\n"
"I have not consulted with the High Elves of Alinor (who has?), but the noble Croiden, Elden Antiquariat of the Direnni, deigned to answer a few questions. According to him, the tower was erected in the Dawn Era when the gods met to decide the fate of Mundus. At its apex, Auri-El, the great god of the Aldmeri, slew the trickster Lorkhan, impaled his heart on an arrow and launched it across the world. The heart merely laughed and lived on.\n"
"\n"
"The Aedra then withdrew from the affairs of Mundus, leaving behind the tower for the Direnni to discover and take for their own. What secrets did they find there? What have they concealed to this day? Whatever the secrets may be, the Direnni didn't reveal them to this humble Nord architect. \n"
"\n"
"However, secrets there must be, for I took sight-and-angle measurements of the Direnni Tower from the eight points of the compass. According to my calculations, and given the known characteristics of all available materials, building an edifice of its proportions should not be possible."

"\n"
"'Twas in Menevia, dear, green Menevia, there dwelt a young Breton of family and name. He had inherited a patrimony, and thus needed to do nothing, as others were paid to do for him. And so he sat at his mullioned window and gazed out the diamond panes at the colors of the countryside as they changed with the light. And he dreamed away the day, until the colors darkened and he betook himself to bed, where he slumbered and dreamed in truth.\n"
"\n"
"Of what did he dream? He dreamed of his own land, but in colors more intense, more true, and more pure than in day. His Menevia of Dreams was more real than his Menevia of Waking, and he felt more alive when asleep than awake. Each day at his mullions, he looked and longed for a way to dream beyond dreams—a way to live in his Reverie-Menevia forever and forever.\n"
"\n"
"\"Reverie-Menevia,\" he said, and it was a prayer. \"Reverie-Menevia. Reverie-Menevia.\" A thousand, thousand times he uttered this prayer, and it changed like a dream to \" 'Ver'-Menevia, 'ver'-Menevia,\" and more and more it became less and less, until at last, \"Vaermina,\" he said, and, \"Vaermina,\" and,  \"Vaermina\" again.\n"
"\n"
"And to him she came in Dream-Form, Vaermina Herself, and called him Supernal Dreamer, and First Nightcaller, and named him Omen of a Hundred Prophecies. And when he awoke, he yet did dream, and spoke as in a dream, and called other dreamers to him, and to Reverie-Menevia.\n"

"\n"
"For several seasons I have been observing the Stonechewer Goblin tribe, recording their daily activities and becoming familiar with their customs and routines. Over time I have deliberately crept closer and closer to the limits of their tribal camp, occasionally showing myself briefly so the subjects would become used to my proximity. At one point a warrior out to relieve himself behind a tree stumbled upon my observation post, and when he grunted and drew his crude-but-serviceable short sword I thought my work had come to an untimely end. Luckily the tribal shaman was nearby, and he intervened on my behalf, speaking harshly to the warrior and knocking aside his sword. The shaman pointed at me and slowly rotated his hand near his head, which I assume is a Goblin gesture denoting acknowledgement of superior intellect. Who would have suspected these so-called primitives had such regard for scholarship?\n"
"\n"
"After that there were no more incidents of hostility, and the Goblins tolerated my presence, so long as I kept a respectful distance from their females and offspring. Occasionally a warrior would bark at me, but I simply replied by making the hand-rotating \"intelligence\" gesture next to my head, and the warrior would shrug and go back to his business.\n"
"\n"
"As so little is known about the religious practices of the Goblin race, I decided to make the shaman of the tribe my particular study. The symbol of his office was a bone rod, probably a femur, with a small skull affixed to the end—possibly an infant's. This skull was ornamented with an assortment of feathers, spines, and animal claws, and filled with something like nut-hulls, for it rattled loudly when shaken. The shaman would shake this holy symbol forcefully when summoning his congregation to sacred rituals, or when the females were not bringing him food or drink rapidly enough.\n"
"\n"
"At particularly important rituals the shaman would touch the symbol to his heart, then his head, then point it to the sky and call out, \"Muluk!\" At first I found this confusing, given the similarity of \"muluk\" to the Goblin words \"muulk,\" which they use when chastising their durzogs or children, or \"mluku,\" the term for fecal matter. But gradually I learned to differentiate, and one day I realized that by crying \"Muluk!\" the shaman must be invoking the god of the Goblins. \n"
"\n"
"And then it struck me: \"Muluk\" is not really much different from \"Mauloch.\" Could the god of the Goblins and the god of the Orcs be one and the same? \n"
"\n"
"This is the kind of discovery that could win me tenure at the College of Wayrest! I must get independent confirmation of this revelation. But how?"

"\n"
"That Men and Mer can interbreed has been known since the first humans began arriving on the shores of Tamriel in the middle of the Merethic Era. However, broad intermingling of Elves and humans only occurred in the far northwest of the continent, giving rise to the race of Men known as the Bretons. Given the history of conflict between humans and the children of Aldmeris elsewhere in Tamriel, how and why did this intermingling occur in High Rock? \n"
"\n"
"The answer lies in the peculiar (for Elves) culture of Clan Direnni, the once-dominant Mer of northwest Tamriel. In contrast to the Ayleids of Cyrodiil, who brutally enslaved any humans they came into contact with, the Direnni simply conquered their local Nedes and then ruled them as a caste of nobility. The aristocratic Elves established a system of feudal vassalage over their human subjects, with rights and privileges that included the \"Perquisite of Coition\" with any human they desired. Sex with attractive Nedes was considered casual recreation, and Direnni nobles competed to have stables of the most desirable human subjects. \n"
"\n"
"The inevitable Half-Elven offspring from these liaisons were not adopted into the families of their Direnni parents, being considered sub-Mer, but were nonetheless often given privileged positions among the subject Nedes. Over time, this led to the establishment of a recognized caste of mixed-blood humans, who were given the name \"Bretons\" (from the Ehlnofex \"beratu,\" or \"half\"). The Breton caste was only allowed to marry humans, so over time their Elven blood became more diluted, and the Nedic appearance predominated. \n"
"\n"
"Though they wielded great power for a time in the First Era, even then the Elves of Clan Direnni were never numerous, and as their geographical hegemony expanded administration and rulership was increasingly handed off to the Breton caste. After defeating the invading Alessian Horde in 1E 482 Clan Direnni was scattered and effectively exhausted. As the Elves retreated to central High Rock, then finally Balfiera Isle, the Bretons stepped easily into their shoes, assuming the feudal hierarchy established by the Direnni and simply replacing them with their own noble families. \n"
"\n"
"The Breton nobles, who had been forced to differentiate themselves from the Direnni part of their heritage, justified their new ascension by distancing themselves from Elves and everything Elven—ironically so, as the Elven blood ran strongest in the older noble families. The Direnni were increasingly vilified by their former vassals, and the island clan became ever more insular and isolationist. However, they were still known as powerful magicians, and they were strong enough to repel an attempted Redguard invasion in 1E 907.\n"
"\n"
"The Bretons continued redefining themselves, inventing a myth of a history of noble resistance to Direnni rule, and developing a thriving merchant class that began trading around the coasts of Tamriel. By the time the Empress Hestra and her legions arrived at Bangkorai Pass in 1E 1029, they were ready to join the Empire of Men and embrace the Eight Divines. Under the Remans, High Rock was possibly the most stable and prosperous province in the Second Empire. \n"
"\n"
"Which brings us back to the (deliberately provocative) question of our title: are the Bretons then mongrels, or paragons? The answer, of course, is both (though if you call a Breton a mongrel, he is liable to feed you an inch or two of steel). The passionate race of Bretons embodies the strengths of both Men and Mer—as well as their flaws."

"\n"
"The Breton passion for feudal hierarchy pervades every aspect of High Rock society, from the lowliest peasant farmer to the High King in Wayrest. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the curious phenomenon of the Breton knightly orders. \n"
"\n"
"Here in Hammerfell, we Redguards sensibly award equal citizenship to every man or woman who knows which end of the sword to grasp. Oh, we have our governing class, of course, as civilization must be ordered and maintained, but below this aristocracy there are few distinctions. \n"
"\n"
"Not so in High Rock, where everyone is aware of their degree of nobility, which is invariably traced back to those Breton families who led the region's liberation from the overlordship of the Direnni Elves. High Rock cultural history is founded on tales of the noble and chivalrous \"Breton Knights\" who flung off the yoke of their Elven masters. After these knights drove the Direnni back to Balfiera Island, they founded the knightly orders to carry on the tradition of nobles-in-arms, and to ensure that High Rock would have able and ready defenders in times of trouble. \n"
"\n"
"So the stories go, at least. Today, every petty kingdom and duchy in High Rock has its own knightly order, with traditions that supposedly date back to the glory days of the Breton Liberation. The Knights of the Dragon in Daggerfall, the Knights of the Flame in Alcaire, the Order of Saint Pelin in Evermore—the list goes on and on. \n"
"\n"
"And what, nowadays, do these knightly orders do to justify their gleaming greatswords and shining mail? If we look beyond the banners and pageantry, we find that the chivalric orders fulfill two main purposes in High Rock society. \n"
"\n"
"First, they provide an acceptably \"noble\" calling for the excess sons and daughters of the aristocracy. Over time, as trade has made High Rock prosperous, the profession of merchant has become an accepted alternative to feudal lordship for the children of the nobility, but frankly, not every baron's son has a head for numbers and negotiation. For these spare heirs, there's always a membership available in the local knightly order. \n"
"\n"
"Second, the bestowal of a knighthood on a lower-class man or woman is a convenient way to reward outstanding contributions to society (or to the elevating lord), and confers a measure of that nobility so prized in Breton society. Where the commoner is rewarded for achievements other than in conflict—and this is the case in the majority of knighthoods—the membership in the local knightly order is only nominal, and the new sir or dame is not expected to take up sword and shield. However, if their achievements were in the all-important realm of trade, the new \"merchant knight\" is expected to contribute heavily and regularly to the order's financial maintenance. \n"
"\n"
"So if you're visiting Wayrest or Evermore on a mission of diplomacy or trade, don't be surprised if the head of a shipping company is introduced as Sir Doric, or the owner of a string of hostels is called Dame Lizabette. You're simply meeting one of the fabled Breton Knights of High Rock."

"Chapter One: Durak's Early Years\n"
"\n"
"Though Abbot Durak is our spiritual leader, he has never been comfortable with the title. Old Master Ugbak once said that relates to his upbringing in the ruins of Orsinium. Anyone can see that Durak is small for an Orc, and one could speculate that his brothers' bullying led him to pursue a mystical path, one unusual for Orcs.\n"
"\n"
"As Ugbak tells it, Durak's story begins in Orsinium, where his lot was hard and lonely. Durak's life changed when he first heard whispers in the night—whispers from the Daedric Prince Azura. Azura said Durak would accomplish a great task: he would come to Stormhaven and found an order of worshipers in her name. These \"Spirit Wardens\" would prepare for a time of chaos, when Stormhaven's people would suffer from a madness of nightmares.\n"
"\n"
"Durak knew better than to share these whispers with his brothers. He already faced ridicule for his study of magic and lack of physical prowess. Soon after, he left his home in Orsinium and struck out on the long journey to Stormhaven, carrying nothing more than his staff and the clothes on his back.\n"
"\n"
"Durak found his way to Stormhaven, but he had no idea how he was to found this order of \"spirit wardens\" or where they would live. Soon he despaired. One night, as he took shelter beneath the Weeping Giant, the whispers came again. The silken voice of Azura spoke of a path hidden in the hills west of Moonlit Maw. At its top, Durak found an ancient abbey, abandoned and overgrown. This, he knew, would be the home of the spirit wardens—and so it became our temple to Azura.\n"
"\n"
"Under Durak's leadership, we are prepared for Vaermina's plague of dreams. We were founded to protect Stormhaven from its nightmares, and we will do so to our dying breaths."

"Once, during the Alessian Reforms, Ryan Direnni stood up to the entire Empire. His Breton Legions, armed and commanded by Direnni Elves, controlled all the land as far east as Markarth and Elinhir. The Orc-hold of Orsinium has been sacked many times, but we Direnni sacked it first. \n"
"\n"
"Once, at the Battle of Glenumbria Moors, Aiden Direnni's vastly outnumbered troops routed the entire Alessian Horde, then chased them back to Cyrodiil. \n"
"\n"
"Once, before Corvus Direnni codified the rules of Conjuration, every summoning of even a minor Daedra was an act to be feared and avoided. \n"
"\n"
"Once, Peregrine Direnni drove an entire Ra Gada flotilla back to Sentinel by merging her very will with the waves of the Iliac Bay. \n"
"\n"
"Once, in a single day, Pelladil Direnni built Blackrose Prison from the scattered rubble of Lilmothiit ruins by summoning an army of Stone Atronachs. \n"
"\n"
"Yes, we were great once. But no matter what our individual achievements, every Direnni since Cygnus has been eaten from within by failure. \n"
"\n"
"Because we cannot solve the mystery of the Zero Stone, and use it to open the Argent Aperture which it wards. \n"
"\n"
"At maturity, every Direnni of high blood is brought into the Tower, conducted to the Foundation Vault, and shown the Zero Stone. We are allowed to touch it—once—so as to feel the transcendent mystical power that courses through it, a power we have never been able to tap. And we are shown the Argent Aperture in the adjacent metallic wall, that door with its lock of thirteen slowly counter-rotating rings, a portal we have never been able to open. \n"
"\n"
"And we console ourselves that if we Direnni have never been able to siphon the Stone or unlock the Aperture, well then certainly, neither could anyone else. We return to the world above, and we do something spectacular—so we will not have to face our failure. \n"
"\n"
"But once, as our lives near their ends, each of us gathers together all our knowledge, the fruits of all our achievements, and once more makes that descent to the Foundation Vault. To try it. Just once. \n"
"\n"
"Most are found within a day or two, dead and horribly distorted. Some, like my darling Heron, live on though terribly disfigured, too brain-blasted to understand what has happened to them. \n"
"\n"
"Me? I keep to our chambers in the Tourmaline Steeple, caring for Heron by day, and translating Ayleid tomes in the library by night. And it's a good enough life, too. \n"
"\n"
"Though sometimes, when working on an ancient grimoire or librus magus I question whether the arcane writings of our long-lost cousins are not better left a mystery. \n"
"\n"
"But then I think, is not all knowledge useful for something? And I think, what might this knowledge be useful for? \n"
"\n"
"And I think I might take that long walk downstairs. \n"
"\n"
"Just once."

"\n"
"As the official Mages Guild representative to the Lion Guard's efforts to stop the Reachmage known only as Angof the Gravesinger, I have decided to record my findings and speculations in case anything untoward happens to me while I'm out in the field. Who knew that the work of the Mages Guild could be so dangerous or so exciting? Anyway, this is accurate and up to date as of the time that I write this. Anything that turns out to be proven false or revealed at a later date I'll have to deal with in a later volume. Unless I can devise a spell that automatically updates my writing—no, no, I need to focus on one thing at a time!\n"
"\n"
"Angof has a number of associates helping him to complete his plans. I think he calls them \"Minions.\" Let's review the ones I suspect to be working with this vile necromancer.\n"
"\n"
"Faolchu, who seems to be associated with were-creatures and has launched an assault on Camlorn, appears to me to be following the orders of a more-powerful individual. I believe that individual to be Angof, but I have no proof of this connection as yet.\n"
"\n"
"The Bloodthorn Cult obviously has ties to Angof. Whether he leads the cult or is simply a member I haven't yet determined, but I'm positive that the two are connected. The cultists scour the land for relics and items of power, and they seem to count a large number of necromancers as part of their order. I wouldn't be surprised if they had ties to some Daedric Prince or other. Molag Bal, if I had to hazard a guess. \n"
"\n"
"Daedra, too, appear to be arrows in Angof's quiver. He casts them out into the world as a farmer throws seeds into the wind. I'm sure there are more of Angof's minions hiding in plain sight, but anything else I put forth at this point would be beyond pure speculation. Instead, let me turn to what I have discovered about the Reachmage himself.\n"
"\n"
"First, he seems to be poisoning the land in some way. The vile vines that grow wherever he has passed demonstrate how his foul magic pollutes the countryside. His very name—Gravesinger—speaks to his fascination and fluency with death magic. Death and decay are his domains, and he seeks power over life and death.\n"
"\n"
"His followers consider him a strong and persuasive leader. Many of them would literally die to please him. Such devotion isn't healthy, and I find it more than a little scary that someone could have such an effect on people.\n"
"\n"
"Angof seeks to cause as much chaos and mayhem as possible. Beyond that, I'm not sure of his ultimate motives. Has he come to Glenumbra to conquer us or destroy us? And in the end, does that distinction even matter? All I know is, we have to find a way to stop him. We have to!\n"
"\n"
"Well, I'll have to pick this up again at a later date. Now I have to head out and meet up with the Lion Guard at their redoubt near Cath Bedraud. Let's see if I can apply the knowledge that I've gathered to the task at hand."

"Orcs revere Mauloch as the First Orc, and live by the Code of Mauloch, which dictates such matters as honor and vengeance.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Code of Mauloch\n"
"\n"
"The Code is more often tacit than explicit, but includes the following:\n"
"\n"
"— Respect for forging and blacksmithing.\n"
"— The traditional roles of a clan's chief and his wives.\n"
"— The tradition of selection of a new chief through challenge and combat.\n"
"— The custom that one who commits a crime must pay \"Blood Price\" to the victim (or victim's relatives).\n"

"\n"

"The Eight:\n"
"\n"
"Akatosh (Dragon God of Time):\n"
"Akatosh is the chief deity of the Eight Divines (the major religious cult of Cyrodiil and its provinces) and one of two deities found in every Tamrielic religion (the other is Lorkhan). He is generally considered to be the first of the gods to form in the Beginning Place. After his establishment, other spirits found the process of being easier, and the various pantheons of the world emerged. He embodies the qualities of endurance, invincibility, and everlasting legitimacy.\n"
"\n"
"Kynareth (Goddess of Air):\n"
"Kynareth is a member of the Eight Divines, the strongest of the Sky spirits, patron of sailors and travelers. In some legends, she is the first to agree to Lorkhan's plan to invent the mortal plane, and she provides the space for its creation in the void. She is also associated with rain, a phenomenon said not to occur before the removal of Lorkhan's divine spark.\n"
"\n"
"Julianos (God of Wisdom and Logic):\n"
"Often associated with Jhunal, the Nord father of language and mathematics, Julianos is the god of literature, law, history, and contradiction, and the favorite deity of most Breton mages.\n"
"\n"
"Dibella (Goddess of Beauty):\n"
"Popular god of the Eight Divines, Dibella has nearly a dozen different cults, some devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction.\n"
"\n"
"Arkay (God of the Cycle of Life and Death):\n"
"Member of the Eight Divines pantheon and popular elsewhere, as well. Arkay is often more important in those cultures where his father, Akatosh, is either less related to time or where his time aspects are difficult to comprehend by the common folk. He is the god of burials and funeral rites, and is sometimes associated with the seasons. His priests are staunch opponents of necromancy and all forms of the undead. It is said that Arkay did not exist before the world was created by the gods under Lorkhan's supervision/urging/trickery. Therefore, he is sometimes called the Mortals' God.\n"
"\n"
"Zenithar (God of Work and Commerce, Trader God):\n"
"Member of the Eight Divines, Zenithar is understandably associated with the Bosmeri Z'en. In High Rock, however, he is a far more cultivated god of merchants, artisans, and the middle nobility. His worshipers say, despite his mysterious origins, Zenithar is the god \"that will always win.\"\n"
"\n"
"Mara (Goddess of Love):\n"
"Nearly universal goddess. Her origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess; in High Rock, she is the Mother-Goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the \"Anuad,\" the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. For the Bretons, she is married to Akatosh.\n"
"\n"
"Stendarr (God of Mercy):\n"
"God of the Eight Divines, Stendarr has evolved from his Nord origins into a deity of compassion, or sometimes, righteous rule. Stendarr is the patron of magistrates, rulers, and knights errant.\n"
"\n"
"Additional Deities with Significant Breton Cults:\n"
"\n"
"Magnus (Magus):\n"
"The god of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the last second, though it cost him dearly. What remains of him is felt and controlled by mortals as magic. One story says that, while the idea was thought up by Lorkhan, it was Magnus who created the schematics and diagrams needed to construct the mortal plane. He is sometimes represented by a golden eye, an astrolabe, a telescope, or more commonly, a staff. Legends say he can inhabit the bodies of powerful magicians and lend them his power.\n"
"\n"
"Y'ffre (God of the Forest):\n"
"While Akatosh Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, Y'ffre is revered as the spirit of \"the now.\" According to the Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane, everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the Ehlnofey, or \"Earth Bones.\" After the laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it.\n"
"\n"
"Sheor (Bad Man):\n"
"In High Rock, the Bad Man is the source of all strife. He seems to have started as the god of crop failure, but most modern theologians agree that he is a demonized version of the Nordic Shor or Aldmeri Lorkhan, born during the dark years after the fall of Saarthal.\n"
"\n"
"Phynaster:\n"
"Hero-god who taught the Altmer how to naturally live another hundred years by using a shorter walking stride. Patron deity and \"teacher\" of the Direnni. Often worshiped by those Breton mages who emphasize their Elven blood."

"\n"
"키나레스 (공기의 여신)\n"
"키나레스는 여덟 디바인의 일원이며, 하늘을 맡은 영혼 중 가장 강력하다. 또한 선원과 여행자의 수호자이며, 전설에 따르면 필멸자의 차원을 만드려는 로칸의 계획에 가장 먼저 동의하고, 공허 속에 차원을 만들 수 있는 공간을 제공했다. 그녀는 비와도 관련되어 있다고 하는데 이는 로칸의 신성이 사라지기 전에는 없었다고 한다.\n"
"\n"
"줄리아노스 (지혜와 논리의 신)\n"
"노르드의 언어와 수학의 아버지인 주날과 종종 관련되는 줄리아노스는 문학, 법률, 역사, 모순의 신이며, 브레튼 마법사들이 가장 좋아하는 신이다. \n"
"\n"
"디벨라 (미의 여신)\n"
"여덟 디바인의 일원으로 인기 있는 여신이다. 여성을 존중하는 것, 예술가와 미학에 관한 것, 관능에 대한 것등 다양한 분파가 존재한다.\n"
"\n"
"아케이 (생사의 순환을 주관하는 신)\n"
"여덟 디바인의 일원으로 다른 곳에서도 인기가 높다. 아케이는 시간과 관련이 적거나 시간에 대한 개념이 일반적이지 않은 곳에서, 그의 아버지인 아카토쉬 보다 더 중요하게 여겨진다. 매장과 장례의 신이며, 종종 계절과도 관련이 있다. 아케이 성직자들은 네크로맨서와 언데드에게 매우 적대적이다. 아케이는 로칸의 지도/재촉/속임수로 신들에 의해 세계가 만들어지기 전에는 존재하지 않았기 때문에 때때로 필멸자들의 신이라 불리기도 한다. \n"
"\n"
"제니타르 (노동과 상업의 신)\n"
"신성한 여덟의 일원으로 보통 보스머들과 연관되어 지는 경우가 허다한데, 하이 락에서는 상인, 예술 그리고 중산층 계급의 신으로 알려져 있다. 제니타르의 신자들이 말하기를, 그의 불분명한 기원에도 불구하고 제니타르를 항상 행운을 가져다 주는 신이라고 한다.\n"
"\n"
"마라 (사랑의 여신)\n"
"거의 모두가 알고 있는 여신이며, 신화의 시대에 풍요의 여신이자 하이락의 어머니 신으로서 숭배받기 시작했다. 그녀는 이따금 창조를 낳은 우주의 여신인 \"아누아드\"의 니르와 관련되기도 한다. 브레튼은 그녀가 아카토쉬와 결혼했다고 생각한다.\n"
"\n"
"스텐다르 (자비의 신)\n"
"여덟 디바인의 신인 스텐다르는 원래 노드들이 섬기던 연민, 때로는 정직한 규칙의 신이었다. 스텐다르는 재판관, 지배자, 그리고 협객들의 후원자이다.\n"
"\n"
"브레튼 문화에서 중요한 의미를 가지는 다른 신들:\n"
"\n"
"마그누스 (마법사)\n"
"마법의 신 마그누스는 최후의 순간에 세상의 창조를 그만두었지만, 커다란 대가를 치루었다. 그가 남긴 것은 필멸자들에게 마법으로써 느껴지며 통제된다. 한 이야기에 따르면, 필멸자의 차원을 창조하자는 생각은 로칸에게서 나왔지만,  그 건설에 필요한 도식과 도표를 만든 것은 마그누스라고 한다. 그는 종종 황금빛 눈, 천문 관측 기구, 망원경, 그리고 더 일반적으로는, 지팡이와 함께 표현된다. 전설에 의하면 그는 강력한 마법사들의 몸에 깃들 수 있으며 그들에게 자신의 힘을 빌려준다고 한다.\n"
"\n"
"이프레 (숲의 신)\n"
"시간의 드래곤 아카토쉬가 신들의 왕인데 비해, 이프레는 \"바로 지금\"의 영혼으로써 존경받는다. 엘프들에 따르면, 필멸자의 차원이 창조된 후에는 모든 것이 혼돈이었다. 최초의 필멸자들이 식물과 동물로 변했다가 돌아오기를 계속한 것이다. 그러자 이프레는 자기 자신을 최초의 엘노페이, 혹은 \"Earth Bones\"로 변화시켰다. 자연의 법칙이 성립된 후, 필멸자들은 새로운 세상에서 안정적인 외관을 얻을 수 있었다. 그들이 드디어 그것을 이해할 수 있게 되었기 때문이다.\n"
"\n"
"쉐오어 (사악한 자)\n"
"하이 락에서 사악한 자는 모든 불화의 원인이다. 그는 처음에는 흉작의 신으로 여겨진 것으로 보였으나, 현대의 신학자들은 대부분 그가 사아쌀의 함락 이후의 어두운 시대 동안 악마로서 묘사된 노드의 쇼어나 알드머의 로칸이라는 사실에 동의한다. \n"
"\n"
"파이나스터\n"
"알트머에게 더 짧은 걸음걸이를 사용하여 자연스럽게 또 다른 백년을 사는 법을 가르친 영웅 신이다. 디레니의 수호신이자 \"스승\"이기도 하다. 종종 자신들의 엘프 혈통을 강조하는 브레튼 마법사들에게 숭배받는다."

History has mislabeled them beastfolk, related to the Goblin races, but the Orcs are actually the children of Trinimac, strongest of the Altmeri ancestor spirits. When Trinimac was eaten by the Daedric Prince Boethiah, and transformed in that foul god's insides, the Orcs were transformed as well.

Of old he was Trinimac, the champion of the High Elven pantheon, in some places more popular than Auri-El, who protected them against enemies without and within. When Trinimac and his followers attempted to halt the Velothi dissident movement, Boethiah ate him. Trinimac's body and spirit were corrupted, and he emerged as Malacath. His followers were likewise changed for the worse. Despised by everyone, especially the inviolate Auri-El, they quickly fled to the northern wastes, near Saarthal. They fought Nords and Chimer for a place in the world, but did not get much. In Skyrim, Malacath is called Orkey, or Old Knocker, and his battles with Ysmir are legendary.\n"

Indeed, the kings of the Covenant take the Remans as their model, claiming to be the spiritual heirs of the Second Empire.\n"
"\n"
"The Daggerfall Covenant was born in 2E 542, when the kings of High Rock allied to repulse an invasion by a horde of Reachmen under the command of Durcorach, \"the Black Drake.\" Howling out of the eastern mountains, the Reach barbarians razed Evermore, besieged Wayrest, sacked Camlorn, and marched as far as the gates of Daggerfall before the Bretons finally stopped them. In the wake of Durcorach's defeat, the kings of Daggerfall, Wayrest, Camlorn, Evermore, and Shornhelm swore the so-called \"first\" Daggerfall Covenant, a solemn oath to defend each other's kingdoms and stand as one against all foreign foes.\n"
"\n"
"High Rock prospered as the Bretons rebuilt, especially after 2E 561, when miners near Wayrest made the biggest orichalcum strike in recorded history. Emeric, Earl of the domain of Cumberland, the site of the mines, proposed to use the resulting wealth to enhance Wayrest's fleet and improve trade throughout High Rock. King Gardner of Wayrest granted his approval, but before the fleet was completed, the dreaded Knahaten Flu swept through Wayrest and killed the entire Gardner royal household. Earl Emeric was elevated to the throne and House Cumberland became the second royal dynasty of Wayrest.\n"
"\n"
"The new King Emeric of Wayrest had been courting the daughter of King Ranser of Shornhelm, but in 2E 566 he married Princess Maraya of Sentinel. This nearly brought down the first Covenant when Ranser, who felt betrayed, launched a surprise attack on Wayrest. The kings of Camlorn, Evermore, and Daggerfall all sided with Wayrest, and Emeric's superior diplomacy brought the armies of Sentinel into the fray to protect Emeric's queen. Furthermore, Emeric reached out to a great clan of Orcs in Wrothgar and offered them Orsinium in return for aid. Shornhelm was defeated and the Covenant was reborn: not as a mere Breton defensive pact, but as a new, multinational alliance.\n"
"\n"
"The conclave that negotiated the alliance lasted for months, with argument and debate at every turn. The final result was the child of King Emeric's vision, made manifest in dozens of compromises and carefully negotiated provisions. Freedom of trade was guaranteed throughout the region, and over the objections of the nobles of Rivenspire and the Crown Redguards of Alik'r, the Orcs were accepted as full members of the alliance. Eventually, all the city-states of northwest Tamriel swore fealty to the Covenant's Royal Council, presided over by High King Emeric. As the architect of the alliance, he claimed supreme leadership.\n"
"\n"
"So this is the modern Daggerfall Covenant, an alliance of the Redguards of northern Hammerfell, under King Fahara'jad; the Orcs of the mountainous northeast, under King Kurog of Orsinium; with the Breton King Emeric of High Rock presiding from his palace in Wayrest. At its best, it is a noble alliance of honorable and chivalrous peoples, representing all the best aspects of the First and Second Empires. And from this solid foundation, perhaps a third, even mightier Empire shall arise, providing all the peoples of Tamriel the benefits of mutual respect, vigorous trade, and reverence for the Divines."

"Rejoice, peoples of northwest Tamriel! Though the rest of Nirn is afflicted by war, madness, and Daedric horror, the glory and honor of the Reman Empire lives on in the Daggerfall Covenant. We remain true to the primacy of trade, the principles of freedom, and worship of the Divines.\n"
"\n"
"In the face of a world of enemies, the trade powers of the Iliac Bay have formed a powerful alliance. High Rock, Hammerfell, and Orsinium stand as one, united under the rule of the High King in Wayrest. Orc and Breton craftsmanship make the alliance an economic powerhouse, and the military strength of the Orcs and Redguards make us a force to be reckoned with. Our kings join our people in longing for the return of a Tamrielic Empire, along with the economic prosperity that goes with it. There is only one way to make sure the right Emperor rules once more from the Imperial City: we must attend to it ourselves.\n"
"\n"
"The current so-called \"Empire of Cyrodiil\" is a sham, a twisted mockery of Reman's glorious Second Empire. The charlatans who sit on the Ruby Throne openly mock the Divines and court the Lords of Oblivion, the Enemies of Man. Even the once-promising Emperor Varen fell victim to Daedric corruption, his reforms swept away by the puppet-masters of the Daedric Cabal.\n"
"\n"
"The Daggerfall Covenant is the only true heir to the principles of the Second Empire. In the name of the Divines, we must conquer Cyrodiil and restore the glory of Reman's legacy. The cancerous Daedra worship that has corrupted Cyrodiil and threatens all Nirn shall be cleansed from Tamriel. We shall found the Tamriel Covenant, that all kingdoms may have a seat at the Grand Council under a new Imperial Dynasty. \n"
"\n"
"Forward, soldiers of the Covenant! Freedom for all peoples in the name of the Divines! For a new Empire and a new era of law and justice!"

"\n"
"We are well aware that the Aldmeri plan nothing less than a return to the Elven domination of the other races, particularly Men and Orcs. They wish to overturn the legacies of the First and Second Empires and wipe them from history. This we shall not allow. Never again will free Men and Orcs submit to the tyranny of Elven oppression!\n"

"The arrogant High Elves of Summerset are clearly the driving force behind the Dominion. We of the Covenant have shown, through our acceptance of the Direnni, that we can live with the Elves in peace, but Queen Ayrenn insists on war. Her invasion of the continent of Tamriel is nothing but naked aggression. The Dominion has no territorial rights in Cyrodiil. If the Altmer do not return to Summerset, their invading armies will be destroyed.\n"

"The Wood Elves and the Khajiit have traded with our Iliac Bay kingdoms for ages, but they've made a mistake in allying themselves with the perfidious Altmer of Summerset.

They must reconsider, or they must face our wrath."

"\"By the Code of Mauloch!\" I don't need you to guess how many times I've heard that oath made in some dingy tavern. Again and again, some fellow sellsword with too much fire in him has screamed those words at the top of his lungs. I'd be lying if I said the Orc strongholds don't take those words as law. There are few places where experience would tell you that \"tradition\" and the \"old ways\" make for a better fighter, but with Orcs, it seems like staying true to your ancestors is the path to victory. \n"
"\n"
"Let me start a few steps back. The Orc strongholds have existed as long as the Orc race has, at least according to them. Orc strongholds are more than armored camps. They're fortresses. Every man, woman, and child inside the walls is trained from birth to defend them. All their weapons and armor are smithed right there in the stronghold. All the food is hunted down by Orc warriors and brought back to be eaten by the Orcs who live there.\n"
"\n"
"Orcs follow no laws save their own, an unwritten set of rules called \"The Code of Mauloch,\" named after one of their gods, who is sometimes called Malacath. Most of it's pretty simple: don't steal, don't kill, and don't attack people without reason (although there seems to be a big list of exceptions). Orcs in a stronghold don't have jails for their criminals. They have Blood Price. You either pay enough in goods for your crimes, or you bleed enough that the victim is satisfied. And I don't need to tell you that Orcs have a lot of blood. \n"
"\n"
"The Code also sets up who runs the stronghold. The toughest male is usually the chief. He makes decisions and decides when the Code of Mauloch has been satisfied. All the women are either the chief's wives or his daughters, with the exception of the wise woman, who handles all spiritual matters and healing needs. Matters of grave dispute are handled with short but violent fights. Those who don't get along with the chief are usually forced out of the stronghold to live among the rest of us. An Orc grows up being told to fight for everything. If something is not worth fighting for, it is beneath the Code. \n"
"\n"
"The Orcs in a stronghold don't like strangers, used to living on their own like they do. We know about their homes because so many Orcs leave their strongholds to become sellswords or soldiers, and a few pints of mead always gets them talking about home. I hear that sometimes, when an Orc makes a non-Orc a \"blood kin,\" that person is allowed to live in the stronghold as one of the clan. Of course, I've never seen proof of that actually happening. \n"
"\n"
"For all their strange rules and traditions, the Code of Mauloch does breed a culture of determined warriors. They're focused in ways that the average sellsword isn't. They don't hesitate to draw weapons and settle matters openly. I think that's the real difference between the stronghold Orcs and the city Orcs. The law allows you to settle fights through the constable's men, but the Code of Mauloch demands you settle your problems yourself. That's a fine way of thinking when you're leading a mercenary's life."

"\"말락의 법대로!\" 네가 거무죽죽한 선술십에서 오크들의 맹세를 얼마나 들었는지 귀에 가시가 돋힐 지경이란 것을 알 수 있었다. 몇번이고 용병 녀석들은 맹세를 목청껏 외쳤다. 오크들에게서 그 말을 법처럼 여기지 않는다고 말하면, 그것은 거짓말일 것이다. \"전통\"과 \"오래된 방식\" 이 더 나은 투사를 만들어준다는 것을 경험할 수 있는 장소는 적지만, 오크들에게는 선조들의 말을 따르는 것이 승리의 비결인 것처럼 여겨진다.\n"
"\n"
"몇 걸음 물러나서 생각해보자.  오크 스트롱홀드는 오크 종족이 존재했던 시간만큼 오랫동안 존재해왔으며, 무장한 야영지 그 이상이다. 그곳은 요새이다. 벽 안의 모든 남자, 여자, 그리고 아이들은 태어날 때부터 스트롱홀드를 방어하기 위해 훈련받는다. 모든 무기와 방어구는 스트롱홀드에서 제조되어진다. 오크 전사들이 사냥을 통해 모든 음식을 얻고, 스트롱홀드에 살고 있는 오크들이 그 음식들을 먹는다. \n"
"\n"
"오크들은 \"말락의 법\"에 쓰여지지 않은 법은 따르지 않는다. 이 불문율의 법은 그들의 신들 중 하나인 말라카스의 이름을 따서 명명되어 졌다. 대부분은 간단하다. 훔치지 않고, 죽이지 않고, 이유없이 사람들을 공격하지 않는 것(예외의 경우가 있는 것처럼 보이지만). 스트롱홀드에 있는 오크들은 범죄를 저질러도 감옥을 가지 않는다. 그들에게는 피의 대가(Blood Price)가 있다. 범죄에 상응하는 재화를 충분히 지불하거나, 희생자가 만족할 때까지 피를 흘리게 한다. 또한 오크들이 수없이 많은 피의 대가를 치루고 있다는 것은 말할 필요가 없다.\n"
"\n"
"이 스트롱홀드를 운영하는 사람이 제정한다. 가장 강인한 사람이 보통 족장이 된다. 말락의 법이 만족되어질 때 그는 결정을 내린다. 영혼적 문제와 치유를 담당하는 지혜로운 여자들을 제외한 모든 여자들은 족장의 아내나 그의 딸이다. 중대한 분쟁의 문제들은 아주 폭력적인 싸움으로 단시간에 해결이 난다. 족장과 사이가 좋지않는 사람들은 일반적으로 스트롱홀드의 바깥에 살도록 강제된다. 오크는 모든 것을 위해 싸우라는 말을 들으며 자란다. 싸울만한 가치가 없는 것은 법보다 하등한 것이 된다.\n"
"\n"
"스트롱홀드의 오크들은 자신이 살고 싶은대로 사는 낯선 이들을 좋아하지 않는다. 스트롱홀드를 떠나 용병 또는 군인이 된 많은 오크들이 요새에 대한 이야기를 하기 때문에, 우리는 그들의 요새에 대해 알고 있다. 오크가 비 오크를 \"혈족\"으로 만들 때, 그 사람은 부족의 일원으로서 스트롱홀드에 사는 것을 허락받는다고 들은 적이 있다. 물론, 나는 그것에 대한 증거를 본 적이 없다.\n"
"\n"
"그들의 이상한 규칙과 전통을 위해, 말락 법전은 완강한 전사의 문화를 낳았다. 그들은 보통의 용병이 아니라는 점에 초점을 두고 있다. 그들은 주저않고 무기를 뽑아들고 문제를 공공연하게 해결한다. 스트롱홀드의 오크와 도시의 오크 간의 실제 차이점이라고 생각한다. 법은 보안관을 통해 싸움으로 해결하는 것을 허락하지만 마울로크의 법은 스스로 문제를 해결할 것을 요구한다. 당신이 용병의 삶을 따르고 있을 때 이 생각은 좋은 방법이라고 생각한다."

"Do not tempt the Daedra Lords with restlessness. Give to them freely as our ancestors did so that their dire gazes do not fall upon our tribe.

At Sancre Tor she prayed to Akatosh for the liberation of her people, and the Time Dragon granted her Three Visions to guide her in this task. Though the road was long and filled with hardship, her faith sustained her. When at last all three visions had come to pass and her people were freed of Elven domination, her purpose was fulfilled and she was called to Apotheosis. Then was she inducted into sainthood by Akatosh himself, and granted the Amulet of Kings, for the sacred rulers of the Empire to wear for ever and beyond.\""

"The ruination that came to the Ayleids was inevitable. It was not, as less astute scholars postulate, due to the will of the Aedra or some absurd mystical agent, but was a result of their degenerate Daedra worship and gross underestimation of their slaves. The human leaders who challenged the Ayleids, Saint Alessia in particular, recognized the cultural rot weakening their captors and took advantage of it to orchestrate one of the greatest triumphs of Men.\n"
"\n"
"The debauched Elves were apparently quite creative when it came to devising new horrors to inflict on their slaves. It is no shock that practices such as \"flesh-sculpture\" would drive the tormented men and women of Cyrodiil to rebellion. In their smug complacency, the Elves could not conceive of the possibility of an uprising—which was well for the slaves, who would have been summarily crushed by the Ayleids at the height of their power.\n"
"\n"
"As evidenced by the ruins found throughout Tamriel, the Ayleids were an incredible force. The source of their prodigious might, however, was also the catalyst of their decline. Deals with Daedric Princes granted them the power they sought. They thought themselves in control—typical Elven arrogance—as poison crept into their society. The various Daedric cults began bickering and backstabbing, as is their wont, forming the cracks the rebellion would exploit.\n"
"\n"
"Another critical factor in the dissolution of Ayleid rule was the indomitable will of the oppressed. We have all read accounts of heroic deeds executed by the likes of Alessia, Morihaus, and Pelinal Whitestrake. While it's obvious to anyone with a modicum of intellect that these tales are a bit hyperbolic, it is quite clear that exceptional individuals made the establishment of the First Empire possible.\n"
"\n"
"Alessia's Slave Army was populated with many examples of the true potential of Man. It is a pity that more texts have not survived, for the few we retain give us little insight, and dishonest scholars often distort them for slanderous political purposes. My own ancestor, \"Tharanus Ye Redde-Hand,\" has been painted as either a slave-overseer or even implied to be identical to Tharhan, the Mutilant of the Gradual Massacre, based on ridiculous interpretations of obscure and questionable footnotes. The jealousy of lesser men, while I sometimes savor it, can be such an annoyance at times.\n"
"\n"
"In reality, based on the rare texts I have had the privilege of consulting in the vaults of White-Gold itself, including the recently-discovered Scroll of Precursor Saints, Tharanus was a critical supporter of Alessia's cause, disrupting supply routes through forged logistical orders and even leading his own battalion into some of the war's bloodiest conflicts. Sadly, the slanderous have sunk so low as to make preposterous accusations that I forged the scroll myself. Despicable.\n"
"\n"
"Given the weakness of the Ayleids and the inspiring members of Alessia's retinue, the outcome of the war was determined before the first slaver was beheaded. The Slave Rebellion both teaches a cautionary lesson about the idiocy of trifling with the Daedra and demonstrates the power of men, who have rightfully ruled the heart of Tamriel since. As they always shall."

"The Ebonheart Pact has forged an unlikely alliance between the far-flung nations of Morrowind, Skyrim, and Black Marsh, bringing together the Dark Elves, Nords, and free Argonians for their mutual defense. Thanks to the size of its allied nations and the distances involved, the Pact remains relatively free of inner strife and discord. The Nords and Dark Elves have so much of their own territory to deal with that they have little time to spare for meddling in each other's affairs.\n"
"\n"
"The Ebonheart Pact came about in 2E 572 in response to the Second Akaviri Invasion of northern Tamriel. The Nords, Dark Elves, and free Argonians joined forces to save the rest of Tamriel from slaughter and subjugation. Forged in war, the alliance brought a sudden new power to the continent. At first, few believed the Dark Elves would be able to maintain an alliance with their ancient blood enemies and former slaves, but after a troubled decade, the Pact remains strong and intact.\n"
"\n"
"A Great Moot governs the Pact. This council of equals from each of the member races is not only known for hot tempers and loud voices, but also for mutual respect and an amazing will to hold the Pact together against all odds. Only as equals can the allies hope to mollify the pride of the Nords and the Dark Elves while addressing the injuries suffered by the once-enslaved Argonians. \n"
"\n"
"Serving as an integral, perhaps even critical, part of the alliance, the Dark Elves of Morrowind are aloof, proud, and profoundly strange. They work hard to conceal their disdain for their \"inferior\" allies, but the current crisis requires the strong arms of Nords and wily resourcefulness of Argonians to keep rival alliances at bay. Wizardly craft and a deep well of experience serve the Dark Elves well, providing the Pact with the vital ability to react and adapt—something neither the Aldmeri Dominion nor the Daggerfall Covenant can claim to do as well. The Pact fields superior warriors and sorcerers. And they possess an asset that no other race can match. Three living gods—Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil—abide among them.\n"
"\n"
"The Nords of Eastern Skyrim are fearless and aggressive, industrious and enterprising. They excel at war and prosper in trade, and they are without equal as explorers and trailblazers. Strong, stubborn, and hardy, they customarily solve problems through combat. Nords cheerfully rush into battle with a ferocity that frightens and appalls their enemies. They accept and even revel in their role as shock troops for the Ebonheart Pact. Nords are direct, not subtle: they champion simple solutions in the meetings of the Great Moot, though they are often outvoted by shrewd Argonians and sagacious Dark Elves. On the field of battle, however, they have no equals. Pact generals tend to be Nords, as are most of the soldiers in the field. The Nords don't mind. This means they also get first choice of the spoils of war.\n"
"\n"
"By their decisive intervention against the Akaviri, the Argonians of Black Marsh won their freedom from Dark Elf enslavement, and the lessons they learned have made them a valuable member of the Pact. Reserved and alien, their expressionless faces and flat intonations make it difficult for other races to interpret their true motives. Nevertheless, the Argonians possess a cool intelligence. Slow to trust and hard to know, their natural agility makes them as comfortable employing magic as they are using stealth and steel. Years of defending their borders have made them experts in waging war against stronger, more traditionally organized armies. Equally at home on land or in water, they serve as scouts and skirmishers for Pact forces. Other aspects of Argonian culture are nearly incomprehensible to outsiders, including their social hierarchy and collective decision making. Their representatives present strange proposals without explanation, but their allies have learned that there's always a reason for everything they do.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the young Jorunn the Skald King serves as the acting High King of the Moot, but not all in the alliance support him. As the members of the Pact struggle to maintain and solidify their alliance, they must also deal with internal threats to each of their nations. Unsolved, these threats could destroy them before they ever face the Dominion or Covenant in open battle."

"Written by the Esteemed Historian Homfrey at the University of Gwylim, 2E 455\n"
"\n"
"Being a Survey of the Triumphant Settlement of the Heartland High Elves in the Southern Regions \n"
"\n"
"…At this point, we should mention the remarkable cities of Ceyatatar, and the Ayleid settlement beneath what is now modern Bravil. These cities, along with the Valenwood cities of Haven, Woodhearth, and Silvenar, all flourished as a result of increased trade after the establishment of the great White-Gold Tower in what is now the heart of Cyrodiil. \n"
"\n"
"Of note in particular is the university and libraries at nearby Elden Root. The Ayleids there built their city in and around what is called the Elden Tree or the First Tree, believed by many to be the tree that seeded all of Valenwood. \n"
"\n"
"Both Haven and Woodhearth were destroyed utterly by the sieging Maormer, who cared little for the advanced and enlightened ways of the Valenwood Aldmer. Marching inland, they plundered not only the Elden Root enclave, but also the Great Tree itself.  What villainous tribe would injure and pillage such magnificence? \n"
"\n"
"It is possible that the Maormer had broken the Aldmer traditions of racial purity and intermingled with indigenous, bestial tribes of Pyandonea. This would explain their savagery and lack of regard for the greatness of mainland Elven culture."

"\"Mix it like this,\" said Rakhal. She ground wet clay and herbs beneath her pestle with rhythmic strokes. \"The very act of creating the paint is a prayer.\"\n"
"\n"
"Yashirr grasped her own stone pestle, pulled her bowl closer and imitated the priestess.\n"
"\n"
"Pound! Lift! Scatter a handful of herbs into the bowl, and pound again! The Orcs sat close together, knee to knee, bowls held in curve of their bent knees.\n"
"\n"
"Rakhal chanted softly, swaying with her movements. Gradually, as the group's rhythm strengthened, her voice gained matching volume.\n"
"\n"
"\"Mauloch!\" Pound!\n"
"\n"
" \"Witness …\" Lift!\n"
"\n"
"\"… our deeds!\" Scatter!\n"
"\n"
"The honor of preparing tribal paint went to a handful of the Chief's daughters. Yashiir had never sat in the circle before. In prior years, she'd gathered the herbs and clay, but nothing more. Now she sat at Rakhal's right hand in a place of honor. Pride washed through the young Wood Orc. Clearly, she had been chosen as an apprentice!\n"
"\n"
"\"Mauloch!\" Pound!\n"
"\n"
"\"Give us …\" Lift!\n"
"\n"
"\"… blood!\" Scatter!\n"
"\n"
"At that final word, the women threw back their heads and released Mauloch's Call, a throaty howl that echoed through the trees and nearby cliffs. Rakhal signaled their work's completion.\n"
"\n"
"The tribe lined up to be painted with the fresh battle-red clay. Rakhal waved those she deemed unworthy or unfit for the battle aside. They weren't allowed to partake in the painting ritual.\n"
"\n"
"When Rakhal motioned to Yashirr to step from the line, Yashirr parted her lips to protest, then pursed them tightly. To question Rakhal's judgment would bring dishonor. Bowing her head in confused anger, Yashirr joined the handful of the unselected Orcs.\n"
"\n"
"Rakhal looked over the unselected, and pulled Yashirr to her side. \"Mauloch chose you to perform the next ritual, child. Take the blade and remember: Mauloch watches you.\"\n"
"\n"
"Guiding Yashirr's hand, Rakhal leaned over the empty vessel and slid the young Orc's blade across her outstretched neck. Rakhal's hand did not falter even as she slipped from consciousness in order to provide the next paint with the sacred blood of a true warrior."

"By Naral, also known as Baretail. The memoir is undated.\n"
"\n"
"My children, Naral sets this down to give insight into the strange ways of the Wood Elves amongst whom some of you travel. Beware their vengeful ways!\n"
"\n"
"Preparations began months ago for the wedding feast of the two highest Wood Elves. Their union shows that the forest and its people are as one. Hence, a very large feast.\n"
"\n"
"As a trader, I've often been tasked with providing tidbits for royalty. I name no names, but freely admit to providing biscuits dusted with moon sugar for banquets in Elden Root on more than one occasion. Still, this wedding feast required many things outside my purview, and I was forced to make last-minute changes.\n"
"\n"
"To get fifty vats of beef broth, I supplemented the thirty vats available by adding root vegetable broth.  Knowing the Wood Elves are not squeamish about the dead, I provided ten crates of bone marrow from whatever bones were available, asking no questions as to their origins.\n"
"\n"
"But cake with no flour? Never had I seen such a thing before! I consulted with several Wood Elf bakers who assured me such a thing was possible, as Wood Elves eat nothing green unless prepared by outsiders. Given that, their restriction that I provide cakes without flour flummoxed me. I got a couple of recipes and checked with my suppliers, none of whom could provide the desired quantity in time.\n"
"\n"
"Thus, I set about making them myself. I thinned the eggs with water to make them stretch. I added arrowroot and powdered flax seed to thicken it. Sugar proved the most dear component of the cakes, so I added ground chalk to reduce the actual amount of sugar needed. The taste was similar to cake. Very similar. And since they took so little time and gold to make, my profit doubled from the cakes alone.\n"
"\n"
"It was the substitution of flax seed oil whipped with lard instead of butter that proved my undoing, and the undoing of many a guest's bowels.\n"
"\n"
"Not only did the Wood Elves rescind any future contracts, but they shaved my tail and confiscated all the gear and goods I'd left behind in my hasty retreat.\n"
"\n"
"Never, my children, offer to supply goods for a Wood Elf feast. It will only end in tears."

"The storm threw an unexpected twist in Captain Saraja's plan. She eyed the pirate sloop's torn sails and broken mast. Not only had their most recent haul washed overboard, but now they'd be becalmed until they could afford repairs.\n"
"\n"
"\"We're as good as grounded,\" First Mate Huruz said grimly.\n"
"\n"
"\"If we see another ship, I'm sure we can talk them out of it,\" the captain replied with a throaty chuckle. \"We're disabled, but still afloat. You're always thinking about disasters.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Better safe than … is that another ship?\"\n"
"\n"
"Saraja turned and grinned. \"Our future ship, you mean.\"\n"
"\n"
"Huruz eyed the distance and said thoughtfully, \"It's not that far. Let's lower the dinghy.\"\n"
"\n"
"Within moments, the Khajiiti crew prepared themselves to row to the other vessel. It was anchored near a sandbar and appeared undamaged. As they approached, Saraja scanned the line between the ship and sky, looking for movement. All quiet. Ripe for the plunder.\n"
"\n"
"Huruz climbed up, slowly digging into the ship's dark hull. He had to overpower any guard on this side, enabling the rest of the crew to secure lines and board. Landing softly on the deck, Huruz glanced quickly fore and aft. No guards. He leaned over the rail and signaled the crew.\n"
"\n"
"One by one, the pirates boarded, padding along the deck silently with weapons drawn until they were all aboard the silent ship.\n"
"\n"
"\"Too big a ship to be on a pleasure cruise,\" Huruz murmured to the captain. \"And too quiet to be well-armed.\"\n"
"\n"
"Saraja nodded, gesturing toward the cabin's door. \"They're hiding in there,\" she whispered. \"Time for them to get off my ship.\"\n"
"\n"
"With a loud battle cry, Huruz kicked open the cabin door. The pirates, claws unsheathed and weapons high, pushed in after him before coming to a stop not ten paces into the quiet, dark space.\n"
"\n"
"\"What's amiss?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Quick! Get me a light!\"\n"
"\n"
"One of the pirates slammed tinder and flint together. He raised the torch slowly, its warm glow reflecting across dozens of mirrors strewn throughout the cabin.\n"
"\n"
"\"By Jone and Jode, Kothringi!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Dead Kothringi!\"\n"
"\n"
"Saraja ordered everyone back to their crippled ship, though it was already too late. No one who'd seen the Crimson Ship ever lived to tell the tale, and her crew had done more than see it."

"Life for many in the Aldmeri Dominion begins in Valenwood. Green, forested, filled with a wide variety of plant and animal life, and home to some of the first Elves from Old Ehlnofey.\n"
"\n"
"Over time and through generations, these early settlers adapted to the woods. They learned stealth and cunning by studying their new prey. Eventually, they became Wood Elves, or Bosmer. Slighter than the Altmer, intense and agile, the Bosmer are renowned archers and scouts.\n"
"\n"
"Fierce combatants, the Bosmer have an unusual advantage: the Green Pact. According to Bosmer legend, Y'ffre the Forest God offered them a way to defeat their enemies, providing they did not consume, harm, or harvest any of Valenwood's plants. \n"
"\n"
"Many have heard of the Wild Hunt, one result of the Green Pact. Of this ritual, I will say no more.\n"
"\n"
"The Bosmer welcome those who come to Valenwood seeking refuge from other lands. In this regard, they are quite unlike their pure Altmer cousins. While we seek to retain our dignity, the Bosmer are quite willing to bend like saplings to the will of others.\n"
"\n"
"Though they are unruly and naive, these Wood Elves are an integral part of the Dominion, and must be retained in order for our alliance to flourish."

"Willowleg rubbed his ankle. Not broken, just twisted. He stood, putting weight on it very carefully. Good. It would hold. He'd fallen while on a journey through Valenwood. One of his legs was thinner than the other.  Sometimes he forgot.\n"
"\n"
"\"Now to figure out where I am,\" Willowleg said. He looked at the swaying leaves high above, the hint of blue sky occasionally peeking through. To anyone but a Wood Elf, those brief glimpses would convey nothing, but Willowleg immediately turned to continue on his way.\n"
"\n"
"Soon, he realized he wasn't alone. A little to his left walked another Wood Elf, dark green hair hanging unkempt about his face. Willowleg, used to traveling alone, noticed that his silent companion adjusted his pace to remain close without overtaking him.\n"
"\n"
"\"Going to Falinesti, too?\" Willowleg asked.\n"
"\n"
"\"Yes.\"\n"
"\n"
"Willowleg said congenially, \"I hope I reach the summer site before it's too late.\"\n"
"\n"
"The green-haired Wood Elf said, \"You'll be fine.\" His tone indicated he didn't wish to speak further, so Willowleg simply nodded and kept walking.\n"
"\n"
"They traveled together, silently, for the rest of the day. When Willowleg stopped to rest, the stranger also stopped. Willowleg shared water and dried meat. Then they began the last part of their journey. The trees thinned out, leaving a clearing into which Falinesti fit perfectly.\n"
"\n"
"At the clearing's edge, the stranger stopped and put a hand on Willowleg's arm. Surprised, Willowleg realized the green-haired Elf's skin was rough and thick, like bark.\n"
"\n"
"\"Stay here,\" the stranger said, murmuring an incantation.\n"
"\n"
"Willowleg, unable to move or speak, watched his companion walk to Falinesti's base and touch its bark with his forehead. The tree-city shuddered and began to move slowly, lifting its roots from the earth.\n"
"\n"
"As the green-haired Elf walked off, leading Falinesti away, Willowleg felt the strange spell over him break, and movement returned with a tingling force through his limbs. He glanced down and saw that not only had his thin leg healed, but his shoes were missing.\n"
"\n"
"\"The Woodsmer,\" Willowleg whispered in awe. The Woodsmer, the mythic one who led the unwary astray in the woods, was also known to bestow favors on those who knew their way.\n"
"\n"
"As Falinesti moved southward, Willowleg wondered which the city was."

"And written by Adandora, Chronicler at Large\n"
"\n"
"Who's the biggest, baddest, brashest thug in Abah's Landing? Shalug the Shark, that's who! In her own words, she leads the largest and strongest band of cutthroats in the city, and she isn't shy about tooting her own horn. But who is Shalug? And who are the Shark's Teeth? Let me recount the legend of the Shark for all the world to marvel at.\n"
"\n"
"Shalug is a humble Orc from humble beginnings. She fled the mountains of Wrothgar at the first opportunity, working her way south aboard whatever ship she could find passage on. Soon, Shalug earned the name, \"the Shark,\" as she jumped from one pirate crew to the next in order to find her fame and fortune. But despite her successes and her growing infamy, Shalug decided that a life on the sea wasn't in her best interests. \"Too many waves,\" Shalug told me. \"And too many captains.\"\n"
"\n"
"Looking to become her own boss, Shalug eventually found herself in Abah's Landing. Always the toughest one around, she soon attracted a growing number of followers to her side. In time, her little gang became a small army, and the Shark's Teeth was born. With a thriving business in protection and stolen goods, Shalug and her gang took control of an out-of-the-way grotto that had long ago been abandoned by the colonists who tried to make a home of the place. It wasn't long before the place became known as Shark's Teeth Grotto, a place feared by pirates and guards alike due to the power of Shalug's gang.\n"
"\n"
"Writer's Note: Shalug, while everything you've told me has a modicum of truth to it, I can't help but believe that you've exaggerated certain details to make yourself sound more prominent than you really are. The journalist in me cannot, in good conscience, continue to take your gold or put these fabrications to paper. I'm leaving you with what I've done so far. I'm certain you'll be able to find someone with fewer scruples who would be happy to complete it for you."

"The Eight\n"
"\n"
"Kyne (Kiss at the End):\n"
"\n"
"Nord Goddess of the Storm. Widow of Shor and favored god of warriors, she is often called the Mother of Men. Her daughters taught the first Nords the use of the Thu'um or \"Storm Voice.\"\n"
"\n"
"Mara (Goddess of Love):\n"
"\n"
"For the Nords, Mara is a handmaiden of Kyne and concubine of Shor. As the goddess of fertility and agriculture, she's sometimes associated with Nir of the \"Anuad,\" the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation.\n"
"\n"
"Dibella (Goddess of Beauty):\n"
"\n"
"Popular god of the Eight Divines. She has nearly a dozen different cults, some devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction.\n"
"\n"
"Stuhn (God of Ransom):\n"
"\n"
"Nord precursor to Stendarr, brother of Tsun, shield-thane of Shor. Stuhn was a warrior god who fought against the Aldmeri pantheon. He showed Men how to take (and the benefits of taking) prisoners of war.\n"
"\n"
"Jhunal (Rune God):\n"
"\n"
"God of knowledge and hermetic orders, precursor of Julianos. Never very popular among the mercurial and warlike Nords, his worship is fading.\n"
"\n"
"Shor (God of the Underworld):\n"
"\n"
"The Nord version of Lorkhan, Shor allied with Men after the creation of the world. Foreign gods (that is, Elven ones) conspired against him and brought about his defeat, dooming him to the afterlife, Sovngarde. Atmoran myths depict him as a bloodthirsty warrior king who led the Nords to victory over their Aldmeri oppressors time and again. Before his doom, Shor was the chief of the gods. He is sometimes called the Children's God (see \"Orkey.\") Considered a \"dead god,\" Shor has no priesthood and is not actively worshiped, but he is frequently sworn by.\n"
"\n"
"Orkey (Old Knocker):\n"
"\n"
"God of mortality, Orkey combines aspects of Mauloch and Arkay. He is a \"loan-god\" for the Nords, who seem to have taken up his worship during Aldmeri rule of Atmora. Nords believe they once lived as long as Elves until Orkey appeared; through heathen trickery, he fooled them into a bargain that \"bound them to the count of winters.\" At one time, legends say, Nords only had a lifespan of six years due to Orkey's foul magic. Then Shor showed up and, through unknown means, removed the curse, throwing most of it onto the nearby Orcs.\n"
"\n"
"Alduin (The World-Eater):\n"
"\n"
"Alduin is the Nord variation of Akatosh. He only superficially resembles his counterpart in the Imperial Eight Divines. For example, Alduin's sobriquet, \"the World Eater,\" comes from myths that depict him as the horrible, ravaging firestorm that destroyed the last world to begin this one. Nords therefore see the god of time as both creator and harbinger of the apocalypse. He is not the chief of the Nord pantheon (in fact, this pantheon has no chief; see \"Shor\") but its wellspring, albeit a grim and frightening one.\n"
"\n"
"Alduin destroyed the last world to enable the creation of this one, and he will destroy this one to enable the next. Alduin was once worshiped by the long-dead Dragon Cult, but that has been outlawed for centuries, so Alduin has no admitted worshipers.\n"
"\n"
"Testing Gods\n"
"\n"
"Herma-Mora (The Woodland Man):\n"
"\n"
"Ancient Atmoran \"Demon of Knowledge\" who nearly seduced the Nords into becoming Aldmer. Most Ysgramor myths are about escaping the wiles of old Herma-Mora. Unlike his Bosmeri adherents, the Nords don't deny his Daedric nature.\n"
"\n"
"Mauloch (God of Orcs, \"Mountain Fart\"):\n"
"\n"
"Clearly identified for the Nords with the Daedric Prince Malacath, Mauloch tests them through warfare. Mauloch troubled the heirs of King Harald for a long time. Fleeing east after his defeat at the Battle of Dragon Wall, ca. 1E 660, his rage was said to fill the sky with his sulfurous hatred, earning that year the sobriquet \"Year of Winter in Summer.\"\n"
"\n"
"Dead God\n"
"\n"
"Tsun:\n"
"\n"
"Extinct Nord god of trials against adversity. Died defending Shor from foreign gods."

"\n"
"춘의 형제. 스텐다르를 향한 노드족의 지도자이다. 쇼어의 수호기사인, 스툰은 알드머의 신들에 대항해 싸웠던 전사 신이었다. 그는 전쟁에서 포로를 포획하고 그것을 통하여 이익을 얻는 방법을 인간들에게 보여주었다.\n"

"주날 (룬의 신):\n"

"지식과 비밀 결사의 신 줄리아노스의 선지자. 활발하고 호전적인 노드족 사이에서는 인기가 없는 신이다. 그의 숭배자는 점점 줄어들고 있다.\n"

"쇼어 (사후세계의 신):\n"
"\n"
"로칸의 노드족 판이며, 세계의 창조 이후에는 인류를 지지했다. 외래신들(예로는 엘프의 신들)은 그에 대항해 함께 모략하여 그가 패배하게 만들어 사후세계인 소븐가르드로 보내버렸다고 한다. 아트모라의 신화는 그를 노드족들이 알드머족의 압제를 받던 시기에 승리로 이끌어주는 피에 목말라하는 전사들의 왕으로 묘사한다. 그가 패배하기 전까지, 쇼어는 신들의 우두머리였다. 가끔씩 아이들의 신이라고도 불린다.(\"오르케이\" 참조) \"죽음의 신\"으로 여겨지는 쇼어는 섬기는 사제도 없고 활발하게 숭배되지도 않지만, 자주 맹세의 대상이 되고는 한다.\n"
"\n"
"오르케이 (고대의 두드리는 자):\n"
"\n"
"필멸의 신 오르케이는 마울록과 알케이의 특성을 섞었다. 노드의 \"빌린 신\"으로, 아트모라의 알드머족 통치기간 동안에 그에 대한 신앙이 늘어난 것으로 보인다. 노드족들은 자신들이 오르케이가 나타나기 전까지는 엘프들처럼 긴 수명을 가졌다고 믿고 있다. 노드족을 속여서 \"몇 번의 겨울을 지냈는지에 따라 나이를 연관짓는\" 협상을 맺게 만들었다고 한다. 전설에 의하면 오르케이의 악독한 마법 때문에 노드족들은 어느 시점에는 단 6년의 수명만을 가지게 되었다고 한다. 그러나 쇼어가 나타나 알려지지 않은 방법을 통하여 그 저주를 제거하였으며, 그 대부분을 근처의 오크들에게 옮겨버렸다고 한다.\n"
"\n"
"알두인 (세계를 삼키는 자):\n"
"\n"
"알두인은 아카토쉬의 노드 판이라고 할 만한 존재이다. 제국의 여덟 디바인과 유사한 점은 표면적으로만 그럴 뿐이다. 예를 들어, 알두인의 \"세계를 삼키는 자\"라는 이명은 그를 묘사한 신화에서 유래했다. 그 신화에서 알두인은 세상을 유린하는 무서운 불꽃 폭풍으로 그려진다. 그 불꽃에 의해 지난 세계가 파괴되고 지금의 세계가 탄생했다는 것이다. 이로 미루어 볼 때 노드인은 아카토쉬를 창조자이면서 동시에 멸망을 불러오는 시간의 신으로 보고 있는 것이다. 노드인의 신앙에서 알두인은 주신이 아니며(사실 노드인 신앙에는 주신이라는 개념 자체가 없다. 아래의 쇼어를 보자.), 모든 신들의 원천이다. 비록 그가 음산하고 무서움을 주는 존재일지라도 말이다.\n"
"\n"
"알두인은 지금의 세계를 만들기 위해 이전의 세계를 파괴했다. 그는 또한 다음 세계를 만들기 위해 지금의 세계를 파괴할 것이다. 알두인은 이전에 사라진 지 오래된 드래곤 교단에게 숭배받는 존재였다. 하지만 수 세기 전 드래곤 교단이 비합법화된 이후, 현재 알두인을 공공연히 숭배하는 사람은 없다.\n"

"\n"
"The Dunmer are descended from the Chimer, who were apostates of the Aldmeri's Aedra worship. As the Alessian Reforms never took hold in Morrowind, their pantheon bears little resemblance to the rest of Tamriel. The Dark Elves' original religion was worship of several Daedric Princes, the so-called \"Good Daedra,\" but that has been largely superseded by reverence for the \"Living Gods\" of the Tribunal.\n"
"\n"
"The Tribunal\n"
"\n"
"Almalexia (Mother Morrowind):\n"
"\n"
"Most traces of Auri-El disappeared from ancient Chimer legends during their so-called \"exodus,\" primarily due to that god's association and esteem with the Altmeri. However, most aspects of Auri-El that seem so important to the mortal races—namely immortality, historicity, and genealogy—have conveniently resurfaced in Almalexia, the most popular of Morrowind's divine Tribunal.\n"
"\n"
"Vivec (Master of Morrowind):\n"
"\n"
"Warrior-poet god of the Dunmer. Vivec is the invisible keeper of the holy land, ever vigilant against the dark gods of the Volcano. He/she has saved the Dunmeri people from certain death on numerous occasions.\n"
"\n"
"Sotha Sil (Mystery of Morrowind):\n"
"\n"
"God of the Dunmer, Sotha Sil is the least known of the divine Tribunal. He is said to be reshaping the world from his hidden, clockwork city.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Good\" Daedra\n"
"\n"
"Boethiah (Prince of Plots):\n"
"\n"
"Heralded by the Prophet Veloth, Boethiah is the original god-ancestor of the Dark Elves. Through his/her illuminations, the eventual \"Chimer,\" or Changed Folk, renounced all ties to the Aldmer and founded a new nation based on Daedric principles. All manner of Dark Elven cultural \"advances\" are attributed to Boethiah, from philosophy to magic to \"responsible\" architecture. Ancient Velothi allegories are uniformly heroic successes of Boethiah over enemies of every type, serving as foundation stories of Chimeri struggle. Also known as the Anticipation of Almalexia.\n"
"\n"
"Mephala (Androgyne):\n"
"\n"
"Mephala is the Webspinner or Spider God. In Morrowind, he/she was the ancestor who taught the Chimer the skills they would need to evade their enemies or murder them in secret. Enemies were numerous in those days, since the Chimer were a small faction. He/she, along with Boethiah, organized the clan systems that eventually became the basis for the Great Houses. He/she founded the Morag Tong. Also called the Anticipation of Vivec.\n"
"\n"
"Azura (Goddess of Dusk and Dawn):\n"
"\n"
"Azura was the god-ancestor who taught the Chimer the mysteries needed to be different than the Altmer. Some of her more conventional teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, Azura is often more a communal cosmic force for the race as a whole than an ancestor or a god. Also known as the Anticipation of Sotha Sil.\n"
"\n"
"The Missing God\n"
"\n"
"Lorkhan (The Missing God):\n"
"\n"
"This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri \"Lorkhan\" or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane. This upset the status quo, much like his father, Padomay, who introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and eventually wanders the creation of the et'Ada. He and his metaphysical placement in the \"scheme of things\" is interpreted a variety of ways. In Morrowind, he is a being related to the Psijic Endeavor, a process by which mortals are charged with transcending the gods that created them.\n"
"\n"
"Four Corners of the House of Troubles, \"Testing Gods\"\n"
"\n"
"Enemy gods, more to be placated and appeased than worshiped.\n"
"\n"
"Molag Bal (God of Schemes, Lord of Brutality):\n"
"\n"
"Daedric power of much importance in Morrowind. There, he is always the archenemy of Boethiah, the Prince of Plots. He is the main source of the obstacles to the Dunmer (and preceding Chimer) people. In legends, Molag Bal always tries to upset the bloodlines of Great Houses or otherwise ruin Dunmeri \"purity.\" A race of supermonsters, said to live in Molag Amur, are the result of his seduction of Vivec during the previous era.\n"
"\n"
"Malacath (God of Curses):\n"
"\n"
"In Dunmer myth, Boethiah swallowed Aldmer hero-god Trinimac and excreted him as Malacath. A somewhat weak but vengeful Daedra, the Dark Elves say he is also Malak, the god-king of the Orcs. He always tests the Dunmer for physical weakness.\n"
"\n"
"Sheogorath (The Mad God):\n"
"\n"
"The fearful obeisance of Sheogorath is widespread, and it is found in most Tamrielic quarters. Contemporary sources indicate that his roots are in Aldmeri creation stories; therein, he is \"born\" when Lorkhan's divine spark is removed. One crucial myth calls him the \"Sithis-shaped hole\" of the world. He tests the Dunmer for mental weakness and tempts the Great Houses into treachery against each other.\n"
"\n"
"Mehrunes Dagon (God of Destruction):\n"
"\n"
"Popular Daedric power. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. In some cultures, Dagon is merely a god of bloodshed and betrayal. He is an especially important deity in Morrowind, where he represents its near-inhospitable terrain."

"메팔라는 물레를 돌리는 자, 즉 거미 신으로 알려져 있다. 메팔라는 치머들에게 적을 피하거나 은밀하게 살해하는 기술을 가르쳐 준 조상으로 알려져 있다. 그 시절에는 치머가 소규모 집단이었기 때문에 적이 무수히 많았다. 메팔라는 보에시아와 함께 마침내 집단 체계를 갖춰서 대가문을 설립했다. 또한 모락 통도 설립하였다. 비벡의 수호자로도 불린다.\n"

"\n"
"By Hrothmund Wolf-Heart\n"
"\n"
"Respected reader. My name is Hrothmund Wolf-Heart, and I am a Nord. But, more importantly, I am a Nord born and raised in the land of Skyrim.\n"
"\n"
"I write this volume in the desperate hope that the rest of Tamriel can come to know my people as they deserve to be known, and understand this province for what it truly is—a place of uncontested beauty and culture.\n"
"\n"
"Some of what you know is undoubtedly true. Physically, we Nords are an impressive, often imposing sight—tall of stature, strong of bone, and thick of muscle. Our hair is often fair, and worn braided, as has been the custom for generations. Often we are swathed in the hides of beasts, for such creatures are abundant in Skyrim, and we would be foolish not to take advantage of such an available resource.\n"
"\n"
"Having read this far, you may be shocked at the strength of my words, and the literacy of a northern \"savage.\" Aye, many Nords can both read and write. My father began my instruction in the way of letters when I was but a bairn, as did his father, and his father before him.\n"
"\n"
"But the accomplishments of the children of Skyrim are multitude, and go beyond mere wordcraft. For we are artisans as well, and through the ages have learned to manipulate steel the way a sculptor would clay.\n"
"\n"
"Indeed, I have seen with mine own eyes, visitors from High Rock and Cyrodiil weep in disbelief as they beheld the blades wrought in the fires of the Skyforge, and honed to beautiful deadliness by the gods-touched hands of Clan Gray-Mane.\n"
"\n"
"But how can this be true, you ask? How are such achievements possible from a people who have yet to emerge from the muck and snow? Again, provincial bias clouds the truth.\n"
"\n"
"The cities of Skyrim are a testament to Nord ingenuity and craftsmanship. Chief among them are Solitude, seat of the High King and capital of the province; Windhelm, ancient and honored, a jewel in the snow; Markarth, carved into the living rock itself, in ages long since past; Riften, nestled in the golden shadows of the Fall Forest, whence comes delicious fish and mead; and Whiterun, built around the hall of Jorrvaskr, home of the most noble Companions and revered Skyforge.\n"
"\n"
"And now, respected reader, you have the full measure of it. We Nords are everything you imagined—and so much more.\n"
"\n"
"But let not this work be your only gateway to the truth. Book passage on carriage or vessel, and make the journey north. See Skyrim with thine own eyes. See Skyrim as have the Nords, since the gods first shaped the world."

"\n"
"나는 나의 국민들이 탐리엘의 모든 것을 알 수 있도록, 부정할수 없는 아름다움과 문화를 갖춘 이 장소를 국민들에게 알려주도록 간절히 바라며 이 글을 적겠다.\n"

"당신이 아는 몇가지 이야기는 명백한 사실이다. 신체적으로 우리 노드는 큰 키, 강한 뼈, 두꺼운 근육으로 눈길을 끈다. 우리의 금발 머리는 조상 대대로 땋은 머리를 이어 유지하고 있다. 우리가 입는 옷은 짐승의 가죽으로, 스카이림에서 흔히 볼 수 있는 짐승의 가죽을 사용한다. 풍부한 자원을 이용하지 않는 것은 바보같은 짓이다.\n"
"\n"
"여기까지 읽었다면, 당신은 내가 쓰는 단어의 강도와 글을 읽고 쓸 줄 아는 \"야만인\"이 있다는 것에 놀랐을 것이다. 그래, 노드는 읽고 쓰는 법을 안다. 나의 아버지는 내가 어렸을때 부터 편지쓰는 법을 알려주셨다. 아버지의 아버지도 그랬고, 할아버지의 아버지도 그랬다.\n"
"\n"
"하지만 스카이림의 아이들이 가지고 있는 능력은 언어능력 뿐만이 아니라 다양하다. 우리는 조각가가 흙으로 조각을 하는 것처럼 강철을 다루는 법을 배웠다.\n"
"\n"
"실제로, 하이락 지방과 시로딜에서 온 사람들이 스카이포지 화염속에서 칼이 만들어지는 믿을 수 없는 장면과 그레이-메인 일족이 보여준 신의 손놀림이라고 해도 좋은 기술을 보고 눈물을 흘리는 것을 내 눈으로 직접 보았다.\n"
"\n"
"하지만 어떻게 그런 일이 일어날 수 있느냐고 당신은 묻겠지? 어떻게 지저분하고 눈덮힌 곳에서 이러한 성과가 나왔는지 궁금하겠지. 다시 한 번 말하자면, 그런 편견때문에 진실이 가려져 있는것이다.\n"
"\n"
"스카이림의 도시들은 노드의 재주와 솜씨의 증거다. 그 중 최고를 나열하자면, 도시의 국왕, 솔리튜드가 앉는 의자, 윈드헬름의 눈 속에 있는 보석,  마르카스의 오래 전부터 존재하던 바위로 만든 조각, 리프튼의 황금빛 그림자가 주는 따뜻함과 맛있는 물고기와 벌꿀주, 화이트런에 있는 귀족들과 스카이포지에서 존경받는 사람들의 집이 요바스카를 빙 둘러 지어져있다.\n"
"\n"
"그리고 지금, 존경하는 독자들이여, 우리 노드는 당신이 상상하는 것과 같을 수도 있고 그 이상이 될 수도 있다.\n"
"\n"
"하지만 이 책이 당신의 유일한 출입문이 되지는 못한다. 책에 쓰여진대로 마차나 배를 타고 북쪽으로 여행을 오라. 스카이림을 당신의 눈으로 볼 수 있을 것이다. 스카이림의 노드를 보라, 그들은 신이 세상을 만들 때 상상한 모습 그대로일 것이다."

"Argonians are scaled and of limited intelligence, and they are part of our everyday lives. In Morrowind and its surrounding regions, they're seen in every city and every town. They bring us our meals, they dress our children … but who are they, really?\n"
"\n"
"Argonians originate from the region known as the Black Marsh. A water-soaked and depressing land, it reeks of swamp gas and teems with insects. In their native land, the Argonians squat in fetid pools and worship primitive tribal gods. Their folk magics and simple tribal armies have never proven an adequate defense against men or mer of stout heart.\n"
"\n"
"The swamp was first pacified by the Cyrodilic army in 1E 2811. Those cruel and capricious men only entered the region to end the rule of a human bandit king. After the gauntleted hand of civilization came to the Argonians, their home served primarily as a prison state. The unthinking brutes of Cyrodiil callously released their most violent and unhinged criminals into the marsh.\n"
"\n"
"Almost six hundred years ago, Dark Elves entered the lives of this scaly servant race. As the Second Era dawned, we began working with the Argonians in earnest. Whole tribes were evacuated to the safety and dry climates of Vvardenfell, Stonefalls, and Deshaan. We offered them appropriate foodstuffs and taught them the ways of civilized culture. We fashioned garments to hide their more shameful features and sent them into the world, so they could learn and serve in new environs. In return for our generosity, we've asked so little of the Argonians! And yet, not all denizens of that fetid place feel true appreciation.\n"
"\n"
"Indeed, our time of close collaboration came to an end just a few years ago. A horrific disease known as the Knahaten Flu, brewed in the steamy depths of the marsh, spread across the region. Rumored to be the product of an Argonian tribal shaman, the plague struck all without reptilian ancestry, slaying uncounted numbers. Most tragically, other races began to fear the Argonians as spreaders of the plague. Our efforts to send Argonians on journeys of discovery were rebuffed at every turn.\n"
"\n"
"Today, of course, Argonians stand side-by-side with us in the Ebonheart Pact. Once they were merely our servants, but now, we have elevated this simple reptilian stock. They are strong, proud contributors to our military alliance and cared-for members of our households.\n"

"\n"
"아르고니안들은 원래 블랙 마쉬라고 알려진 지역 출신의 자들이다. 눅눅하고 음울하며, 벌레가 득실거리고 지독한 냄새가 나는 지역으로, 그들의 토착지역에서, 그들은 악취가 나는 물 에 쪼그려 앉아서 그들 부족이 믿는 원시부족 신을 숭배 하였다. 그들이 사용하는 일반적인 마법이나 그들의 소박한 군대들은 인간과 머들의 병사들을 막아낼 정도로 강인함(강인한 정신력)을 가지고 있지 않았다.\n"
"\n"
"제 1시대 2811년도에 시로딜 군대가 이 습지를 처음 점령했으며, 이 잔인하고 변덕스러운 인간들은 인간들을 상대로 노략질을 한 왕의 통치를 끝내겠다는 이유만으로 그 지역을 침입하였다. 문명의 손길이 아르고니안들에게 닫기 전까지, 그들의 고향은 죄수들이나 보내지는 곳으로 사용되었다. 그들은 시로딜의 무분별한 범죄자들, 그들의 가장 폭력적이고 불안정한 범죄자들을 모두 그들이 사는 습지로 보내곤 하였다.\n"
"\n"
"약 600여년 전 부터, 다크 엘프들은 이 비늘을 가진 하인 종족들의 생활에 개입하기 시작하였다. 제 2시대부터, 우리들은 본격적으로 아르고니안 들과 함께 일하기 시작하였다. 우리는 그들 부족들을 바던펠, 스톤폴즈, 그리고 데샨과 같은 건조한 기후로 이주시켰으며, 그들에게 적절한 음식을 제공했고 그들에게 문명과 문화에 대한것을 가르쳤으며, 그들의 매우 부끄러운 모습을 감추기 위해 옷을 그들의 문명에 전파하였다.\n"
"\n"
"그리고 그들이 새로운 환경에서 배우고 일할 수 있게 해주었다. 우리는 우리의 관대한 행위에 대해서, 아르고니안들에게 그 어떤작은 것도 요구하지 않았다! 그럼에도 불구하고, 그 악취나는 주민들 모두가 감사히 느껴하지 않았다. \n"
"\n"
"사실, 우리의 협력관계는 몇년전에 끝을 맞이하였다. 크나헤이튼 독감으로 알려진 무서운 질병이 습지의 깊은곳에서 부터 전 지역으로 퍼져나갔다. 한 아르고니안 샤먼에 손에 만들어 졌다는 소문이 있는 이 질병은, 아르고니안이 아닌, 다른 인종의 수많은  사람들을 죽음으로 몰아가기 시작하였고, 비극적이게도, 다른 종족들이 아르고니안들을 이 질병을 퍼트린 자들이라고 생각하며 그들을 배척하고 두려워 하였다. 우리는 그들을 발견의 여행에 보내고 싶었으나, 그럴때마다 매번 거절당하였고, 그들을 탐사에 보내겠다는 우리의 노력은 수포로 돌아갔다.\n"
"\n"
"물론 오늘날, 아르고니안들은 우리와 같은 에본하트 조약에 일원으로서 같이 서있다. 과거에는 단순한 하인에 불과했었지만, 이 단순한 파충류 가축들도 지위가 많이 상승한 것이다. 이제 그들은 우리의 군사 동맹에서 강력하고 자랑스러운 공헌자가 되었으며, 우리 가족의 구성원들도 잘 보살펴 주는 존재이다.\n"

"\n"
"Living in the Ashlands, you get used to life being hard. Angry kwama, poisonous fungus, tribal raiders—everything wants to kill you. Don't let them.\n"
"\n"
"I've compiled some notes on the Great Houses of the Dark Elves. Use them or don't. It's your decision. Just don't come crawling to Tel Verano if you find yourself in a Dres slave caravan.\n"
"\n"
"House Indoril\n"
"\n"
"If you're anywhere near the southern shore of the Inner Sea, House Indoril probably runs the show. The dogs of Almalexia control the most powerful house in Stonefalls and Deshaan. The Dres have money, and House Redoran has troops, but don't be fooled. The blue hats control the spiritual heart of the Ashlands.\n"
"\n"
"Have you seen their crest? It has wings, to let them fly far above us. That's how they see us: beneath them. Far beneath them. The military in Stonefalls is one of the most powerful in the region, and Indoril's war hero Tanval is right at the top.\n"
"\n"
"Loose Coins: Bribe Indoril troops before any others. They have the most clout. Don't try cracking temples. They're like fortresses. Anyone in Indoril robes has serious clout in Stonefalls and Deshaan. Look for easier targets.\n"
"\n"
"House Redoran\n"
"\n"
"Duty. Honor. Idiocy. Redoran has the common-folk thinking their house is the strong arm of the Pact. Whenever you see a group of Pact military officers in the field, they want you to think the most impressive hats belong to their noble house.\n"
"\n"
"The reality is somewhat different. Red hat troops do drive the Pact armies, but from the ground, not the top. Argonian scouts and Nord berserkers also command a lot of troops. The reason they try to slip this coin under the cup? Redoran nobles are still upset the Pact was formed in the first place. Their martial prowess looks a little thinner compared to Argonian stealth and Nord courage.\n"
"\n"
"To quote from one of their proverbs: \"Life is hard. Judge, endure, and reflect. A careless life is not worth living.\" That's all well and good until different-looking folks come along. Then it's time to lie and strut for the commoners.\n"
"\n"
"Loose Coins: Redoran troops are humorless, but greedy. Offer one enough, and he'd sell you his own mother. Never insult a Redoran to his face. In fact, never insult a Redoran. They have a tendency to hear things in the training yard. If you're going to pick a pocket, a Redoran is a good target. Just make good your escape, or you'll be meeting with the Three sooner than you planned.\n"
"\n"
"House Hlaalu\n"
"\n"
"You have to hand it to the Hlaalu. They actually walk the talk when it comes to Pact togetherness. It's not because they suddenly love our ancient enemies and slaves, though. No, Hlaalu's grandmaster is just smarter than most of the rest. An open hand makes it harder to notice the dagger behind your back. Am I right?\n"
"\n"
"While Indoril holds claim to the most powerful positions, Hlaalu has a snake's grip on Deshaan. Narsis is one of their greatest cities, and even in Mournhold, they have a lot of clout. Hlaalu public houses and plantations are everywhere south of Stonefalls. Learn their layouts well. A lot of the builders use the same plans over and over. When you learn the hiding places in one Hlaalu public house, you've learned them all. \n"
"\n"
"Loose Coins: Hlaalu troops are like kwama queens in Deshaan. Use that against them. Outside Deshaan, Hlaalu housemembers are likely to feel like they're standing in an ashstorm. No matter where you see them, yellow hats make good marks. Take them for all they're worth.\n"
"\n"
"House Dres \n"
"\n"
"You probably think you know the Dres, right? Heartless slavers with rigid class roles. Arrogant nobles who'd just as soon sell you as look at you.\n"
"\n"
"You're pretty much right. \"Don't cross Dres\" is a good bit of coin you can roll around in your head. I can hear you now, though. \"Tel, they have more money than they know what to do with.\" You're right again. Your average Dres noble has enough jewelry on display to tempt even the most seasoned cutpurse. \n"
"\n"
"Restrain your nimble fingers, friend. Dres justice doesn't bother with Ordinators or local guardsmen. You cross the Dres, you disappear. You're dead or a slave on some noble's plantation. \n"
"\n"
"Loose Coins: The coins are all tied up in a slavemaster's purse. Don't cross the Dres.\n"
"\n"
"House Telvanni\n"
"\n"
"There's only one good thing about this house of mages: they don't give a guar about the Pact. They only care about their sanctuary on the Telvanni coast. When the Pact formed, they got their robes in a twist and tossed out every other house trooper they could find. They're no friends of the lizards or the Nords. They wouldn't walk to the other side of the road to save another house's grandmaster. In short, they're the classic ivory tower wizards.\n"
"\n"
"Everything else about the brown hats is bad news. They move almost as many slaves as House Dres. To become a noble in House Telvanni, you need serious power. Look at a well-dressed brown hat the wrong way, and they'll melt your face off. They value fabulous magical treasures just as much as books you couldn't trade for a stale loaf of bread.\n"
"\n"
"Loose Coins: Rampaging Daedra couldn't make me assault a mage's tower, but if you're desperate to leave Nirn, I suggest buying armor enchanted against fire and frost. Then observe the tower as long as you can. If the mark has any magical defenses in place, he'll probably have to come outside to restore them. You might have better luck on the street, but examine your new loot carefully. Some treasures have their own defenses built in."

"\"드레스 가문과는 상종하지 마라\"라는 말이 머릿속에 떠오를 것이다. 하지만 이렇게 말하는 이도 있을 것이다. \"텔, 그들은 어떻게 써야 할지 모를 정도로 많은 돈을 가지고 있다고요.\" 그 말 또한 옳다. 평범한 드레스 귀족들은 가장 노련한 소매치기조차 신경써야 할 정도로 많은 보석들을 과시한다.\n"

"텔반니 가문\n"
"\n"
"이 마법사 가문의 좋은 점은 조약에 대해 불평하지 않는다는 점 뿐이다. 그들은 텔바니 해안에 있는 피난처에만 관심을 가진다. 조약이 체결되었을 때, 그들은 옷을 이상하게 입고 모든 기병들을 밖으로 내던져 버렸다. 그들은 도마뱀이나 노드의 친구가 아니다. 다른 가문의 지배자를 돕기 위해 길 밖으로 나가지도 않는다. 간단히 말해서, 전형적인 상아탑의 마법사들이다.\n"
"\n"
"그 밖에 갈색 모자에 대한 이야기는 안 좋은 것들 뿐이다. 그들은 드레스 가문에 맞먹을 정도로 노예를 부리고 있다. 텔반니 가문의 귀족이 되고 싶다면 강력한 힘이 필요하다. 잘 차려입은 갈색 모자를 잘못된 식으로 봤다간 얼굴이 녹아 버릴 것이다. 그들은 말라버린 빵 한 덩어리와도 바꿀 수 없는 책을 엄청난 마법적 유산들과 같은 가치로 여긴다.\n"
"\n"
"조언: 광란의 데이드라가 나에게 마법사의 탑을 공격하게 시키지는 못하였지만, 진심으로 넌을 떠나고 싶다면 화염과 냉기 방어 마법이 부여된 갑옷을 사는 것을 추천한다. 그리고 가능한 오랫동안 탑을 관찰하라. 마법 방어의 표식이 보인다면 수리하기 위해 밖으로 나가야 할 것이다. 길거리에서 행운이 따를지도 모르지만, 새로운 약탈품은 더 주의깊게 관찰하라. 보물들 중에는 방어의 힘이 깃든 물건도 있다.-OLD-"

"By Nili Omavel\n"
"\n"
"My fellow scholars would have you believe the Elves of the Ashlands are unstoppable. They point to Red Mountain and other triumphant, if hard-fought, battles against the Dwemer as proof. But once long ago, our people were as fair as a mountainside in Skyrim. In that distant time, we were driven to the edge of defeat.\n"
"\n"
"In the time before Red Mountain, we were known as the Chimer. We were just another race of mer eking out a living on the edge of the Inner Sea.\n"
"\n"
"Then came the Nedes. Though the Nords of today are allies, the Nedes were adversaries of the darkest nature. They sought only land, conquest, and spoils. We extended open hands of diplomacy, which they lopped off. Any Elf in the horde's path was fair game—man, woman, or child.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest generals of the age were brothers, Balreth and Sadal. They led armies of willing warriors against the horde. At first, this was an attempt to drive them from the ash. As the war went on, their actions turned purely to defense and redirection. If a force of Chimer could spend their blood allowing a village to evacuate, then that was blood well spent.\n"
"\n"
"The Nedes, after a few short years, controlled most of what we now call Stonefalls. The Chimer armies were cut off from the Inner Sea and reinforcements from Vvardenfell. The brothers retreated again and again until finally, they were left with a small elite force of sorcerers and troops. This force then took shelter in an ancient Daedric ruin.\n"
"\n"
"What happened at that ruin has been lost to time, but the massive statues that now mark the site endure as a mute testament. The death of the Chimer generals ended the war, but at what cost?\n"
"\n"
"At this ruin, the so-called Brothers of Strife were born. My research shows that Chimer mages from Vvardenfell eventually bound the beasts, but not before the Brothers ended the lives of hundreds of men and mer. One of the darkest chapters in our people's history followed. The unstoppable beasts made the ash run red with blood, Chimer and Nede alike.\n"
"\n"
"We can only speculate what brought the Brothers to Nirn. Perhaps a Daedric Prince summoned them to that ruin. Maybe it was Sheogorath having a laugh or a grim survival test from Boethiah. \n"
"\n"
"When the two beasts were finally bound into the twin spires of Stonefalls, they went to their rest with the blood of history staining their claws. We must hope and pray to the Three that their like will never be seen in the Ashlands again."

"Ghosts Walk Among Them\n"
"\n"
"The departed spirits of the Dunmeri, and perhaps those of all races, persist after death. The knowledge and power of departed ancestors benefit the bloodlines of Dunmeri Houses. The bond that forms between living family members and their immortal ancestors is partly blood, partly ritual, partly volitional. Anyone brought into a house through marriage is bound through ritual and oath into the clan, gaining communication and benefits from the clan's ancestors; however, his access to the ancestors is less than that of his offspring, and he still retains some access to the ancestors of his own bloodline.\n"
"\n"
"The Family Shrine\n"
"\n"
"Each residence has a family shrine. In poorer homes, it may be no more than a hearth or alcove where family relics are displayed and venerated. In wealthy homes, a room is set aside for the use of the ancestors. This shrine is called the Waiting Door, and represents the door to Oblivion.\n"
"\n"
"Here the family members pay their respects to their ancestors through sacrifice and prayer, through oaths sworn upon duties, and through reports on the affairs of the family. In return, the family may receive information, training, and blessings from the family's ancestors. The ancestors are thus the protectors of the home, and especially the precincts of the Waiting Door.\n"
"\n"
"The Mortal Chill\n"
"\n"
"Spirits do not like to visit the mortal world, and they do so only out of duty and obligation. Spirits tell us that the otherworld is more pleasant, or at least more comfortable for spirits than our real world, which is cold, bitter, and full of pain and loss.\n"
"\n"
"Mad Spirits\n"
"\n"
"Spirits that are forced to remain in our world against their will may become mad spirits, or ghosts. Some spirits are bound to this world because of some terrible circumstances of their death, or because of some powerful emotional bond to a person, place, or thing. These are called hauntings.\n"
"\n"
"Some spirits are captured and bound to enchanted items by wizards. If the binding is involuntary, the spirit usually goes mad. A willing spirit may or may not retain its sanity, depending on the strength of the spirit and the wisdom of the enchanter.\n"
"\n"
"Some spirits are bound against their wills to protect family shrines. This unpleasant fate is reserved for those who have not served the family faithfully in life. Dutiful and honorable ancestral spirits often aid in the capture and binding of wayward spirits.\n"
"\n"
"These spirits usually go mad, and make terrifying guardians. They are ritually prevented from harming mortals of their clans, but that does not necessary discourage them from mischievous or peevish behavior. They are exceedingly dangerous for intruders. At the same time, if an intruder can penetrate the spirit's madness and play upon the spirit's resentment of his own clan, the angry spirits may be manipulated.\n"
"\n"
"Oblivion\n"
"\n"
"The existence of Oblivion is acknowledged by all Tamriel cultures, but there is little agreement on the nature of that otherworld, other than it is the place where the Daedra live, and that communication and travel are possible between this world and Oblivion through magic and ritual.\n"
"\n"
"The Dunmer do not emphasize the distinction between this world and Oblivion as do the human cultures of Tamriel. They regard our world and the otherworld as a whole with many paths from one end to the other rather than two separate worlds of different natures with distinct borders. This philosophical viewpoint may account for the greater affinity of Elves for magic and its practices.\n"
"\n"
"Foreign Views of Dunmeri Ancestor Worship and Spirit Magic\n"
"\n"
"The Altmeri and Bosmeri cultures also venerate their ancestors, but only by respecting the orderly and blissful passage of these spirits from this world to the next. That is, Wood Elves and High Elves believe it is cruel and unnatural to encourage the spirits of the dead to linger in our world. Even more grotesque and repugnant is the display of the bodily remains of ancestors in ghost fences and ash pits. The presentation of fingerbones in a family shrine, for example, is sacrilegious to the Bosmer (who eat their dead) and barbaric to the Altmer (who inter the ashes of their dead).\n"
"\n"
"The human cultures of Tamriel are ignorant and fearful of Dark Elves and their culture, considering them to be inhuman and evil, like Orcs and Argonians, but more sophisticated. The human populations of Tamriel associate Dunmeri ancestor worship and spirit magic with necromancy; in fact, this association of the Dark Elves with necromancy is at least partly responsible for the dark reputation of Dunmer throughout Tamriel. This is generally an ignorant misconception, for necromancy outside the acceptable clan rituals is a most abhorrent abomination in the eyes of the Dunmer.\n"
"\n"
"The Dark Elves would never think of practicing sorcerous necromancy upon any Dark Elf or upon the remains of any Elf. However, Dark Elves consider the human and Orcish races to be little more than animals. There is no injunction against necromancy upon such remains, or on the remains of any animal, bird, or insect."

"그들과 함께 걷는 영혼\n"
"\n"
"던메리 (Dunmeri)의 죽은 영혼들은 다른 종족들과 마찬가지로, 죽은 후에도 여전히 살아 있다. 죽은 선인들의 지식과 힘은 던메리 가문의 가계에 보탬이 된다. 살아있는 가족과 조상을 연결하는 것은 피와 의식, 그리고 기도이다. 결혼을 통해서 새로 그 가족에 참여하는 사람은 의식과 가문에 대해 맹세를 함으로써 조상과 교류를 도모하고, 그들로부터 혜택을 받을 수 있게 된다. 그렇다고는 해도, 결혼해서 일족에 포함된 사람은 그 일족의 순수혈통인 사람과 비교하면 자신의 선조와의 연결은 다소 취약하고, 자기 자신의 조상과의 연결은 계속 유지한다.\n"
"\n"
"가문의 제단\n"
"\n"
"각 집에는 그 집의 제단이 있다. 궁핍한 집에서는 가족의 유품이 놓여 숭배할 만한 단순한 난로 선반 정도의 물건일지도 모른다. 부유한 집에서는 죽은 조상을 위한 전용 객실이 준비되어 있다. 이 제단은 조상을 '기다리기 위한 문'이며, 그들을 망각하기 위한 문을 의미한다.\n"
"\n"
"여기서 가족의 구성원은 공물을 바치거나 기도를 하며, 책무를 맹세한다, 가족과 관련된 일의 보고를 통해 선인들에게 경의를 표하는 것이다. 그 대가로 가족은 선인들로부터 정보를 받거나 가르침을 받으며, 축복을 주고받는다. 따라서, 선인들은 그들의 가정, 특히 '기다리는 문'의 경계선에서 수호자 역할을 하는 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"영혼 울타리\n"
"\n"
"가족이 지켜야 할 엄격한 관습 중에서 가장 중요한 것은 선인의 시체를 네크롬 (Necrom) 같은 사자의 도시에 매장하는 것이다. 여기에서는 영혼이 날 때부터 운명이 정해지는 사람 세계에 대한 두려움을 안락하게 맞이하는 것이다. 그러나 가문의 성지와 가족이 있는 주변을 보호하는 영혼 울타리의 일부로 이바지하기 위해 엄청난 영예와 공물의 증거로 시체 일부를 가지는 것도 허용된다. 이 계약에 관해서는, 대부분 가족의 의지에 의한 것이 많고, 유골에서 손가락 관절의 뼈가 뽑혀 엄숙한 마법이나 의식을 통해 일족의 유령 울타리에 포함되는 경우가 많다. 예외적으로, 유골 모두나 보존된 시체 자체가 영혼 울타리에 포함될 수도 있다.\n"
"\n"
"이 시체는 조상의 영혼, 특히 그 신체의 소유자였던 영혼에 표지판과 집합 장소의 역할을 한다. 많은 시체가 사용되고 있는 만큼, 그 영혼 울타리의 힘은 강해져서 살아있을 때 강한 사람의 경우에는 그 유해도 강력하게 된다.\n"
"\n"
"트리뷰날 (Tribunal)에 의해서 만들어진 브라이트 (The Blight)를 저지하기 위한 거대 영혼 울타리에는 또 하나의 가족으로 신전과 일족에게 영혼을 바친 신전영웅 인도릴 (Indoril) 가문이나 레도란 (Redoran) 가문의 뼈가 사용되고 있다. 또한, 유령 울타리에는 네크롬 지하 묘지와 모로윈드 전장에 있던 뼈도 많이 사용되고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"운명이 정해진 자의 전율\n"
"\n"
"영혼은 운명이 정해진 세계를 방문하는 것을 좋아하지 않고, 방문은 오직 의무감이나 책임감에 의한 것뿐이다. 영혼이 말하기를, 사후 세계는 즐겁고, 적어도 냉정하고 극심한 고통과 상실감이 넘치는 현실 세계보다는 기분이 좋다고 한다.\n"
"\n"
"미쳐버린 영혼\n"
"\n"
"자신들의 의사에 반해 우리의 세계에 머무를 것을 강요받은 영혼은 미쳐버린 영혼이나 유령이 될 가능성이 있다. 죽을 때의 상황이 비참했다는 이유이나, 사람이나 장소, 물건 등이 아주 강한 감정적인 관계가 있어서 머물고 있는 영혼도 있다. 이들을 '속박 영혼'이라고 부른다.\n"
"\n"
"마법사가 영혼을 마법의 항목에 묶는 때도 있다. 반드시 영혼 당사자가 원하는 것이어야 하며, 그렇지 않으면 그 영혼은 미쳐버린다. 마법을 통해 등장하는 것을 바라고 있던 영혼의 경우, 제정신을 유지할 수 있는지 유지할 수 없는지는 영혼 당사자가 가진 영혼의 힘과 마법을 사용하는 마법사의 지식에 달려 있다.\n"
"\n"
"이외에도 자신들의 의사와 반대로 가족 사원을 보호하기 위해 묶여 있는 영혼도 있다. 이 괴로운 숙명은 살아 있는 동안 가족에게 제대로 역할을 하지 못한 자에게서 일어난다. 비록 그가 충실하고 훌륭했어도 조상의 영혼은 말을 듣지 않는 영혼을 묶어버리기도 한다.\n"
"\n"
"이러한 영혼은 일반적으로 미쳐 버려, 무서운 수호자가 된다. 의식에 의해 그들은 가족에게 해를 주지 않게 되어 있지만, 그렇다고 해서 그들의 못된 장난이나 까다로운 태도를 완화할 수는 없다. 그들은 침입자에게 매우 위험한 존재이다. 그러나 침입자가 영혼의 분노를 간파하고, 그 영혼의 일족에 대한 분노를 잘 이용할 수 있으면, 그 화낸 영혼을 조종하는 것이 가능하게 된다.\n"
"\n"
"오블리비언\n"
"\n"
"오블리비언의 존재는 모든 탐리엘 문화로 인식되고 있지만, 그 별세계의 성질에 대해서는 다양한 설이 있다. 모두가 동의하고 있는 것은 에이드라와 데이드라가 사는 장소이며, 이 세계와 오블리비언은 마법과 의식을 통해 교류와 왕래를 할 수 있는 것 정도이다.\n"
"\n"
"던머는 이 세계와 오블리비언의 차이에 대해 탐리엘의 인간 문화만큼에 대해서 만큼이나 그다지 중요하게 여기지 않았다. 그들은 우리의 세계를 한쪽 세계를 다른 성질을 가진 명확한 경계에서 분할된 별도의 세계라고 생각하는 것이 아니라, 모두를 오갈 수 있는 여러 경로로 연결된 하나의 세계로 파악한다. 이러한 철학적인 관점이 있기 때문에, 요정은 마법과 그 실천에 높은 친화력을 가졌는지도 모른다.\n"
"\n"
"다른 종족에서 본 던메리의 선조 숭배와 정령 마법\n"
"\n"
"알트머족과 보스머족의 문화도 조상을 공경하는 풍습이 있지만, 이쪽의 세계에서 다른 세계로 통하는 질서있는 바람직한 방법은 바로 조상의 영혼을 다루는 것이다. 우드엘프와 하이엘프는 우리의 세계에 영혼을 만류하려고 하는 것은 잔인하고 자연에 반하는 것이라고 믿고 있다. 또한, 그들에게 유령 울타리와 재 안에 조상의 시체 일부를 사용하는 것은 기괴하고 불쾌한 행위로 여겨질 수 있다. 예를 들면, 가족의 성지에 손가락 마디뼈를 장식해 두는 것은 보스머 (시체를 먹는 종족)에게 모독적인 행위이며 알트머 (시체를 묻는 부족)에게는 야만적인 일이다.\n"
"\n"
"탐리엘의 인간은 다크엘프를 교양이 있다고 생각하지만, 오크와 아고니언과 같은 종족은 사악한 존재로 간주하고 있다. 그것은 그들과 그들의 문화에 대한 무지에서 비롯되며, 그것으로 말미암아 그들을 두려워하는 경향이 있다. 탐리엘의 인간은 던메리의 선조 숭배와 정령 마법은 사령술과 관련이 있다고 생각하고 있다. 실제로는 다크엘프와 사령술과의 관련성은 탐리엘에 퍼져 있는 던머와 관련된 은밀한 소문과 많이 연관된 것이다. 그러나 허용된 부족 이외의 의식 사령술을 하는 것이 던머가 가장 꺼리는 행위이기 때문에, 이것은 무지에 의한 오해일 수도 있다.\n"
"\n"
"다크엘프는 어떤 다른 다크엘프와도, 또 어떤 엘프의 시체든 사령술에 이용하고 싶다는 생각은 절대로 하지 않는다. 그러나 그들은 인간이나 오크 같은 종족은 동물과 큰 차이 없다고 생각하고 있다. 다크엘프는 그들이 생각하기에 동물로 여겨지는 종족의 시체, 또는 진짜 동물이나 조류와 곤충의 시체에 대한 사령술은 금지하지 않고 않다."

"One entity that came up again and again was a specter known only as \"The Bargain Man.\" Most merchants visibly paled at the mere mention of his name. Those who would talk about him did so only in whispers.\n"

"Apparently, the Bargain Man is a phantom that can be summoned to act as an intermediary between two remote business partners. When a contract is signed, the Bargain Man will conduct deliveries between the two parties, allowing goods to move great distances at a hare's pace. But as with all things, this service comes at a price. Should either party violate the terms of the contract, the Bargain Man metes out an \"appropriate\" punishment, then vanishes. \n"
"\n"

"\n"
"Background:\n"
"How this disease began and spread is a mystery. By gathering information, I hope to resolve the issue.\n"
"\n"
"Argonians appear immune to the flu. This has caused conjecture that they actually introduced the flu to retaliate for years of slavery at the hands of the Dark Elves. These claims have never been proven or disproven, and they require more research.\n"
"\n"
"Mitigation:\n"
"Methods that slowed the rapid spread of the flu included burning the belongings of infected people (which, unfortunately, sometimes including burning remaining family members); segregating the sick into ghettos (or walling them up); or putting the diseased onto ships and setting them adrift. Normal curative spells and elixirs were inconsistent in their ability to cure the flu. \n"
"\n"
"Symptoms and Course: \n"
"General malaise, loss of appetite, and fatigue begins several hours before an afflicted victim develops other symptoms. The afflicted person's eyes water constantly. Skin develops a bright red granular rash that does not itch. \n"
"\n"
"Within twenty-four to thirty-six hours, victims suffer nosebleeds, their tears contain blood, and a granular rash spreads over their bodies. At this point, victims develop a deep, raspy cough. Within thirty-six to forty-eight hours, the victims' coughs produce bloody phlegm. \n"
"\n"
"In most cases, death takes place in as little as seventy-two hours after the initial onset, but some victims have lingered for five to seven days.\n"
"\n"
"Treatment: \n"
"When the Knahaten Flu first spread, it seemed unstoppable. No reliable treatment against it has ever been proven.\n"
"\n"
"Ten years ago, a young Redguard named Perizada claimed she'd had a vision from the Divines. She replicated the cure from this dream, testing it on a village scheduled to be razed (together with its inhabitants). Her cure worked, and the village was saved.\n"
"\n"
"The cure required clannfear claws boiled in salt water. The patient would then drink the liquid. The increased trade of actual and purported clannfear claws on the black market caused prices to soar wildly. So many false cures had proven fatal that Perizada's cure was never officially sanctioned. As Perizada later died of the flu herself, its efficacy was eventually considered dubious at best.\n"

"The \"Clannfear Cure\" has given rise to many other supposed cures, all of which involve boiling something in a liquid and then drinking the result. For the poorest of the population, chicken broth proved not only cheap, but easily obtained. It typically soothed their coughs, which in turn allowed patients to breathe more easily. \n"
"\n"
"Chicken broth is definitely not a guaranteed cure, but it is certainly the most accessible. It is recommended, should this dread disease ever return.\n"
"\n"
"As the granular skin rash was non-irritating, many left it untreated. Those whose rash remained covered—whether in bandages, poultices, or simply clothing—seemed less likely to infect those who attended them. This also accounts for the much slower spread of the disease in colder climates and during winter months.\n"
"\n"
"Have you heard of other cures? If so, please submit your reports directly to me for further investigation."

"Hefting another bale into the loft, Maakul felt the pain shoot through his shoulder once more. He rotated his shoulder, shrugging to release tension.\n"
"\n"
"\"Thanks for your help,\" the Argonian trader said. He nodded at the Kothringi and lumbered away with his cart.\n"
"\n"
"For several months, the same trader came to Zuuk bearing loads of hay for the horses. Maakul's brother Huug, before he died, had handled the transactions. He arranged deliveries, unloaded the bales, and made payments. Then the illness struck Huug: a rash that stood out as bright spots against his skin together with a high fever. Within a week, he was gone.\n"
"\n"
"And now, Maakul dealt with the trader. If only his muscles didn't hurt so much. Clearly, he lacked the strength of his late brother. He'd need to try harder, though he preferred studying and reading to any physical labor.\n"
"\n"
"\"I need to check the ledgers anyway,\" Maakul said to himself as he headed into his hut. He'd let the books go during his brother's illness, and the latest delivery should be entered.\n"
"\n"
"As he opened the payment register, a slip of paper fluttered to the floor. He recognized his brother's handwriting and picked it up.\n"
"\n"
"\"Beware the ruby necklace.\" \n"
"\n"
"Maakul frowned. They couldn't afford necklaces, much less rubies. What did his brother mean? Shrugging, Maakul threw the crumpled note into the brazier beside his desk, draped a cloak over his legs, and settled down to bring their accounts up to date. He felt so cold.\n"
"\n"
"That night, Maakul saw his reflection in his wife's concerned face. She'd found him, coughing and shivering at his desk. She half-carried him to bed. A line of red welts, the tell-tale rash, encircled his throat.\n"
"\n"
"\"Rubies,\" he mumbled, clawing at his skin as the Knahaten Flu claimed its latest victim."

"Gold exchanged hands, marking the deal complete. Makes-Many-Waves belonged to a new master.\n"
"\n"
"Sendrasa Llarys watched as her newest acquisition joined the group she'd already purchased. She stared so long at Makes-Many-Waves that she drew the Argonian's eyes to hers. They both looked away quickly, almost instantly. Eye contact between master and slave would be punished by ten lashes.\n"
"\n"
"The distance between market and house was no more than seven miles, but it seemed an eternity to Sendrasa. She'd counted the years impatiently until she could set up her own household and bring Makes-Many-Waves home.\n"
"\n"
"\"Send the rest to the field house,\" Sendrasa said. Her footman assisted her from her horse. \"I want that one,\" she waved a hand towards Makes-Many-Waves, \"brought to my sitting room. She'll be my personal assistant.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"As you wish, madam.\"\n"
"\n"
"Pulling her gloves off as she strode into her home, Sendrasa laughed. \"Finally, yes! It will be exactly as I wish.\"\n"
"\n"
"How long since she'd felt her lover's lips pressed against hers? Shared in desperate, guilty caresses whenever they could steal away together? How she'd suffered once their intimacy became known! As though, Sendrasa thought bitterly, seeing her beloved sold through the Archeins hadn't been punishment enough.\n"
"\n"
"Time passed with deadly slowness from that moment until Sendrasa finally located Makes-Many-Waves and bought her back. This time, no one could separate them. They belonged together.\n"
"\n"
"The door opened, and Makes-Many-Waves stepped forward, eyes downcast becomingly. Sendrasa walked past her, shut and locked the door, then turned.\n"
"\n"
"\"I've missed you,\" she said softly.\n"
"\n"
"In a moment, they locked in a passionate embrace, Sendrasa touching Makes-Many-Waves's scales gently, searchingly.\n"
"\n"
"\"Did they torture you, darling? I swear they'll pay!\"\n"
"\n"
"Makes-Many-Waves shook her head, her frilled spine fluttering. \"Seeing you heals me, my love. But the Archeins ….\"\n"
"\n"
"\"You're safe. Those traitors won't touch you again,\" Sendrasa said.\n"
"\n"
"\"Listen, my love,\" Makes-Many-Waves said. \"Your parents paid the Archeins very, very well. Their eyes are everywhere. They'll know you bought me, and they'll come for me.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I'll free you,\" Sendrasa replied. \"You'll be safe!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"It's not like that,\" the Argonian whispered. \"The Archeins don't care whether Argonians they sell are free or not. To live together safely, we must leave Morrowind. \"\n"
"\n"
"\"I see. Now kiss me.\"\n"
"\n"
"As darkness approached, Sendrasa and Makes-Many-Waves began their journey, heading northwest toward the border with Skyrim.\n"
"\n"
"\"Is Riften safe?\" Makes-Many-Waves whispered. They'd traveled several days out of their way to shake off any possible followers.\n"

"Before Sendrasa could speak, an arrow pierced her throat. She clutched at it with one hand, her eyes widened in surprise. More arrows followed swiftly, killing the Dark Elf long before she slid to the ground.\n"

"\n"

"Torchlight caught in the misting snow gave the place an otherworldly quality. The soldiers from both camps found themselves huddled together around the largest of the bonfires: winter bringing enemies of four score years of warring close together. While only a few of the Dunmer guard could speak Cyrodilic, they found common ground battling for warmth. When a pretty Redguard maiden passed into their midst to warm herself before moving back to the treaty tent, many a man from both armies raised their eyes in approval.\n"
"\n"
"The Emperor Reman III was eager to leave negotiations before they had ever begun. A month earlier, he thought it would be a sign of good will to meet at the site of his defeat to Vivec's army, but the place brought back more bad memories than he thought it would. Despite the protestations of Potentate Versidue-Shaie that the rocks of the river were naturally red, he could swear he saw splatters of his soldier's blood.\n"
"\n"
"\"We have all the particulars of the treaty,\" he said, taking a glass of hot yuelle from his mistress Corda. \"But here and now is not the place for signing. We should do it at the Imperial Palace, with all the pomp and splendor this historic occasion demands. You must bring Almalexia with you too. And that wizard fellow.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Sotha Sil,\" whispered the Potentate.\n"
"\n"
"\"When?\" asked Vivec with infinite patience.\n"
"\n"
"\"In exactly a month's time,\" said the Emperor, smiling munificently and clambering awkwardly to his feet. \"We will hold a grand ball to commemorate. Now I must take a walk. My legs are all cramped up with the weather. Corda, my dear, will you walk with me?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Of course, your Imperial Majesty,\" she said, helping him toward the tent's entrance.\n"
"\n"
"\"Would you like me to come with you as well, your Imperial Majesty?\" asked Versidue-Shaie.\n"
"\n"
"\"Or I?\" asked King Dro'Zel of Senchal, a newly appointed advisor to the court.\n"

"\"That won't be necessary, I won't be gone a minute,\" said Reman.\n"

"Miramor crouched in the same rushes he had hidden in nearly eight months before. Now the ground was hard and snow-covered, and the rushes slick with ice. Every slight movement he made issued forth a crunch. If it were not for the raucous songs of the combined Morrowind and Imperial army gathered about the bonfire, he would not have dared creep as close to the Emperor and his concubine. They were standing at the curve in the frozen creek below the bluff, surrounded by trees sparkling with ice.\n"
"\n"
"Carefully, Miramor removed the dagger from its sheath. He had slightly exaggerated his abilities with a short blade to the Night Mother. True, he had used one to cut the throat of Prince Juilek, but the lad was not in any position to fight back at the time. Still, how difficult could it be to stab an old man with one eye? What sort of blade skill would such an easy assassination require?\n"
"\n"
"His ideal moment presented itself before his eyes. The woman saw something deeper in the woods, an icicle of an unusual shape she said, and darted off to get it. The Emperor remained behind, laughing. He turned to the face of the bluff to see his soldiers singing their song's refrain, his back to his assassin. Miramor knew the moment had come. Mindful of the sound of his footfall on the icy ground, he stepped forward and struck. Very nearly.\n"
"\n"
"Almost simultaneously, he was aware of a strong arm holding back his striking arm and another one punching a dagger into his throat. He could not scream. The Emperor, still looking up at the soldiers, never saw Miramor pulled back into the brush and a hand much more skilled than his slicing into his back, paralyzing him.\n"
"\n"
"His blood pooling out and already crystalizing on the frozen ground, Miramor watched, dying, as the Emperor and his courtesan returned to join the camp up on the bluff."

"레만 3세는 시작 하기도 전에 자리를 뜨고 싶어했다. 한달 전 비벡의 군대를 격파했던 곳에서 그를 만나기로 한 것이 좋은 징조가 되리라 생각했지만, 이 장소에 돌아오니 이곳에서 벌어졌던 악몽이 생생하게 되살아나 자신을 괴롭히고 있었다. 통치자 벨시듀 셰이가 이 강의 바위들이 자연적으로 붉은 색이라고 말하였지만, 황제는 강의 바위들을 붉게 물들인 것이 자신의 병사들의 피가 틀림없다고 확신하고 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"“협상의 자세한 사항은 이곳에 준비되어있소.”코르다로부터 뜨거운 유엘 한 잔을 받은 황제가 이야기 하였다. “하지만 지금 이곳은 조약을 맺을 만한 장소가 아니오. 임페리얼 궁전에서, 이 역사적인 행사를 장대하게 치러야겠소. 아말렉시아를 데려오시오. 그리고 그대들의 마법사 친구도.”\n"

"미라모어는 거의 여덟 달 전에 숨었던 것과 같은 덤불 속에 웅크렸다. 땅은 딱딱했고 눈으로 덮여 있었으며 덤불은 얼음으로 반드르르했다. 조금 움직이기만 해도 덤불이 부수어 져, 우두득거리는 소리가 났다. 모닥불 가에 모여 노래부르는 모로윈드와 임페리얼 군이 아니었다면 미라모어는 감히 황제와 그 정부에게 이렇게 가까이 다가가지도 못했을 것이다. 둘은 얼음으로 반짝이는 나무들에 둘러싸인 얼어붙은 개울이 휘도는 곳에 있었다.\n"
"\n"
" \n"
"조심스럽게, 미라모어는 칼집에서 단검을 빼들었다. 나이트 마더에게는 단검 실력을 약간 과장해서 말했었다. 황태자 쥘렉의 목을 따는 데 단검을 쓰기는 했지만, 그 청년은 당시 맞받아칠 여건이 전혀 아니었다. 하지만 외눈 늙은이를 찌르는 게 뭐 얼마나 어렵겠는가? 이렇게 쉬운 암살을 하는 데 무슨 검술이 필요하단 말인가?\n"
" \n"
"딱 알맞은 때가 눈앞에 절로 나타났다. 여자는 숲속에 특이한 모양의 고드름이 보였다고 말하고 그것을 가지러 뛰어갔다. 황제는 뒤에 남아 크게 웃었다. 황제는 개울가 앞쪽으로 돌아 자신의 병사들이 노래의 후렴구를 부르는 모습을 보았다. 등은 암살자에게 보인 채였다. 미라모어는 때가 왔음을 알아차렸다. 얼어붙은 땅을 딛는 발걸음 소리를 주의하며, 앞으로 나아가 습격했다. 거의 성공할 뻔했다.\n"
"\n"
"동시에 강한 팔이 단검을 쥔 미라모어의 팔을 뒤로 잡았고 다른 팔이 목에 단검을 쑤셔 넣었다. 미라모어는 비명을 지를 수가 없었다. 황제는 여전히 병사들을 바라보고 있었고, 미라모어가 덤불 속으로 끌려가 그를 뒤에서 공격했던 것보다 더 숙련된 손에 의해 마비되는 것을 보지 못했다.\n"
" \n"
"미라모어는 자신의 피가 울컥이며 나와 곧장 얼어붙은 땅 위에 얼음 결정이 되어가는 모습을 지켜보며 죽어갔고, 황제와 황제의 정부는 강가 절벽 위의 천막으로 돌아갔다."

"\"How can I sink in this?\" he asked aloud. \"I am of parents born in Black Marsh.\"\n"
"\n"
"When he could no longer move, Scale-Song bowed his head, listening to the moisture dripping from the roots twisted above him. Soon, it would be over. He would return to the Hist. How embarrassing, though, for an Argonian to suffocate in mud.\n"
"\n"
"His eyes opened suddenly. He'd had the same dream every night for weeks. Each night, he felt he was nearly at the cave's exit. Everything would be made clear once he reached it. And each morning, Scale-Song awoke, no closer to understanding the meaning of the imagery.\n"
"\n"
"\"Clearly, the Hist speaks to you,\" said his egg-brother Gash-Tail. \"Tonight, ask what it wants. Talk to it.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I'll try,\" said Scale-Song, \"but I never remember it's a dream until I'm awake.\"\n"

"The burnt incense filled his hut with thick gray smoke that coiled heavily along the ground like fog. Scale-Song hadn't expected it to smell so horribly. Still, he watched the smoke spread slowly throughout the room, his eyelids growing heavier and heavier.\n"
"\n"
"A cave. A tunnel? Smoke drifted along the muddy floor. Scale-Song stopped running and reached out a hand toward the smoke. Talk. Ask. Speak.\n"
"\n"
"\"Are you trying to tell me something?\" he asked aloud.\n"
"\n"
"\"I am dead.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Dead? Who are you?\"\n"
"\n"
"The smoke coalesced into a shimmering figure, hooded and cloaked. Its tail twitched. \"I am dead,\" the figure said. \"Without it, all that I am will be lost forever. Find it. Remember.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"It? What is it?\"\n"
"\n"
"Scale-Song followed the figure through the dark passage. His feet no longer sank into the mire, as in all the other dreams. They walked in silence. Scale-Song was alert, but untroubled.\n"
"\n"
"It seemed like hours before the pair reached the tunnel's exit. The shimmering figure sighed deeply, pointing toward a shriveled tree.\n"
"\n"
"\"A Hist,\" said Scale-Song, surprised. \"Is this it? Dead … but how?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Remember,\" said the figure, unfurling into the wind, but not before it pressed a Mnemic Egg into Scale-Song's hands."

"\"By the Eight,\" Lormingga whispered in horror. A scaled hand clamped across her mouth, preventing her from saying anything more.\n"
"\n"
"\"It's over,\" a voice rasped softly. A soft cloud of ash filled the air and she coughed, wondering why the assassin hadn't killed her, too.\n"
"\n"
"When the dust settled, Lormingga realized she was alone. Only the smear of blood on the floor beside her indicated where her companion had fallen. As her eyes adjusted to the darkness, Lormingga looked around carefully. Alone. She lifted her unbound hands to her face and prayed.\n"

"Lormingga felt the blade slipping through her flesh before she saw the Argonian rise beside her. Her mouth moved soundlessly and her hands clutched at where the weapon had pierced her throat.\n"
"\n"
"\"I had no proof you were involved, woman,\" the Argonian said, wiping her blade on  Lormingga's shirt before sheathing it. \"Thanks for admitting your guilt before I left. This journey would've been inconvenient for another Shadowscale to take so soon.\"\n"
"\n"
"As Lormingga sank to the floor, the Shadowscale assassin added, \"We are all part of the Pact now … except for traitors like you.\"\n"
"\n"
"And then the assassin, like Lormingga's life, was gone."

"A Request for Funding\n"
"\n"
"By Yngmaer Raven-Quill, Historian Royal of the Bards' College, Solitude\n"
"\n"
"Though we Nords of Western Skyrim, Your Majesty, were fortunate to escape involvement in the recent Akaviri invasion of Tamriel, it is nonetheless important that we try to understand this strange affair, especially as it has led our estranged kindred in Eastern Skyrim into a bizarre and ill-advised alliance with our ancient enemies, the treacherous Dark Elves of Morrowind.\n"
"\n"
"Though the events occurred only a dozen years ago, the facts of the incursion from Akavir are already becoming obscured by a fog of legend and conjecture. What do we know for sure?\n"
"\n"
"One: We know that there are multiple realms in Akavir, and that the raiders of the First Era (who later gave the Empire its Potentates) were from Tsaesci, while the forces of the recent invasion were from Kamal. However, we know virtually nothing about either realm.\n"
"\n"
"Two: The leader of this second invasion was the King of Kamal, Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal. We know little about him or his reasons for invading Tamriel, even from our agents in the Eastern Kingdom: few captured Akaviri knew any Tamrielic, and most died under interrogation. One report stated that Dir-Kamal was seeking someone or something called the \"Ordained Receptacle\"—but this could easily be a bungled translation.\n"
"\n"
"Three: For reasons unknown, the Akaviri fleet sailed around the northeast corner of Tamriel into the Sea of Ghosts, bypassing the Telvanni Peninsula, Vvardenfell, and Solstheim, before finally landing at the mouth of the White River northeast of Windhelm. \n"
"\n"
"Four: The invasion was a complete surprise, and Windhelm was invested before Queen Mabjaarn could muster the Hold in defense. After a brief siege the invaders breached the southern gate and the city was sacked and burned. Both Queen Mabjaarn and her daughter and heir, Princess Nurnhilde, were slain in fierce fighting before the gates of the Palace of the Kings. \n"
"\n"
"Five: The royal cadet, Prince Jorunn, escaped the sack of Windhelm and briefly disappeared. When he reappeared he was calling himself King Jorunn, and was accompanied by a mighty warrior whom he claimed was Wulfharth the Ash-King, sent back from Sovngarde to help the Nords defeat the Akaviri. With this so-called Wulfharth at his side, Jorunn rallied the Eastern Nords and fortified Riften. \n"
"\n"
"Six: When Dir-Kamal moved his army south from Windhelm, he bypassed Riften—once again, his motivations are unclear—and marched into western Morrowind. They were opposed by Dark Elf forces, who staged a fighting retreat through the Ashlands under the command of Almalexia and her leading general, Tanval of House Indoril.\n"
"\n"
"Seven: Dir-Kamal pursued the Dunmeri army into eastern Stonefalls, where the Elves halted their retreat by occupying prepared defenses. The Akaviri advance slowed and stopped—and suddenly, the Nord army under Jorunn and \"Wulfharth\" appeared in their rear. This cannot have been by chance: incredibly, we must conclude that, despite the age-old enmity between Nord and Elf, there was collusion between Jorunn and Almalexia, and the envelopment of the Akaviri at Stonefalls was according to plan.\n"
"\n"
"Eight: The Akaviri, however, were not easily defeated. With their backs to the Inner Sea, they fought a desperate defense, attempting to hold out until their ships could come from the White River estuary to take them from the shore. Despite repeated attempts, the combined Dunmer-Nord army failed to break their lines. The Akaviri fleet was actually visible on the northern horizon when another incredible event occurred: at the last moment the Nords and Dark Elves were reinforced by two legions of Argonians who had marched to the battle from the south. With the infusion of the reptilian Shellbacks, the Tamrielics finally broke the Akaviri line—and with nowhere to escape to, the invaders were slaughtered to the last soldier. \n"
"\n"
"As Your Majesty no doubt realizes, this account raises far more questions than answers: what we know about this affair is dwarfed by what we don't know. Thus my request to fund a Royal Committee of Inquiry to look into the grave implications of this matter. I, of course, will volunteer to lead this committee, provided the burden of such a task can be offset by an appropriate stipend."

"폐하, 저희가 서부 스카이림의 노드로서 최근 있었던 아카비리의 탐리엘 침공에 관여되는 것을 피하는 행운을 누리기는 했습니다만은, 저희가 이 기이한 사건을 이해하려 노력하는 것은 중요한 일입니다. 특히 저희의 소원한 일족들인 동부 스카이림의 노드들이 고대의 적들이었던 기만적인 모로윈드의 다크 엘프들과 연합을 결성한다는 특이하고도 경솔한 상황에 내몰렸다는 점에서 말입니다.\n"
"\n"
"그 사건은 고작 12년 전에 일어났지만, 아카비어에서 찾아온 기습에 대한 사실들은 이미 전설과 추측의 안개로 인해 그 실체가 모호해져가고 있습니다. 저희가 확실하게 아는 것들은 다음과 같습니다.\n"
"\n"
"하나: 저희는 아카비어에 다양한 왕국들이 있다는 것을 알고 있으며, 최근에 침략해온 군세는 카말에서 온 반면 제1시대의 침입자들(후일 제국의 권력자들을 배출한 자들)은 쎄이치에서 왔다는 사실을 알고 있습니다. 하지만 양쪽의 왕국에 대해서는 사실상 아는것이 없습니다.\n"
"\n"
"둘: 이 두 번째 침략의 지도자는 카말의 왕, 아다'숨 디어-카말이었습니다. 저희는 이 왕이나 그가 탐리엘을 침략한 이유에 대해서는 아는 것이 거의 없으며, 동부 왕국에 있는 저희의 요원들조차도 알아낸 것이 없습니다. 붙잡혔던 소수의 아카비리들은 탐리엘 언어를 전혀 몰랐으며, 대부분 심문 도중에 죽었습니다. 한 정기 보고서에 따르면 디어-카말이 \"서품받은 그릇\"이라고 불리우는 물건 혹은 사람을 찾고 있다고 하지만, 이는 서투른 번역일 가능성이 높습니다.\n"
"\n"
"셋: 알려지지 않은 이유로, 아카비리 함대는 탐리엘의 북동쪽 모서리를 빙 둘러 유령해로 항해하였습니다. 마침내 윈드헬름 북동쪽의 백강 하구에 상륙하기 전에 텔바니 반도, 바덴펠, 그리고 솔스타임을 우회한 것입니다.\n"
"\n"
"넷: 침략은 완전히 기습적이었으며, 윈드헬름은 마브잔 여왕이 영지에서 방어 벙력을 소집하기도 전에 포위당했습니다. 간단한 공성전 끝에 남부 관문이 돌파당했고, 도시는 약탈당하고 불타버렸습니다. 마브잔 여왕과 그 상속인이었던 딸 넌힐데 공주는 모두 왕들의 궁전 문앞에서 벌어진 격렬한 전투에서 살해당했습니다.\n"
"\n"
"다섯: 왕가의 아들인 요룬 왕자는 윈드헬름의 약탈에서 탈출한 뒤로 잠시 행방이 묘연해졌었습니다. 그가 자신을 요룬 왕이라 칭하며 다시 나타났을 때, 그 옆에는 자신을 잿더미왕 울프하스라고 칭하며 노드를 도와 아카비리를 물리치기 위해 소븐가드에서 보내졌다고 주장하는 강력한 전사를 대동하고 있었습니다. 이 소위 울프하스라는 자를 옆에 두고, 요룬은 동부의 노드들을 결집시켜 리프튼을 요새화했습니다.\n"
"\n"
"여섯: 디어-카말이 자신의 군대를 윈드헬름 남쪽으로 이동시켰을 때, 그는 리프튼을 우회하여(다시 한번 불명확한 동기로 움직였던 것입니다) 서부 모로윈드로 진군했습니다. 카말 군대는 다크 엘프 군대와 맞섰고, 다크 엘프들은 알말렉시아와 지휘를 맡은 인도릴 가문 소속 탄발 장군의 통제를 받아 재의 땅을 통과하며 후퇴전을 치렀습니다.\n"
"\n"
"일곱: 디어-카말은 던메리 군대를 스톤폴스 동부까지 추격했고, 그곳에서 엘프들은 후퇴를 멈추고는 미리 준비되었던 방어 시설에 들어갔습니다. 아카비리의 진군은 둔화되더니 멈춰버렸습니다. 그러더니 갑자기 요룬과 \"울프하스\"가 이끄는 노드 군대가 뒤쪽에서 나타났습니다. 이것은 우연히 일어날 수 있는 일이 아닙니다. 그 오랜 세월동안 노드와 엘프 사이에 이어져온 적대감에도 불구하고, 놀랍게도 요룬과 알말렉시아 사이에 공모가 있었고, 스톤폴스에서 이루어진 아카비리의 포위는 계획에 따라 행해진 일이었다는 결론을 내릴 수밖에 없는 것입니다.\n"
"\n"
"여덟: 그러나 아카비리는 쉽게 패배하지 않았습니다. 내해를 등진 채 필사적으로 방어하며 백강 어귀에서 출발한 자신들의 선박이 해안가에 도착할 때까지 버티려 했던 것입니다. 던머와 노드의 연합 군대는 반복되는 시도에도 불구하고 아카비리의 방어선을 뚫어내는데 실패했습니다. 아카비리 함대가 북쪽 수평선에 실제로 모습을 드러내기 시작했을 때, 또 다른 놀라운 사건이 일어났습니다. 그 최후의 순간에 남쪽에서 행군해온 두 개의 아르고니안 부대가 노드와 다크 엘프들을 지원하러 왔던 것입니다. 이 파충류 등껍질전사들이 투입되어 마침내 탐리엘인들은 아카비리의 방어선을 돌파하였습니다. 그리고 탈출할 곳이 없어진 침략자들은 그 마지막 병사까지 모두 학살당했습니다.\n"
"\n"
"폐하께서도 의심의 여지 없이 인식하셨겠지만, 위의 설명은 해답보다는 훨씬 더 많은 질문을 던져주고 있습니다. 저희가 이 사건에 대해 알고 있는 것들은 저희가 모르는 것들에 비하면 하찮은 것입니다. 따라서 저는 왕립 연구 위원회에 자금을 조달하여 이 문제의 결과에 대한 심도있는 탐구를 시작할 것을 요청하는 바입니다. 물론 저는 이 위원회를 이끄는 일에 자원할 것입니다. 이러한 과업의 부담이 적절한 봉급으로 상쇄된다면 말입니다."

"Mages Guild Report: The Order of the Black Worm\n"
"\n"
"It is as we feared, Archmagister: the Order of the Black Worm is no mere Daedric cult, but a brotherhood of necromancers that seeks to rival—nay, supplant—our own Mages Guild. \n"
"\n"
"Even as the Mages Guild was founded by the ex-Psijic Vanus Galerion, so was the Worm Cult founded by his arch-rival and nemesis, the ex-Psijic Mannimarco. Both were trained on the Isle of Artaeum, but when Galerion got Mannimarco expelled for his dabbling in forbidden necromantic arts, the self-styled Worm King simply relocated to continental Tamriel and took up his heinous pursuit in earnest. He is known to have sought out hidden manuscripts describing how the Dragon Priests enthralled their draugr, ancient Ayleid tablets regarding the summoning of spirits of the dead, and the Crimson Book of Skulls, which Shalidor himself had thought destroyed. Mannimarco has bragged of consorting with Daedra Lords, and may even have bargained with the Father of Vampires, Molag Bal himself. \n"
"\n"
"Mannimarco then set about spreading his blasphemous lore, enlisting unscrupulous mages, outcast witches, and vile Reachmen into his necromantic network. He dubbed his new cult the Order of the Black Worm, in emulation—or perhaps mockery—of the monastic orders of the Divines. In most parts of Tamriel, raising the dead was quite properly considered an atrocity, so the Worm Cult at first operated entirely as an underground, illicit organization. But Mannimarco, in addition to being a mighty necromancer, is a wise and wily diplomat, and in many jurisdictions he's persuaded, bribed, or intimidated the authorities into turning a blind eye to the Order's activities. \n"
"\n"
"Worse, in Cyrodiil, the King of Worms has even persuaded the ruling Tharns of the Imperial City to declare necromancy a legal magecraft, and the Order of the Black Worm has now taken the place of the Mages Guild as the authorized magical advisors to the Imperial Throne.\n"
"\n"
"A typical cell of the Order, known informally as a \"Worm Nest,\" is led by a necromancer who bears the title \"Worm Anchorite.\" An Anchorite reports directly to Mannimarco, though their means of communication is as yet unknown. Beneath the Anchorite are Necromancer Adepts, Worm Warriors, and lackeys called Worm Thralls. New cultists are attracted by promises of great power for those who serve loyally, and all are sworn to secrecy on pain of Undeath.\n"
"\n"
"Regional plots are addressed in the secondary reports. An additional overheard rumor, unconfirmed at this time, is that the Order has opened negotiations with the Sloads of Thras. I am seeking further information, and may know more by the next dark of the moons.\n"

"모두가 알다시피 메이지 길드는 전 시직오더이신 바누스 갈레리온에 의해 설립되었습니다. 그리고 벌레 교단은 전 시직오더의 일원이자, 그분의 최대 라이벌이였던 매니마코에 의해 창립되었죠. 둘 다 아르테움 섬에서 교육을 받았지만, 매니마코는 금지된 마법 네크로맨싱에 손을 대었고, 갈레리온님께서는 이를 밝혀 낸 뒤 그를 추방시켰습니다. 그 이후 그는 탐리엘 대륙으로 이동 하여 자신을 벌레들의 왕이라 칭하며, 추악한 짓들을 본격적으로 벌이기 시작하였습니다. 그는 드래곤 프리스트들이 어떻게 드라우그들을 사로잡았는지가 서술된 문서의 사본을 만든뒤 숨겨두었고, 죽은 자의 영혼을 어떻게 소환 하는지가 적혀있는 고대 에일리드 석판, 그리고 샬리도어가 파괴했다고 전해지던 해골의 크림슨 북을 찾아낸것으로 알려져있습니다. 매니마코가 데이드릭 군주들과의 친분을 자랑하기도 하더군요. 그러니 그가 흡혈귀들의 시조라 불리는, 몰라그 발과 거래했을 가능성도 있습니다.\n"
"\n"
"그 이후 매니마코는 그의 신앙 모독적인 전승을 전파하는 일에 착수하였고, 무절제한 마법사들, 버림받은 마녀들, 그리고 비열한 네크로맨서들을 모아 네크로맨서 연결망을 만들고 음모를 퍼트리기 시작하였습니다. 그는 디바인들을 따르는 수도승들과 대앙하는 의미로 —아니 어쩌면 조롱 하려는 의도 일수도 있겠군요— 검은 벌레 교단이라 이름지었습니다.\n"
"\n"
"탐리엘 대부분의 지역에서, 죽은 사람을 소생시키는 행위는 매우 부적절하며 잔혹한 행위로 알려져있습니다, 때문에 초창기 검은 벌레 교단은 보지이 않는 곳에 숨어서 활동하는 불법적이고 비밀스러운 조직으로 운영되었습니다. 하지만 매니마코는 강력한 네크로 맨서이자, 영리하며 교활한 외교가였지요. 그는 많은 지역에서 설득을 하였고, 정부 당국에 뇌물을 주고, 매수하거나 협박하였기 때문에, 권위자들은 교단의 활동에 눈을 감게 되었습니다.\n"
"\n"
"설상가상으로, 시로딜에서, 벌레들의 왕은 왕실의 임페리얼 시티의 '탄'에게 네크로 맨서들이 합법적인 마법사로 인정받을 수 있도록 설득하고 선언하게 하였으며, 이 후 제국 왕실의 마술 고문으로서 메이지 길드 원이 아닌 검은 벌레 교단의 일원이 대신하도록 설득하였고 이에 성공했습니다. \n"
"\n"
"비 공식적으로 \"벌레의 보금자리\"라고 알려진 그의 네크로맨서 하위 조직은 \"벌레의 은자\"라는 타이틀을 가진 자가 이끌었습니다. 연락을 어떤 식으로 주고 받는 지에 서는 알려지지 않았지만, 은자는 매니마코와 직접적인 연락을 주고받는다고 합니다. 은자의 지배 아래에는, 숙련된 네크로맨서들과 , 벌레 전사들 그리고 벌레 노예들이 있습니다. 새로운 신자들은 위대한 힘의 약속에 매료되어 있으며, 불멸에 고통에 대한 비밀을 지킬것을 맹세 한다고 합니다.\n"
"\n"
"지방에 대한 보고는 2차 보고서에 기재해두었습니다. 더불어서 우연히 들은 소문에 의하면, 현시점에서는 자세히 알 순 없지만, 교단이 타라스의 슬로드들과 협상을 시작 했다는 이야기가 있습니다. 더 많은 정보를 찾고 있으며, 다음번 달이 어두워 질 때는 더 많은 정보를 찾아 올 생각입니다.\n"
"\n"
"보고서를 작성한 이는 수행자 퀘리타티스입니다 아케이께서s— 그의 영혼을 에이테리우스로 인도해 주시길— 이 보고서는 그의 사후에 에보커리 브루시엘이 작성하였습니다."

"Today Mezhun observed several Horker-Tusk tribesmen engaged in what he thought was a disgusting practice. They gorged themselves on boar meat and then forced themselves to vomit the food back up into their bowls. This one was truly shocked, however, when the riekr then traded bowls and ate their fellow tribesmen's vomit. Mezhun lost his own lunch at the sight of this, but Master Sterone was enthralled. He insists this behavior is indicative of a high-level of tribal intimacy. He even suggested that the riekr were more civilized than we are in this respect. This one has so much to learn.\n"
"\n"
"25th Frost's Fall\n"
"For several days, it seemed as if the riekr were going to allow Mezhun to travel freely within the cavern, but that all changed last night. King Umezeduluth invited this one to dance with him. Mezhun was nervous, but Master Sterone insisted that this was an incredible opportunity. The dance was fast and strange, but things were going well until the king became obsessed with this one's fur. He seemed to appreciate its warmth and began making gestures suggesting he wanted a coat made out of it. Mezhun was startled and pulled away, which seems to have driven the king into a rage. The riekr have since kept this one across the cavern and prevented him from going very far. Master Sterone says everything will be fine if Mezhun simply cooperates. This one hopes he will someday have as much wisdom and patience as Master Sterone."

"Noble Families of Cyrodiil, Volume Seventeen\n"
"\n"
"By Count Opius Voteporix\n"
"\n"
"House Tharn of Cheydinhal is one of the most distinguished noble families of northern Nibenay, where they have held extensive estates since early in the First Era. The family may, as they claim, be as old as the First Era itself: as house historians like to point out, there is a \"Tharanus Ye Redde-Hand\" mentioned in the Tamrilean Tractates of 1E 200. In those days before Alessia's Slave Rebellion, this proto-Tharn was apparently a slave overseer employed by the Ayleid Elves of Fanacas, a mining hold in the hills north of modern-day Cheydinhal. Based upon the fact that the Ayleids were known to have kept business records in red ink, the Tharn historians posit that this \"Redde-Hand\" was probably literate and employed in some clerical capacity. To be thorough, I will mention Lady Euphemia Glaber's theory that identified this Tharanus with the notorious \"Tharhan the Mutilant\" of the Gradual Massacre in 1E 227, but this was completely disproved by the text of the \"Scroll of Precursor Saints\" discovered in the vaults below the White-Gold Tower by Chancellor Abnur Tharn in 2E 541.\n"
"\n"
"House tradition holds that the Tharn family was active in St. Alessia's slave uprising, with one Vilius Tharn serving Pelinal Whitestrake as \"Blade-Serrator and Master of the Abbatoir.\" But the next Tharn who can definitely be identified in the historical record is Fervidius Tharn of the Alessian Order, who was Arch-Prelate of the Maruhkati Selective from 1E 1188 until his death (exact date indeterminate). Fervidius is best-remembered today as the author of the \"Sermons Denouncing the Seventeen Leniencies.\"\n"
"\n"
"Noble Tharn captains led mercenary companies that fought on both sides in the War of Righteousness in the 2300s, and when the dust settled General Turpis \"Volte-Face\" Tharn was in possession of the broad holdings that the family today calls home. Taking the title Earl of Outer Cheydinhal, Turpis married a niece of Admiral Bendu Olo and set about fathering numerous descendants. \n"
"\n"
"Several generations of Tharns served nobly and well during the Reman Empire, including Regulus Tharn, who revived the tradition of Imperial Battlemages, and Excoraeus Tharn, Emperor Kastav's Minister of Punition.\n"
"\n"
"Which brings us to the members of the Tharn family of our own, current day. First and foremost, of course, is the head of the house and longtime Chancellor of the Elder Council, Abnur Tharn. Through times of trouble and the change of emperors, the Chancellor has always been there to provide the continuity and consistency our Imperial civilization needs. \n"
"\n"
"Second only out of respect for her elder is Her Majesty Clivia Tharn, Empress Regent of Cyrodiil, and daughter of Abnur Tharn by his seventh wife, Pulasia. Empress Clivia, it need hardly be said, is the widow of two emperors, having been the consort of both Leovic and Varen. \n"
"\n"
"Scarcely less powerful is the Chancellor's younger half-sister, Euraxia Tharn, who has been Queen of Rimmen since the Frostfall Coup in 2E 576. And what would social events in the Imperial City be like without the presence of her son, the droll and charming Javad Tharn? \n"
"\n"
"Truly, House Tharn has come to epitomize the modern Nibenese nobility. We can only hope that they will continue to be with us through the future, whatever it may bring. \n"

"Emperor Varen! How briefly you blazed across our sky, like a skymetal shard shining out to light our way through the darkness!\n"
"\n"
"Noble Varen! Devout Varen! Varen Aquilarios! Son of a Colovian duke, paragon of physical prowess, wily fox of strategic cunning, you sought to restore our Empire to the glory of the Days of the Remans. You showed us the way. If only we, your subjects, had been worthy of the challenge you presented us!\n"
"\n"
"When Leovic sat upon the Ruby Throne, you urged your fellow Colovians to be loyal to their Emperor, despite his eccentricities. It was only when Leovic, misled by wicked councilors, declared worship of the Daedric Princes legal and protected in the Empire, that you cried, \"Enough!\" and took up your righteous sword.\n"
"\n"
"And the Colovians rose behind you! After an initial defeat at the hands of the Emperor's troops at Fort Ash, you took command of the Legion of Chorrol and sent Leovic reeling back into the Heartland. Word spread that Cyrodiil had a savior, and that Reman's true heir had come at last. The Colovian Estates rose as one under your dragon banner, and eastward you marched.\n"
"\n"
"The war that followed was bitter and terrible, replete with stunning victories, desperate gambits, and reversals on both sides. The might of the Imperial Legions, bolstered by Reachman auxiliaries and Daedric magic, were almost impossible to overcome. But you, Varen, had the might of right on your side! Finally you fought your way to the Imperial Palace and cut down Leovic in the Imperial Throne Room.\n"
"\n"
"But alas, our Emperor Varen, you wore the Amulet of Kings for all too short a time. It is said that your ambition for restoring your people to greatness led you to plumb secrets of the Divines best left untouched. Why did you leave us, O Varen, on that night of storms and trembling terrain, and where did you go? Surely you are dead, for you would not leave your people so bereft if yet you lived.\n"

"by The Arch-Mage Salarth\n"
"\n"
"The idea of a collection of Mages, Sorcerers, and assorted Mystics pooling their resources and talents for the purpose of research and public charity was a revolutionary concept in the early years of the Second Era. The only organization then closest in aim and structure to what we know today as the Mages Guild was the Psijic Order of the Isle of Artaeum. At the time, magic was something to be learned by individuals, or at most within intimate covens. Mages were, if not actually hermits, usually quite solitary.\n"
"\n"
"The Psijic Order served the rulers of Summerset Isle as counselors, and chose its members through a complex, ritualized method not understood by outsiders. Its purposes and goals likewise went unpublished, and detractors attributed the worst evils as the source of the Order's power. Actually, the religion of the old Order could be described as ancestor worship, an increasingly unfashionable philosophy in the Second Era.\n"
"\n"
"When Vanus Galerion, a Psijic of Artaeum and student of the famed Iachesis, began collecting magic-users from around Summerset Isle, he attracted the animosity of all. He was operating out of the urban center of Firsthold, and there was a common (and not entirely unfounded) attitude that magical experiments should be conducted only in unpopulated areas. Even more shocking, Galerion proposed to make magical items, potions, and even spells available to any member of the general public who could afford to pay. No longer was magic to be limited either to the aristocracy or intelligentsia.\n"
"\n"
"Galerion was brought before Iachesis and the King of Firsthold, Rilis XII, and made to state the intentions of the fraternity he was forming. The fact that Galerion's speech to Rilis and Iachesis was not recorded for posterity is doubtless a tragedy, though it does afford opportunity for historians to amuse one another with speculation about the lies and persuasions Galerion might have used to found the ubiquitous organization. The charter, at any rate, was approved.\n"
"\n"
"Almost immediately after the Guild was formed, the question of security had to be addressed. The Isle of Artaeum did not require force of arms to shield it from invaders—when the Psijic Order does not wish someone to land on the Isle, it and all its inhabitants simply become insubstantial. The new Mages Guild, by contrast, had to hire guards. Galerion soon discovered what the Tamrielic nobility has known for thousands of years: money alone does not buy loyalty. The knightly Order of the Lamp was formed the following year.\n"
"\n"
"Like a tree from an acorn, the Mages Guild grew branches all over Summerset Isle and gradually the mainland of Tamriel. There are numerous records of superstitious or sensibly fearful rulers forbidding the Guild in their domains, but their heirs or heirs' heirs eventually recognized the wisdom of allowing the Guild free rein. The Mages Guild has become a powerful force in Tamriel, a dangerous foe if a somewhat disinterested ally. There have been only a few rare incidents of the Mages Guild actually becoming involved in local political struggles. On these occasions, the Guild's participation has been the ultimate decider in the conflict.\n"
"\n"
"As begun by Vanus Galerion, the Mages Guild as an institution is presided over by a supreme council of six Archmagisters. Each Guildhall is run by a Magister, assisted by a twofold council, the Perquisitor and the Master Palatinus, who is also the leader of the local chapter of the Order of the Lamp.\n"
"\n"
"One need not be a member of the Mages Guild to know that this carefully contrived hierarchy is often nothing more than a chimera. As Vanus Galerion himself said bitterly, leaving Tamriel to travel to other lands, \"The Guild has become nothing more than an intricate morass of political infighting.\""

"시직오더는 서머셋에서 조언가로서 그들의 지도자들을 보필하였다. 그리고 그들은 다른이들이 이해할수 없는 복잡하고 종교적인 방법을 통해 일원을 뽑았다. 마찬가지로 그들의 목적과 목표 또한 대중들에게 공개되지 않았고, 이로인해 중상가들은 시직 오더의 힘은 사악한 악으로부터 얻어진다고 여겼다. 하지만 사실, 옛 시직 오더의 종교는 제 2 시대에는 유행하지 않던 철학인 조상 숭배라 묘사될 수 있다.\n"
"\n"
"아르테움의 시직이자 존경받는 이아케시스의 학생인 바누스 갈레리온이 서머셋의 마법을 쓰는 자들은 모으기 시작했을 때, 모든 이들의 반발 하였다. 그시절 마법적인 실험은 오직 사람들이 없는 곳에서만 행해져야 한다는 일반적인(그리고 전혀 근거없지 않는) 사고방식에 반해 갈레리온은 퍼스트홀드의 중심에서 활동하였다, 더욱 충격적인 것은, 갈레리온이 마법물품, 약품, 게다가 주문서를 돈이 있기만 한다면,혹은 필요 한 일반인들에게 팔기로 하였다는 것이다. 마법이 더이상 귀족들과 지식인들의 전유물이 아니게 된 것이다.\n"

"이아케시스와 퍼스트홀드의 왕, 릴리스12세 (Rilis XII)에게 불려간 갈레리온은 그가 만들고 있는 집단의 의도를 설명하여야 했다. 갈레리온이 릴리스왕과 이아케시스에게 말한 내용이 후대를 위해 기록되지 않았던 사실은 - 현재의 메이지길드의 구조를 만들기 위해 갈레리온이 한 거짓말과 설득을 역사가들이 추측하는 기회를 줄수있긴 했지만 – 여지없이, 안타까운 것이다. 어찌되었든 갈레리온의 릴리스왕과 이아케시스을 설득하여 허가를 받았다.\n"
"\n"
"메이지길드가 설립된 후 길드의 보안성에 대한 의문이 떠올랐다. 아르테이움 섬은 딱히 침략자를 대비하기위해 군대가 필요하지않는다 - 시직오더가 누군가가 섬에 닿는 것을 원치않는다면, 섬과 섬의 모든것이 환상으로 변하기 때문이다. 하지만 새로 설립된 메이지 길드는 경비병을 고용해야만 했다. 그리고 갈레리온은 곧 탐리엘 귀족들이 몇천년 동안 알고있던 사실을 발견했다: 돈만으로는 충성심을 사지못한다. 이후 다음해 등불의 기사단 (The knightly Order of the Lamp)이 만들어졌다. \n"

"Dinieras-Ves, \"The Iron,\" initially believed that the entirety of the order should be composed of Akaviri. This belief of his is not disputed by any historian, though his motivation is often debated. The traditional, simple explanation is that he knew his countrymen well, trusted them, and felt that their tradition of fighting for profit would be of use. Others believe, with reason, that he and the Potentate sought to use the order to effectively complete the conquest of Tamriel begun over five hundred years earlier. When Akavir attacked Tamriel in the 2703rd year of the First Era, they had been beaten back by the Reman Dynasty. Now they had a Potentate on the throne, and with Dinieras-Ves' machinations, the local armies would also be Akaviri. What they had failed to do by combat, they would have successfully accomplished by patience. Many scholars suggest this was a traditional stratagem of the immortal snake men, the Tsaesci of Akavir, who always had time on their side.\n"
"\n"
"The point, however, is largely academic. Though the Syffim did establish themselves in some kingdoms neighboring Cyrodiil, it became quickly apparent that local warriors were needed. Part of the problem was simply that there were not enough Akaviri for the work that needed to be done. Another part was that the snake men did not understand the geography and politics of the regions they were assigned.\n"
"\n"
"It was evident that some non-Akaviri were needed in the Syffim, and by the mid-point of the year, three Nords, a warrior-sorceress, a rogue, and a knight were admitted into the order.\n"
"\n"
"The knight, whose name has been lost in the sands of time, was also a great armorer, and probably did more to strengthen the organization than anyone but Dinieras-Ves himself. As has often been stated, the Akaviri, particularly the Tsaesci, understood weaponry better than armor. Even if they could not wear it themselves, the knight was able to explain to the other Syffim the weaknesses in their opponents' armor, explaining to them how many joints there were in a pauldron and a greave, and the differences between Aketons and Armkachens, Gorgets and Gliedshrims, Palettes and Pasguards, Tabards and Tassettes.\n"
"\n"
"With this knowledge, they made long strides in defeating the brigands, doing far better than their meager numbers would suggest. It is a joke among historians that if Akavir had had a Nord armorer in their employ in the First Era, they would have won the invasion.\n"
"\n"
"The success of these first three outsiders to the Syffim opened the door for more local members. Before the year was through, Dinieras-Ves had spread his business throughout the Empire. Young men and women joined this new order en masse for a variety of reasons, including desperate poverty, love of action and adventure, or simply to aid their crime-stricken neighbors. They received training and were immediately put to work helping the aristocracy's problems, assuming the roles of guards and soldiers within their locality.\n"
"\n"
"The early success of the Syffim in combating crime and defeating local monsters so inspired Potentate Versidue-Shaie that he entertained representatives from other organizations interested in Imperial sanction. Though formed much earlier, the Mages Guild had always been viewed with suspicion by the government. In the 321st year of the Second Era, the Potentate gave his approval to the Guilds Act, officially sanctioning the Mages, together with the Guilds of Tinkers, Cobblers, Prostitutes, Scribes, Architects, Brewers, Vintners, Weavers, Ratcatchers, Furriers, Cooks, Astrologers, Healers, Tailors, Minstrels, Barristers, and the Syffim. In the charter, they were no longer called the Syffim, however: bowing to the name it had become known as by the people, they were to be called the Fighters Guild. All the Guilds, and those that followed by later sanctions, would be protected and encouraged by the Empire of Cyrodiil, recognizing their value to the people of Tamriel. All would be required to pay to expand their influence throughout the land. The Empire was strengthened by their presence, and the Imperial coffers were filled once again.\n"
"\n"
"Shortly after Versidue-Shaie's death, only three years after the Guild Act, his heir Savirien-Chorak allowed the reforming of local armies. The Fighters Guild was no longer the principal arm of the local aristocracy, but their worth had already been established. Though there were certainly strong individuals who sought their own fortunes in the past, many historians have suggested that Dinieras-Ves was the ancestor in spirit of the modern phenomenon of the Adventurers, those men and women who dedicate their lives to questing for fame and fortune.\n"
"\n"
"Thus, all owe a debt of gratitude to the Fighters Guild—not only its members, but also the people who have been helped by its neutral policy of offering strong arms for a fee within the boundaries of the law.

"\"강철\" Dinieras-Ves는 초기에 조직전체가 아카비리 (Akaviri)로 구성되어야 한다고 믿었었다. 그의 이러한 믿음은 어떠한 역사가에 의해서도 이의제기를 받지 않았지만, 그의 동기는 자주 논쟁거리가 되었다. 전통적으로 단순한 설명은, 그가 그의 국민들을 잘 알고 있었으며, 그들을 신뢰하고 있었고, 유용한 이익을 위해 싸우는 그들의 전통에 감화되었다는 것이다. 또다른 근거있는 믿음은, 그와 군주는 5백년 전부터 시작된 탐리엘의 정복을 효과적으로 완수하기 위한 조직을 찾고 있었다는 것이다. 아카비어 (Akavir)가 첫번째 연대의 2703번째 해에 침입해왔을 때, 그들은 리만왕조 (Reman Dynasty)에 의해 격퇴되었었다. 디니에라스 베스 (Dinieras-Ves)의 책모로, 그들이 왕좌의 군주가 되었을 당시, 지방군들은 아카비리 (Akaviri)로 바뀌었다. 그들이 실패한 것은 전투에 의한 것이었고, 그들은 인내심으로 성공적인 성취를 이루었었다. 많은 학자들이 말하는 것처럼, 아카비어 (Akavir)의 Tsaesci인인 불사의 뱀인간들의 전통적인 전략은 언제나 시간이 그들의 편이라는 점이었다.\n"
"\n"
" 그러나 요점은 거대한 대학이었다. 비록 사이핌 (Syffim)이 시로딜 이웃의 몇몇 왕국들에서 설립되어졌지만, 상황은 각 지방의 전사들이 요구되어지는 형태로 빠르게 변화되어갔다. 문제의 일부는 간단히 말해서, 임무 수행에 필요한 아카비어인들의 수가 충분하지 못하다는 것이었다. 다른 문제는 뱀인간들이 그들이 소속된 지방의 지형과 정치를 이해하지 못한다는 것이었다.\n"
"\n"
" 그 해의 중간쯤에 세명의 노드와 한명의 전투마법사, 한명의 로그, 한명의 기사 들이 조직에 참여함으로써, 몇몇 비아카비어인들 (non Akaviri)이 사이핌에 필요하다는 것이 명백해졌다. \n"
"\n"
" 시간의 모래속으로 사라져버린 이름의 그 기사는 또한 상당한 대장장이였고,  Dinieras-Ves 를 제외하곤 어느 누구보다 조직을 보다 튼튼하게 만들었다. 자주 이야기 되어지듯이, 전형적인 Tsaesci인처럼 Akaviri는 아머보다 무기를 잘 이해했다. 설령 그들이 그들 스스로 이해하지 못하더라도, 그 기사는 적군들의 아머에서 약점이 무엇인지에 대해서, 그리고 pauldon 과 pauldon에 얼마나 많은 관절들이 있는지에 대해서,  Aketons 과 Armkachens, Gorgets 과  Gliedshrims, Palettes 과 Pasguards, Tabards 과 Tassettes 사이의 차이점에 대해 다른 사이핌 (Syffim)에게 설명할수 있었다. \n"
"\n"
" 이같은 지식으로, 그들은 약탈자들을 패배시키는 커다란 발걸음을 만들었고, 그들의 불충분한 숫자를 넘어서는 일들이 제안되어졌다. 역사가들 사이의 농담으로, 만약 첫번째 연대에 아카비어인들이 노드 아머러를 고용했었다면 그들은 그 침공에서 승리했을 것이라고 한다.\n"
"\n"
" 사이핌에서 이들 첫번째 외부인들의 성공은 보다 많은 지방 회원에 대한 문을 열어놓게 했다. 그 해가 지나기 전에  디니에라스 베스 (Dinieras Ves)는 그의 사업을 제국 전역에 확장시켰다. 다양한 이유로- 극도의 가난, 활동과 모험에 대한 동경, 범죄에 고통받는 이웃을 구하기 위해서 - 젊은 남녀들이 그의 새로운 조직에 합류했다. 훈련받은 그들은 즉시 귀족들의 문제를 돕기위한 일이나, 그 지역내의 경비대와 군대의 역할을 대신하는 일에 투입되어졌다. \n"
"\n"
" 범죄와의 전투와 지방 몬스터들의 격퇴에 있어서 사이핌의 초기 성공은 군주 베르시듀 쉐이어 (Versidue-Shaie)를 크게 고무시켜, 그가 제국의 재가에 관심이 있는 다른 조직들로부터 대표자들을 받아들이게 했다. 보다 일찍 조직되었음에도 불구하고, 메이지 길드는 항상 정부에 의해 의심스러운 시선으로 바라봐져왔다.  두번째 연대 321번째 해에, 군주는 공식적으로 메이지 길드를 재가함으로써, 땜장이, 구두수선공, 매춘부, 서기, 건축가, 양조자, 포도주상인, 직조공, 쥐잡이꾼, 요리사, 점성가, 모피상인, 치료사, 제단사, 시인,변호사, 그리고 사이핌 등, 모든 길드들에게 길드법령에 대한 그의 승인을 허가했다. 이 특허장에서 그들은 더이상 사이핌으로 불리지 않았다, 그러나 :  사람들에게 잘 알려진 이름을 따른, 파이터 길드라고 불리워졌다. 두번째와 세번째 연대기를 통해 후에 허가되어진 이같은 모든 길드들은 시로딜 제국에 의해 보호되어지고 격려받으면서, 탐리엘 사람들에게 그들의 가치를 깨닫게 했다. 모든 길드는 이땅 전역에서 그들의 영향을 확대하기 위해 댓가를 요구받는다. 제국은 그들의 존재에 의해 강력해졌고, 제국의 금고는 다시 한번 채워지게 되었다.\n"
"\n"
" Versidae-Shaie가 죽은 후 얼마되지않은, 길드법령 후 단 3년만에 그의 계승자 Savirien-Chovak는 지방군대의 재구성을 허가했다. 파이터길드는 더 이상 지방귀족의 중요한 군대는 아니었지만, 그들의 가치는 이미 확고부동한 것이었다. 확실히 과거엔 그들 자신의 부를 구하기 위한 강한 개인들이었지만, 많은 역사가들은 Dinieras-Ves가 모험가들의 현대적모습의 정신적 조상이라고 말한다. 그들 남녀들은 명예와 부에 대한 추구로 그들의 삶을 헌신한다. \n"
"\n"
" 그러므로, 모두는 파이터 길드에게 감사의 빚이 있다. -- 길드의 멤버들뿐만 아니라, 법의 경계 안에서 자유롭게 강력한 무장을 제공하는 중립정책에 의해 도움 받은 사람들까지도. 그들이 없었다면, 어떠한 종류의 길드도 없었을 것이고, 아마 논쟁이 되겠지만, 독립적인 모험가들을 위한 모델도 없었을 것이다. "

"In the 283rd year of the Second Era, Potentate Versidue-Shaie was faced with a disintegrating empire. The vassal kingdoms throughout Tamriel had reached a new height of rebellion, openly challenging his rule. They refused his taxes and led sorties against the Imperial garrisons throughout the land. At the destruction of his fortress in Dawnstar, he gathered the Imperial Council in what would be called the Council of Bardmont, after the town south of Dawnstar where they met. There the Potentate declared catholic and universal martial law. The princes of Tamriel would dissolve their armies or face his wrath.\n"
"\n"
"The next thirty-seven years were perhaps the bloodiest in the violent history of Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"In order to crush the last of the royal armies, Versidue-Shaie had to sacrifice many of his best legions, as well as spend nearly every last piece of gold in the Imperial treasury. But he accomplished the unthinkable. For the first time in history, there was but one army in the land, and it was his own.\n"
"\n"
"The problems that immediately surfaced were almost as staggering as the triumph itself. The Potentate had impoverished the land by his war, for the vanquished kingdoms had also spent the last of their gold in defense. Farmers and merchants alike had their livelihood ruined. Before the princes of Tamriel would not pay his taxes—now, they could not.\n"
"\n"
"The only persons who benefited from the war were criminals, who preyed upon the ruins of the lawless land, without fear of arrest now that all the local guards and militia were gone. It was a crisis the Akaviri had seen coming long before he destroyed the last of his subjects' armies, but for which he had no solution. He could not allow his vassals their own armies again, but the land was deeper into the stew of anarchy than it had ever been before. His army sought to fight the rise of crime, but a central authority was no threat against the local underworld.\n"
"\n"
"In the dawn of the year 320, a kinsman of Versidue-Shaie, Dinieras-Ves, \"The Iron,\" presented himself with a host of companions before the Potentate. It was he who suggested an order of mercantile warriors-for-hire, who could be hired by nobility in lieu of a standing army. The employment would be temporary, and a percentage of their fees would go to the Potentate's government, thus putting salve on two of Versidue-Shaie's greatest pains.\n"

"Though it was then called the Syffim, after the Tsaesci word for \"soldiers,\" the organization that was to be known as the Fighters Guild had been born."

Dawnstar에서 그의 초소가 파괴되자, 베르시듀 쉐이어 (Versidue Shaie)는 Bardmont 의 의회를 소환하는 제국의회를 소집하였고, 그들이 만난 장소는 Dawnstar 의 남부 마을 뒤였다. 그곳에서 군주는 포괄적이고 통합적인 계엄령을 선포하였다. 탐리엘의 영주들은 그들의 군대를 해산하거나 아니면 그의 분노에 맞서야 했다.\n"

"\n"
" 즉시적으로 떠오르게 된 문제들의 대부분은 성공 그 자체만큼이나 심각했다. 군주는 그가 일으킨 전쟁으로 인해 영토를 불모의 땅으로 만들어 버렸고, 정복된 왕국들은 방어를 위해 그들의 모든 재정을 쏟아부었었다. 농부와 상인들은 황폐화된 그들의 생계와 비슷한 처지였다. 전에 탐리엘의 영주들은 세금을 내지 않으려 했지만, 이제 그들은 낼 수 있는 능력조차 없었다.\n"

"Frontier, Conquest, and Accommodation: A Social History of Cyrodiil\n"
"\n"
"By University of Gwylim Press, 2E 344\n"
"\n"
"Historians often portray the human settlement of Tamriel as a straightforward process of military expansion of the Nords of Skyrim. In fact, human settlers occupied nearly every corner of Tamriel before Skyrim was even founded. These so-called \"Nedic peoples\" include the proto-Cyrodilians, the ancestors of the Bretons, the aboriginals of Hammerfell, and perhaps a now-vanished human population of Morrowind. Strictly speaking, the Nords are simply another of these Nedic peoples, the only one that failed to find a method of peaceful accommodation with the Elves who already occupied Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"Ysgramor was certainly not the first human settler in Tamriel. In fact, by \"fleeing civil war in Atmora,\" as the Song of Return states, Ysgramor was following a long tradition of migration from Atmora; Tamriel had served as a \"safety valve\" for Atmora for centuries before Ysgramor's arrival. Malcontents, dissidents, rebels, landless younger sons, all made the difficult crossing from Atmora to the \"New World\" of Tamriel. New archeological excavations date the earliest human settlements in Hammerfell, High Rock, and Cyrodiil at ME 800-1000, centuries earlier than Ysgramor, even assuming that the twelve Nord \"kings\" prior to Harald were actual historical figures.\n"
"\n"
"The Nedic peoples were a minority in a land of Elves, and had no choice but to live peacefully with the Elder Race. In High Rock, Hammerfell, Cyrodiil, and possibly Morrowind, they did just that, and the Nedic peoples flourished and expanded over the last centuries of the Merethic Era. Only in Skyrim did this accommodation break down, an event recorded in the Song of Return. Perhaps being close to reinforcements from Atmora, the proto-Nords did not feel it necessary to submit to the authority of the Skyrim Elves. Indeed, the early Nord chronicles note that under King Harald, the first historical Nord ruler (1E 113-221), \"the Atmoran mercenaries returned to their homeland\" following the consolidation of Skyrim as a centralized kingdom. Whatever the case, the pattern was set. In Skyrim, expansion would proceed militarily with human settlement following the frontier of conquest, and the line between Human territory and Elven territory was relatively clear.\n"
"\n"
"But beyond this \"zone of conflict,\" the other Nedic peoples continued to merge with their Elven neighbors. When the Nord armies of the First Empire finally entered High Rock and Cyrodiil, they found Bretons and proto-Cyrodiils already living there among the Elves. Indeed, the Nords found it difficult to distinguish between Elf and Breton, the two races had already intermingled to such a degree. The arrival of the Nord armies upset the balance of power between the Nedic peoples and the Elves. Although the Nords' expansion into High Rock and Cyrodiil was relatively brief (less than two centuries), the result was decisive; from then on, power in those regions shifted from the Elves to the humans."

" 역사가들은 탐리엘의 인류정착을 말할때, 그것을 자주 스카이림 노드의 군사적인 확대 과정으로 묘사한다. 사실은, 스카이림이 발견되기 전에 이미 시로딜의 대부분 지역에 인간들이 존재하고 있었다. 소위 \"네딕 주민들\" 이라는 말은, 시로딜 원주민, 브리튼 종족의 조상들, 해머펠의 토착민, 그리고 아마 지금은 사라져버린 모로윈드의 인간들을 모두 포함하는 말이다. 엄격히 말하자면, 노드인들은 이 \"네딕 주민들\" 의 한 종류이며, 이들은 이미 탐리엘을 장악하고 있던 엘프들과 평화로운 공존의 방법을 찾는데 실패했다.\n"
"\n"
"이스그래머가 탐리엘에 정착한 첫 인간 정착민은 아니었다. 사실은, 귀환의 노래에서 언급한 것에 따르면, \"아트모라 내전에서 패배하여\" 라는 구절에서, 이스그래머는 오랫동안 전해지던 전설을 따라 아트모라에서 이주하고 있다. 이스그래머가 탐리엘에 도착하기 전에도 이미 탐리엘은 수 세기 동안 아트모라에 대한 \"안전 지대\"를 제공해 주고 있었던 것이다. 불평분자, 반체제 인사, 도둑, 갈 곳 없는 젊은이들, 이들 모두는 탐리엘의 \"새로운 세상\"을 향하여 아트모라에서부터 어려운 횡단을 시도했다. 새로운 고고학적 발굴은 해머펠, 하이락, 그리고 시로딜에서 인간이 정착한 가장 빠른 시기를 신화 시대 800-1000년으로 보고 있으며, 이것은 이스그래머는 물론이고, 심지어 해럴드가 역사적으로 등장하는 12명의 노드 \"왕\"의 시기에 대한 가정보다 수 세기나 빠른 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"네딕 주민들은 엘프들의 땅에서 소수민족이었기 때문에, 이 오래된 종족과 함께 평화롭게 살아가야만 했다. 하이락, 해머펠, 시로딜, 그리고 모로윈드에서 그들은 그렇게 했고, 신화시기의 마지막 세기에 접어들면서 번영과 확대를 가져오게 되었다. 귀환의 노래에 기록된 것에 따르면, 단지 스카이림에서만 이러한 공존이 깨어졌다. 노드인들은 스카이림에서 엘프들의 지배권을 인정할 필요성을 느끼지 않았다. 최초의 역사적 노드 통치자인, 해럴드 왕 (1E 113-221)의 지휘 아래, 그들의 고향으로부터 돌아온 아트모라 용병들은 이곳에서 핵심적인 왕국으로서 자리잡기 위해 스카이림의 합병을 시도했다고 초기 노드 연대기에 기록되어 있다. 어찌되었건, 스카이림에서 이러한 패턴이 고착되어지면서, 확장이 군사적인 성격을 띄게 되었고, 인간 정착민들이 정복에 의한 개척지를 추구하기 시작하면서 인간 영토와 엘프 영토 사이의 경계선은 비교적 명확해졌다.\n"
"\n"
"그러나 이 \"분쟁 지역\"  너머에서는, 또 다른 네딕 주민들이 그들의 엘프 이웃들과의 합병을 꾀하고 있었다. 첫 제국의 노드 군대들이 마침내 하이락과 시로딜에 진입했을 때, 그들은 이미 엘프들과 함께 살고있는 브리튼과 시로딜 원주민들을 발견했다. 노드인들은 엘프와 브리튼, 이 두 종족이 이미 어느정도 섞여버렸기 때문에 둘 사이의 차이점을 구별하기가 힘들었다. 노드 군대의 도착은 엘프와 네딕 주민들 사이의 힘의 균형을 깨뜨리게 했다. 비록 하이락과 시로딜에서 노드인들의 확장은 비교적 짧은 기간이었지만, 그 결과는 아주 중요한 것이었다. 이것을 기점으로 하여, 이 지역의 패권은 엘프로부터 인간들에게로 넘어가게 되었다."

Vivec sought out experiences that tested him in every way possible, particularly in the defense and protection of his Dunmer people, and through his long life, his humility, and his unconquerable spirit, he attained the Wisdom of the Seven Graces. The Cantatas relate many stories of Vivec's experiments with challenge and risk, his failures and triumphs, his blessings of insight and good fortune, and his debt to his partners, Almalexia the Lover and Sotha Sil the Teacher.

"\n"
"Anyone can become an enchanter—it doesn't matter who you are, or who you were. I spent twenty years pulling fish from the waters of Black Marsh before stumbling into the world of enchanting. If a former Argonian fisher-slave can figure it out, so can you!\n"
"\n"
"Step One: Find Runes\n"
"\n"
"Years ago I noticed glowing runes when I fished in Black Marsh. At first I thought they were wisps! You're most likely to find them in dangerous places, so be careful. Look for the angular stones where the runes sit.\n"
"\n"
"—Red Aspect runes remind me of fish: the minnows are plentiful but don't have much flesh on their bones, while the old grandfathers are the rarest but the richest catch.\n"
"—Blue Potency runes make me think of a fish's flavor. The good ones can improve your day, while the bad ones are best fed to your enemies. \n"
"—Green Essence runes are like the type of fish. Frost fish, armor fish, poison fish … you get the idea.\n"
"\n"
"Some people ask me why there are runes scattered throughout Tamriel, but that's a question for the Mages Guild. I've never asked where fish come from, just where I can find more of them.\n"
"\n"
"(I should mention—I can't actually see colors. If you're like me, you want to look for the brightness of the rune. Aspect runes are quite dim, potency runes are bright, and essence runes glow very bright.)\n"
"\n"
"Step Two: Create Enchantment\n"
"\n"
"Once you have one rune each of aspect (fish age), potency (fish flavor), and essence (fish type), bring them to an enchanting station. Now, put the runes together and craft your first enchantment!\n"
"\n"
"The best way you learn to fish is by fishing, and the same applies to enchanting. The act of creating an enchantment will reveal the meaning and function of unknown runes. Some will say \"You must comprehend how the rune resonates with your soul to truly understand it,\" but that's Mages Guild talk.\n"
"\n"
"Step Three: Enchanting Items\n"
"\n"
"You have your first enchantment. Now you're ready to enchant your first item! Find the item you want to enchant and apply the enchantment. Easy, no? But of course, it's never that easy.\n"

"Enchantments are very particular. Some are best for weapons, others for armor, and still more bind only to jewelry. Some may require higher quality items than what you have on hand. Oh, and if you change your mind later you can re-enchant an item, but adding a new enchantment will remove the old one. \"Serve the right fish for the right occasion,\" as my egg-sister says.\n"

"누구나 마법부여가가 될 수 있다. 당신이 누구인지, 아니면 누구였는지는 중요하지 않다. 나는 마법부여의 세계에 굴러들어오기 전에는 20여년간 블랙 마쉬의 물가에서 생선을 낚던 사람이었다. 전직 아르고니안 노예 어부가 할 수 있다면, 당신도 할 수 있을 것이다!\n"
"\n"
"첫 번째 단계: 룬을 찾기\n"
"\n"
"나는 몇 년 전 블랙 마쉬에서 낚시를 하다가 빛나는 룬을 발견했다. 처음에는 그게 도깨비불인줄 알았다! 룬을 가장 쉽게 찾을 수 있는 곳은 위험한 곳이니 조심해야 한다. 룬이 있는 각진 돌들을 찾아라.\n"
"\n"
"—붉은 애스팩트 룬은 생선을 떠올리게 한다. 피라미는 많이 잡히기는 하지만 뼈에 붙은 살이 많지가 않다. 그 반면 늙은 할아버지 생선은 가장 희귀하지만 가장 값 나간다.\n"
"—파란 포텐시 룬은 생선의 맛이 생각나게 한다. 좋은 생선은 당신의 하루를 즐겁게 만들어 준다. 그 반면 나쁜 생선은 적들에게 먹이기에 최고다.\n"
"—녹색 에센스 룬은 생선의 종류와도 같다. 서리 물고기, 방어구 물고기, 독 물고기... 이해했을 거라고 생각하겠다.\n"
"\n"
"어떤 사람들은 왜 룬이 탐리엘 전역에 흩어져 있는지 묻지만, 그건 메이지 길드에 해야 할 질문이다. 나는 생선이 어디에서 오는지 절대 묻지 않는다. 어디서 더 많이 찾을 수 있는지를 물을 뿐이다.\n"
"\n"
"(이건 언급해야겠는데, 난 사실 색을 보지 못한다. 만약 당신이 나와 비슷하다면 룬의 밝음을 살펴야 할 것이다. 애스펙트 룬은 꽤 어둑하고, 포텐시 룬은 밝으며, 에센스 룬은 아주 밝게 빛난다.)\n"
"\n"
"두 번째 단계: 마법부여 물품 만들기\n"
"\n"
"애스팩트 (생선의 나이), 포텐시 (생선의 맛), 그리고 에센스 (생선의 종류) 룬을 하나씩 얻었다면 그것들을 마법부여 제작대로 가져가라. 이제 룬을 함께 놓고 첫 번째 마법부여 물품을 제작하는 것이다!\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"낚시를 가장 잘 배우는 방법은 낚시를 하는 것이다. 마법부여도 마찬가지다. 마법부여 물품을 제작하는 행동은 알려지지 않은 룬의 의미와 기능을 밝혀줄 것이다. 누군가는 \"룬을 진정으로 이해하려면 룬이 당신의 영혼에 어떻게 공명하는지를 이해해야 한다.\"라고 말하겠지만, 그건 메이지 길드가 하는 소리다.\n"
"\n"
"세 번째 단계: 장비에 마법부여하기\n"
"\n"
"당신은 첫 번째 마법부여 물품을 얻었다. 이제 첫 번째 장비에 마법부여를 할 준비가 된 것이다! 마법부여 하고 싶은 장비를 찾아서 마법부여를 하면 된다. 쉽지 않은가? 물론 그렇게 쉽지는 않다.\n"
"\n"
"마법부여는 아주 까다롭다. 어떤 것은 무기에, 다른 것은 방어구에 가장 좋으며, 장신구에만 묶여 있는 것들도 있다. 어떤 것들은 당신 손에 있는 것보다 더 좋은 품질의 장비가 필요할 수도 있다. 참, 그리고 나중에 마음이 바뀐다면 마법부여를 다시 할 수 있다. 하지만 새로운 마법부여를 더하면 이전 것은 사라질 것이다. \"알맞은 생선을 알맞은 곳에 써라.\" 내 알 자매가 한 말이다.\n"
"\n"
"부록: 마법부여 물품에서 룬 추출하기\n"
"\n"
"쓸 수 없는 마법부여 물품이 있어도 체념하지 말라! 팔거나, 거래하거나, 아니면 그걸 쓸 수 있는 친구에게 선물할 수도 있으니까.\n"
"\n"
"물론 아무 마법부여 제작대에서 룬을 추출해낼 수도 있고 말이다. 나는 이 과정을 \"생선 배 가르기\"라고 부른다. 이 과정에서 마법부여 물품은 파괴되지만, 다른 마법부여에 사용할 수 있는 룬을 얻을 수 있을 것이다."

"by You Know Who\n"
"\n"
"My dear apprentice, you have destroyed far too many of my alchemical stocks to go unpunished. My own master would never abide such abject incompetence! \"Can't take instruction,\" she'd say. \"Nose in a book,\" she'd say. Luckily for your prospects, it is far less costly to write this simple manual than replace yet another cask of rare solvent.\n"
"\n"
"If you lose this manual, as I know you will, don't despair. I have invested your annual stipend toward printing multiple copies of this book and distributing them far and wide. In time, every alchemy station in Tamriel shall have one.\n"
"\n"
"Step One: Acquire Solvents\n"
"\n"
"You already know that every potion requires a solvent to serve as the potion's base. If you ever paid attention to my lessons, you'd know the best solvent is clean water from a natural source. The purity of the water determines the quality of the potion, so the best sources are natural springs.\n"
"\n"
"I must once again emphasize the need for fresh sources of water. Remember that incident with the healing draught? You cannot simply dip a flask into a stagnant pond, an ocean cove, or downstream from a tannery. I suppose you could find bottles of clean water about town, but it is best to do the work yourself.\n"
"\n"
"Incidentally, your \"rain barrel solvent\" will never work. You are to cease your experiments immediately.\n"
"\n"
"Step Two: Acquire Reagents\n"
"\n"
"Alchemy is a study of combinations. Where solvents are a potion's base, reagents are the active ingredients. Each reagent bears four unique traits. I'm disinclined to explain the principles of quadratic amalgamation to you—again—but do try to remember the basics: match like with like.\n"
"\n"
"Henceforth, you are to find all reagents in the wilds—not in my laboratory! Remember to look for plants and mushrooms. Plants and mushrooms, only! Under no circumstances should you deviate from this. \"Squirrel powder\" was an abomination against the Eight.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, I must remind you to thoroughly clean both mortar and pestle after their use.\n"
"\n"
"Step Three: Craft Potions\n"
"\n"
"Bring a solvent and two reagents to any alchemy station. Different reagents are required, a fact I must stress once again. Combining bugloss with bugloss gets you nothing but foul-tasting water.\n"
"\n"
"When you have what you need, put them together and craft your potion. Reagents with positive trait combinations will produce helpful potions, while those with negative trait combinations can cause harm to whoever is foolish enough to imbibe them. If none of your reagents' traits match, you lose both solvent and reagents.\n"
"\n"
"Experiment with different reagents to see what you can produce. I leave it to you to determine their traits, but will remind you that ingesting a reagent can teach you its most basic trait. Just one—don't gorge yourself!\n"
"\n"
"While I recall of it, did you expect I wouldn't know you'd finished off the nirnroot? I could hear your teeth singing, and there's no way to hide a glowing chamberpot.\n"
"\n"
"Advanced Alchemical Principles\n"
"\n"
"Only when you master the basics of alchemy should you think to complicate the process. Through careful study you can learn to suppress negative traits when crafting potions, craft multiple potions from the simple set of reagents, or even combine additional reagents to produce more powerful potions! \n"
"\n"
"But for now, \"not poisoning yourself\" is the goal I'd most like you to achieve."

"내 친애하는 제자야, 넌 내 연금술 물품 재고를 엄청나게 많이 날려먹었는데도 벌받지 않았지. 내 스승님께선 그런 절망적인 수준의 무능을 참지 않으셨을 거란다! \"가르침을 거스르지 마라.\" 내 스승님께서 하신 말이다. \"책에 머리를 박아라.\" 이것도 스승님께서 하신 말이지. 네 장래성에는 운 좋게도, 이 간단한 설명서를 쓰는 편이 희귀 용매 통을 또 하나 교체하는 것보다는 훨씬 비용이 덜 드는구나.\n"
"\n"
"네가 이 설명서를 잃어버린다면, 그리고 잃어버리겠지만, 절망하지 마라. 네 일 년치 봉급을 써서 이 책의 사본을 인쇄한 다음 널리 퍼트릴 거니까. 시간이 지나면 탐리엘의 모든 연금술 제작대마다 이 책이 한 권씩 놓여있을 거란다.\n"

"\n"
"모든 포션에는 그 기본이 되어줄 용매가 필요하다는 것은 이미 알겠지. 내 가르침에 한 번이라도 집중을 했다면 최고의 용매는 자연에서 얻은 깨끗한 물이라는 것도 알 것이다. 물의 순도는 포션의 품질을 결정하니까, 자연 속의 샘물은 용매를 얻을 수 있는 최적의 장소란다.\n"
"\n"
"맑은 물의 중요성을 다시 한 번 강조해야 하겠구나. 그 치유 물약 사건을 기억하느냐? 물은 고인 물웅덩이, 바다의 만, 아니면 무두질 공장 아래쪽의 하류에서 그냥 대충 떠 오면 안 된다. 마을에서 깨끗한 물이 담긴 병을 찾을 수도 있겠지만, 제일 좋은 방법은 네 스스로 일하는 것이란다.\n"
"\n"
"그건 그렇고, 네 \"빗물받이 통 용매\"는 절대 효과가 없을 게다. 그 실험은 당장 그만두거라.\n"
"\n"
"두 번째 단계: 시약을 얻기\n"
"\n"
"연금술은 혼합의 학문이다. 용매는 포션의 기초를 이루고, 시약은 포션의 성분을 결정하지. 각각의 시약은 네 가지의 독특한 특성이 있단다. 너에게 '또다시' 이차 혼합에 대한 원리를 설명하고 싶지는 않구나. 기본을 기억해라. 비슷한 것들끼리 비교해 보는 거다.\n"
"\n"
"그 다음으로, 모든 시약들은 야생에서 찾을 수 있다. 내 실험실에서 찾지 말란 말이다! 식물과 버섯을 살피는 것을 잊지 말거라. 식물과 버섯만이다! 무슨 일이 있어도 이 말을 거슬러서는 안 된다. 그 \"다람쥐 가루\"는 여덟 신을 거스르는 흉물이었다.\n"
"\n"
"그 뿐만 아니라, 막자사발과 막자를 사용한 다음에는 깨끗하게 청소를 하라고 다시 한번 말해줘야 겠구나.\n"
"\n"
"세 번째 단계: 포션을 제조하기\n"
"\n"
"용매와 시약 두 개를 아무 연금술 제작대로 가져가거라. 다시 한번 말하건데, 서로 다른 시약이 필요하단다. 버그로스와 버그로스를 혼합하면 더러운 맛이 나는 맹물만 나올 뿐이야.\n"
"\n"
"필요한 것들을 모으면 그것들을 한 데 모아 너의 포션을 만들어라. 긍정적인 특성을 가진 시약들을 혼합하면 도움이 되는 포션을 만들 수 있지. 반면에 부정적인 특성을 가진 시약들을 혼합하면 그걸 마실 정도로 멍청한 사람들을 해칠 수 있단다. 시약들의 특성이 맞지 않는다면 용매와 시약을 모두 버리게 될 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"무엇을 만들어낼 수 있는지 알아보려면 다른 시약들로 실험을 하려무나. 시약의 특성을 알아보는 일은 너에게 맡기겠다. 하지만 시약을 먹어보면 가장 기초적인 특성을 배울 수 있다는 사실을 기억하거라. 딱 한 가지만 조심하고. 왕창 먹어 치우면 안 된다!\n"
"\n"
"생각난 김에 말인데, 네가 넌루트를 모조리 먹어치운걸 내가 모를 줄 알았니? 네 이빨이 노래를 불러대더구나. 그리고 빛나는 요강을 감출 수는 없는 법이란다.\n"
"\n"
"고급 연금술 원리\n"
"\n"
"네가 연금술의 기초를 숙달해야만 복잡한 과정을 생각해볼 수 있단다. 신중한 연구를 통해 포션을 제작할 때 부정적인 특성을 억제하는 법, 간단한 시약만으로 여러 개의 포션을 제작하는 법, 아니면 더 강력한 포션을 만들어내기 위해 추가적인 시약을 혼합하는 법을 배울 수 있지!\n"
"\n"
"하지만 지금은 \"혼자서 중독되지 말 것\"이 내가 너에게 바라는 목표란다."

"Supply Sergeant, Seventh Legion\n"
"\n"
"In my twenty years as supply captain for the Seventh Imperial, I learned one absolute truth: provisioning is the same whether feeding yourself or an entire army. Per Magus-General Septima Tharn's request, I will share what I know to aid the provisioners of less accomplished legions.\n"
"\n"
"Step 1: Acquire Ingredients \n"
"\n"
"When you are in the field, your backpack is the only pantry upon which your soldiers can rely. Requisition anything you can find—every barrel, chest, or sack of grain should make its contribution to your cause.\n"
"\n"
"As an Imperial soldier you have the right to requisition as much as you want, but use discretion. A citizen with an empty larder will have long memories of Imperial imposition. A single handful, scoop, or item from each barrel, chest, or sack is my simple rule.\n"
"\n"
"Step 2: Acquire Recipes\n"
"\n"
"Never forget that you are a provisioner, not a chef. You aren't cooking personal meals for the Duchess of Cheydinhal. It doesn't matter how the food tastes as long as it feeds your cohort. You want recipes that are fast, simple, and best made in bulk.\n"
"\n"
"Take roasted chicken breast, a meal that requires poultry. It doesn't matter that you know the ingredients required—without a proper recipe, they're just raw meat. Locals always have their own ways to prepare local ingredients, so stay vigilant for recipes while requisitioning supplies.\n"
"\n"
"Step 3: Cook, Cook, Cook \n"
"\n"
"Once you've learned a recipe, bring those ingredients to a cooking fire. Then cook them. Don't burn the food.\n"
"\n"
"Remember to serve your cohort what it needs most. Scouts and skirmishers need plenty of vegetables. Mages in your cohort are best fed fruits. Infantry can always use hearty meat dishes. Never forget that a hot meal can make the difference between life and death.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: Brewing On The Go\n"
"\n"
"I hear enough questions about brewing to warrant its own section. I recommend you never keep more than a flask of fine brew with you. Your cohort will know it's a prize for those who truly distinguish themselves.\n"
"\n"
"Yet sometimes the cohort needs liquid courage, such as before a battle or a parade review. This is when I brew horrible swill from local recipes, both to shock the soldiers into a state of confident readiness and to keep them from growing fond of the stuff.\n"
"\n"
"Step 1 and Step 2 are identical to the similar steps for cooking. As for the third?\n"
"\n"
"Step 3: Brew, Brew, Brew\n"
"\n"
"Once you've learned a recipe, bring those ingredients to a cooking fire. Then brew them. Don't spoil the drink.\n"
"\n"
"I often present excess brew to the locals who \"donated\" the ingredients in the first place. This is not Imperial requisition policy, but it helps my cohort stay in their future good graces should we suffer a retreat due to the actions of less stalwart legions."

"\n"
"첫 번째 단계: 재료를 얻기\n"
"\n"
"전장에 나가면 당신의 가방은 당신의 병사들이 의지할 수 있는 유일한 식료품 저장실이 된다. 찾을 수 있는 것은 뭐든지 징발하라. 모든 통, 상자, 혹은 곡식 자루가 당신의 목적에 이바지할 것이다.\n"

"\n"
"두 번째 단계: 조리법을 얻기\n"
"\n"
"당신은 요리사이지 주방장이 아니라는 사실을 잊지 마라. 체이딘할의 공작부인을 위한 개인적인 식사를 대접하는 것이 아니라는 말이다. 군대를 먹이는 한 음식의 맛이 어떤지는 중요치 않다. 당신에겐 빠르고, 간단하며, 대량으로 요리하기 쉬운 조리법이 필요하다.\n"
"\n"
"구운 닭가슴살은 가금류가 필요한 요리이다. 당신이 필요한 재료를 알고 있는지는 중요치 않다. 조리법이 없으면, 그것들은 단순한 생고기에 불과하다. 현지인들은 항상 그 지역의 재료를 준비하는 방법을 알고 있으므로, 물자를 징발하는 중에 조리법이 있는지 항상 주의 깊게 살펴라.\n"
"\n"
"세 번째 단계: 요리하고, 요리하고, 요리하기\n"
"\n"
"조리법을 배웠다면 재료를 요리용 화덕으로 가져가라. 그 다음 그것으로 요리를 해라. 음식을 태우지는 마라.\n"
"\n"
"군대를 먹이는 것이 당신에게 가장 중요하다는 것을 기억하라. 정찰병과 척후병들은 많은 채소류가 필요하다. 군대의 마법사들에게는 과일을 먹이는 것이 제일이다. 보병대는 언제나 따뜻한 고기 요리를 소비한다. 따뜻한 식사가 생존과 죽음의 차이를 만들 수 있다는 사실을 절대로 잊어선 안 된다.\n"
"\n"
"부록: 끊임없는 양조\n"
"\n"
"양조에 대한 질문을 수도 없이 들었기 때문에 따로 다루도록 하겠다. 나는 자기가 마실 좋은 것 한 병보다 더 많은 술은 절대로 꿍쳐두지 말 것을 추천하는 바이다. 당신의 부대원들은 누구에게 잘 보여야 하는지를 본능적으로 알아챌 것이다. \n"
"\n"
"그렇긴 하지만 가끔은 군대에도 용기를 위한 액체가 필요한 법이다. 전투 전이나 가두 행진같은 상황 말이다. 이건 내가 현지 조리법으로 끔찍한 구정물을 양조했을 때의 일인데, 병사들에게 충격을 줘서 전투 능력을 향상시키는 동시에 취하는 물건에 대한 선호를 억눌렀던 적도 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"첫 번째와 두 번째 단계는 요리하는 것과 거의 똑같다. 세 번째는 어떨까?\n"
"\n"
"세 번째 단계: 양조하고, 양조하고, 양조하기\n"
"\n"
"조리법을 배웠다면 재료를 요리용 화덕으로 가져가라. 그 다음 그것으로 양조를 해라. 술을 망치지는 마라.\n"
"\n"
"그리고 나는 재료를 \"기부\"해 주었던 지역민들에게 그 이상의 양조주를 선물하곤 한다. 이건 제국의 징발 정책은 아니지만, 내가 속한 군대가 덜 충직했던 군단들의 행동 때문에 후퇴하는 고통을 겪지 않고 품위있게 머물 수 있도록 도와주곤 한다."

"\n"
"Today you learn how to work with wood. Now, stop your belly-groanin' and listen! Woodworkin' is an honest trade, and you're going to do right by old Hoary. I'll use tiny words so even Tebbons can follow.\n"
"\n"
"First off, take this axe to the woods. Look for mossy logs near old stumps and rocks, and then chop me ten pieces of rough maple. What? Why is it called— Because it's rough, ye daft child! You'll need that much if you're to make something of anything.\n"
"\n"
"Second, bring those ten rough maple pieces to a woodworkin' station. You're gonna turn those rough maple pieces into sanded maple. We in the trade call it \"refinement.\" No, not sanding, refinement! Yes, you get sanded wood. No, that's not confusing at all!\n"
"\n"
"Third— Would ye listen up? This is important! Ye can't just start carvin' away at sanded maple without a style in mind. Hmm? A style! Every race in Tamriel has their own style, and a material they prefer to work.\n"
"\n"
"Them <<m:1>> craft materials in the <<1>> style, d'ye see? Now, ye buy the style material in town. From a woodworker, ye addlepated— No, it doesn't matter which one!\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, your last task is takin' your style material and three sanded maple pieces to a woodworkin' station. Craft yerself a maple bow. Don't worry about the bowstring. I said, pay it no mind! Curvin' that bow like the leg of a bendy Wood Elf dancer is what you should try to— Hmm? None of your concern!\n"
"\n"
"What do you mean, \"Is that all?\" By the Eight Divines, of course that ain't all there is to woodworkin'! Ye can make better quality carpentry if more wood goes into an item's makin'. Even then, ye can improve it further.\n"
"\n"
"I was gettin' to it! That maple bow isn't the best you can make it until you improve it with resins. You'll find 'em around. You know, \"around!\" But try to improve that bow without enough resin and you'll ruin the bow and waste the resin.\n"
"\n"
"Yes, there'll always be maple in the woods. What do you mean? When are you going to be in a desert? Oh, for … All right. You're in a desert, and ye can't find maple because you can't find the woods. But say ye have your maple bow. Bring it to a woodworkin' station and deconstruct some of what ye need from the bow itself. 'Course, ye lose the bow. We call this part \"deconstruction\"—like your sister's bad poetry, if ye could take a chisel to it.\n"
"\n"
"How'd I get so good at woodworkin'? Research. No, not like reading. If I got my hands on a decent piece of carpentry, I'd take it apart and study the traits that made it special. Took me time, and I'd lose the carpentry when I pulled it apart, but once I'd worked out how the original woodworker done it, I could make it myself.\n"

"Future challengers! The Shattered Masque has fought far too many opponents who fail to realize the importance of proper footwear.\n"
"\n"
"This basic primer will to teach you how to make a simple pair of homespun shoes. If we're to face each other in the Blessed Crucible, I want you to fall because of my unmatched skill—not your pathetic boot stitching.\n"
"\n"
"Step 1: Acquire Jute\n"
"\n"
"Raw jute is cheap, plentiful, and easy to weave.  Look for the distinctive yellow flowers in the wild. I suppose you could pay someone to pick them for you, and it's that kind of laziness I look forward to punishing in the arena.\n"
"\n"
"Step 2: Refine Cloth\n"
"\n"
"You can work with raw jute at any clothing station. Professional clothiers call this process \"refinement,\" which can be done with any raw material. For now, you'll need ten raw jute plants to make the refined jute you'll need for shoes.\n"
"\n"
"Unless working a loom is beneath you. Weakling.\n"
"\n"
"Step 3: Style!\n"
"\n"
"Clothiers from all across Tamriel have their own cultural style. You need style to make an impression in the dueling ring, so find the style material that's easiest for you to work. If you're <<a:1>>, start with material for the <<1>> style. Purchase it from clothiers or take them from your whimpering, defeated enemies.\n"
"\n"
"Step 4: Craft Your Shoes\n"
"\n"
"Bring your style material and five bolts of jute to a clothing station. (Remember—refined jute, not raw jute plants.) Now, get to work and craft yourself a pair of homespun shoes. You can use more bolts for better quality shoes, but you should start with five bolts.\n"
"\n"
"Easy work! As easy as it will be for me to crush your pathetic and deluded hopes of winning the Brimstone Crown.\n"
"\n"
"Making Clothes the Shattered Masque Way\n"
"\n"
"Any arena fighter worth their salt doesn't stop with a simple pair of shoes. Try making a pair of rawhide boots for added protection, or a colorful sash to make you stand out in the ring. If you get the hang of this clothier business, you'll even have a trade to fall back upon after I thoroughly humiliate you in front of everyone you've ever loved.\n"
"\n"
"Improving Your Shoes\n"
"\n"
"The art of improving the shoes you make—or any other bit of clothing, really—requires you to work with tannins at a clothing station. If you aren't careful, you'll ruin the clothing and the tannins in the process. Use as many tannins as you think you'll need.\n"
"\n"
"Find them on your own. I won't make everything easy for you.\n"
"\n"
"Deconstruction\n"
"\n"
"Maybe you're the kind of person who cuts corners. If you don't have time to collect raw materials, you can always deconstruct clothing you no longer need. This will destroy the clothing, but maybe you'll salvage enough to make a hat I can knock off your head.\n"
"\n"
"Researching Traits\n"
"\n"
"By now you're thinking. \"I'll need an edge if I'm going dare to fight the Shattered Masque.\" You could always research unique traits of items made by better clothiers than you by taking their clothing apart and studying their techniques. Anything to boost your confidence long enough for me to stomp it into dust."

"Orc forge-wives say they're the only ones who know how to smith. I say mudcrabs to that! I'll show you how to find ore, extract ingots from the ore, explain crafting styles, and then teach you how to craft a weapon. Soon enough, you'll call yourself a blacksmith.\n"
"\n"
"Step 1: Get Some Iron Ore\n"
"\n"
"Iron ore is the simplest to work, and easy to replace if you make a mistake. Look for rusty, dull rock near big rock outcroppings. Then you mine it. If you don't mine it yourself, buy it from people who mine it, or ask a friend to loan you some. When you have ten chunks of iron ore, you're ready for the next step.\n"
"\n"
"Step 2: Refine Ingots\n"
"\n"
"Find a blacksmithing station. Then make iron ingots from your ten chunks of iron ore. This is called \"refinement.\" If you want to know why, ask a forge-wife.\n"
"\n"
"Step 3: Choose A Style\n"
"\n"
"Every race has a style of blacksmithing, and each favors a traditional material. I call this a \"style material\" because it's easy to remember. The Orc style works best for me, but I'm an Orc. If you're <<a:1>>, start with material for the <<1>> style. Blacksmiths sell them, if you can't find them anywhere else.\n"
"\n"
"Step 4: Make An Iron Dagger\n"
"\n"
"Iron daggers are easy to make. You need one style material, two iron ingots, and a steady hand with a hammer. When you have these things, find a blacksmithing station and craft an iron dagger. For better quality blades, use more ingots to make it. But for now, use two iron ingots.\n"
"\n"
"Step 5: Admire Your Iron Dagger\n"
"\n"
"Take a moment to admire your work. It's not \"just an iron dagger.\" You pulled metal from the ground and forged into a tool that can end lives. Respect what you've made.\n"
"\n"
"Forge-wives won't be impressed with your iron dagger, but what do they know? You're a blacksmith if you do the work, not if you marry into it. Remember: iron daggers today, ebony greatswords tomorrow.\n"
"\n"
"Appendix: Advanced Smithing\n"
"\n"
"If you really want to show up the forge-wives, you need to know more than just iron daggers.\n"
"\n"
"Improving Weapons and Armor\n"
"\n"
"Use a \"temper\" to improve weapons and armor you've smithed. I call them that because I can never find one when I need it. This always makes me lose my temper.\n"
"\n"
"When you find one, bring it to a blacksmithing station with the item you want to improve. The more tempers you have, the greater the chance to improve the quality. But this is not a guarantee. If you do it wrong, you'll lose the tempers and the item.\n"
"\n"
"Deconstruction\n"
"\n"
"If you're short on materials, you can deconstruct them from weapons or armor. You'll destroy the item when you break it down, and you'll only salvage part of what went into making it, but it's a quick way to get ingots.\n"
"\n"
"Researching Traits\n"
"\n"
"One way to annoy a forge-wife is to buy her finest items, take them apart, and research the best traits of her weapons and armor. Then you can make copies of her best work and sell them for less. Do it all on her own blacksmithing station if you really want to make her angry."

"\n"
"네 번째 단계: 철 단검을 만들기\n"
"\n"
"철 단검은 만들기 쉽다. 필요한 것이라곤 스타일 재료 한 개, 철 주괴 두 개, 그리고 안정된 손에 쥐여진 망치 뿐이다. 이것들을 갖추었다면 대장기술 제작대를 찾아 철 단검을 제작하라. 검날의 품질을 높이려면 제작할 때 더 많은 주괴를 사용하면 된다. 하지만 일단 지금은 두 개를 사용하라.\n"
"\n"

"화로-아내들은 당신의 철 단검에 감탄하지는 않겠지만, 그녀들이 뭘 알겠는가? 당신이 작업을 계속 해 나간다면 대장장이가 될 것이고, 아니라면 결혼을 하게 될 것이다. 명심하라. 오늘의 철 단검은, 내일의 에보니 대검이 된다는 것을.\n"
"\n"
"부록: 고급 대장기술\n"

"\n"
"첨가물을 하나 찾으면 개량하려는 물건과 함께 대장기술 제작대로 가져가라. 더 많은 첨가물이 있으면 품질을 개량할 수 있는 확률이 더 높아진다. 하지만 항상 가능한 것은 아니다. 일을 잘못하면 첨가물과 물건을 잃게 될 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"분해\n"
"\n"
"만약 재료가 부족하다면 무기와 방어구를 분해해서 재료를 얻을 수 있다. 분해할 때 물건은 파괴되고, 물건에 쓰인 재료의 일부만을 살려낼 수 있지만, 주괴를 빠르게 얻을 수 있는 방법이다.\n"
"\n"
"특성을 연구하기\n"
"\n"
"화로-아내를 약 오르게 하는 방법 중 하나는 그녀들에게서 가장 좋은 무기와 방어구를 산 다음 그걸 해체해서 그 물건의 최고의 특성을 연구하는것이다. 그렇게 하면 그 화로-아내가 만든 최고의 작품을 복제해서 더 싼 값에 팔 수 있다. 화로-아내를 진짜로 화나게 만들고 싶으면 그 화로-아내가 소유한 대장기술 제작대에서 상기한 내용을 실행하면 된다."

"This is Lecture Eight: On the Nature of Coldharbour. It looks to me like there are more of you here than there should be, so please check your ledger—if it says Transliminal Bridges, you're in the wrong room.\n"
"\n"
"Coldharbour is the Oblivion realm ruled by Molag Bal, the Daedric Prince of brutality, slavery, vampirism, and other assorted abominations. It is not, therefore, a pleasant place. Descriptions of the plane vary widely, as usual in any study of Oblivion, but all accounts agree that Coldharbour is a dismal, cold, and largely lifeless realm pervaded by a miasma of fear, where lost souls are tormented for eternity.\n"
"\n"
"This emphasizes the point made in my previous lectures, that a plane of Oblivion, being made of the very stuff of chaos, takes on form and character that reflects the nature of its ruler. Coldharbour, therefore, has been molded to embody the purposes of mighty Molag Bal.\n"
"\n"
"And what are those purposes? As it happens, I can speak to this subject with some authority, for I recently acquired the library and papers of the late Cardinal Belforte of the Order of Stendarr. The Cardinal devoted his life to ridding Tamriel of Daedric cultists of all persuasions. He was particularly rigorous in his persecution of the worshipers of Molag Bal, and in his time acquired a number of their repulsive tracts and treatises.\n"
"\n"
"Study of these sources reveals that Molag Bal desires, above all things, the enslavement of mortals' souls. Various loathsome means are employed to this end, the ultimate goal being the diversion of a soul from its journey to the afterlife to imprisonment and slavery on the plane of Coldharbour. Upon arrival in Molag Bal's realm, the soul attracts to itself some of the loose creatia of Oblivion, forming a corporeal body with the semblance of the shape it wore in life. These sad slaves, called the soul-shriven, then toil in torment for the glory and amusement of their master, Molag the Slave-Lord.\n"

They're here solely for the amusement of the Dread Lord—and he takes a lot of amusing. So pay attention. You're going to be assigned a coffle of soul-shriven, you're going to be told what they need to do, and then you're going to make sure they do it. \n"

"And you're going to be brutal about it. That's the good part, but also the tricky part—because we only get so many soul-shriven, and we have to make them last.

"I did note, however, that when Divayth Fyr sought a Daedra of a character like unto the Dremora, but of greater power, and greater inclination for independence and initiative, or solely as a master, he summoned Xivilai, who are like the Dremora in personality and temperament, except that they hate subordination, and are liable to disloyalty and betrayal when they feel they have not been treated with the proper deference and respect.\n"

There are no limits to the varieties of behaviors that may be observed, and in one place they may be this, and in another place they may that, and all rules describing them are always found to be contradictory and in exception to others.\n"
"\n"
"Further, from whom may we seek answers to our questions about these orders? From mortals, who know little but what they may observe of another world? From the gods, who speak in riddles, of enigmas wrapped in mysteries, and who keep things from us, the better to preserve their dominion over us? From the Daedra themselves, who are never the models of straightforwardness or truthtelling, but rather are famous for misstatements and obfuscations?\n"
"\n"
"And even were the Daedra to speak the truth, how can we know if they know themselves, or that there is any truth about them that is to be known, or are all arrangements among the Daedra protean and ever subject to change?\n"
"\n"
"In short, what is to be known is little and what is to be trusted is nothing.\n"
"\n"
"These things being said, I shall venture to relate what I have observed and heard of the relationships of the servants of Lord Dagon in my brief service to the Telvanni Wizard Divayth Fyr, when I sought him out and offered to bring peace to the victims of corprus in his sanitarium.\n"
"\n"
"Divayth Fyr told me that he, by choice, trafficked only with two Daedra Powers—Mehrunes Dagon and Azura.\n"
"\n"
"Azura, he said, knew and understood all things, and declined to speak of these things, or only spoke in riddles.\n"
"\n"
"Mehrunes Dagon, on the other hand, out of pride, fixity of purpose, and a predictable lack of subtlety in thought, knew nothing and understood nothing, and was inclined to speak freely and without falsehood.\n"
"\n"
"Divayth Fyr said that Dagon's chief servants, the Dremora, were like him in pride, fixed purpose, and lack of subtlety, with the addition of the peculiar traits of honor and loyalty, both within their class and within their relationship to Lord Dagon.\n"
"\n"
"And Divayth Fyr said that the Dremora were ordered into clans and castes, and these clans and castes were well-defined. Individual Dremora might rise or fall in ranks, or move back and forth among clans, but only when regulated by complex oaths, and only at the will and pleasure of their Lord Dagon.\n"
"\n"
"The Dremora refer to themselves as \"The Kyn\" (\"the People\"), contrasting themselves to other Daedra, whom they consider unthinking animals. The term \"kynaz\" refers to a member of the Dremora race (\"he of the Kyn\").\n"
"\n"
"The least of kyn castes are the Churls, the undistinguished rabble of the lowest rank of Dremora. Churls are obsequious to superiors but ferociously cruel to humans and other Daedra.\n"
"\n"
"Next in rank are the Caitiffs, creatures of uncalculating zeal, energy without discrimination. Caitiffs are used as irregulars in the faction wars of the Daedra, as berserkers and shock troops, undisciplined and unreliable, but eager and willing.\n"
"\n"
"The highest of the regular rank-and-file of Dremora troops are the Kynvals, warrior-knights who have distinguished themselves in battle, and shown the deliberate steadiness of potential war leaders.\n"
"\n"
"Above the rank and file warriors of the Churl, Caitiff, and Kynval castes are the officer castes.\n"
"\n"
"A Kynreeve is a clan sheriff or clan officer. Kynreeves are typically associated either with a clan fighting unit or an administrative office in the order of battle.\n"
"\n"
"The Kynmarcher is the lord and high officer of a Daedric citadel, outpost, or gate. A Kymarcher's command is usually associated both with a unit and with a \"fief\"— a location or territory for which he is responsible.\n"
"\n"
"Above the Kymarcher is the Markynaz, or \"grand duke.\" A Markynaz is a lord of lords, and member of the Markyn, Mehrunes Dagon's Council of Lords.\n"
"\n"
"The highest rank of Dremora is the Valkynaz, or \"prince.\" This warrior duke is a member of the Valkyn, Mehrunes Dagon's personal guard. The Valkynaz are rarely encountered on Tamriel; normally they remain by Mehrunes Dagon's side, or serve as commanders of operations of particular importance or interest to Dagon."

"앞서 말한 것으로 인해, 나는 내가 군주 데이건의 수하들의 관계에 대해 테바니의 마법사인 디베이스 피르 (Divayth Fyr)를 섬기던 시절에 관찰하고 들은 것을 감히 말하고자 한다. 당시는 내가 그를 찾아내어 그의 요양소에 있는 코프루스 (corprus) 질병의 희생자들에게 평안을 가져다주었을 때였는데, 화신의 예언이 성취되었고, 다고스-우르가 소멸되었으며, 역병이 바덴펠에서 영원히 사라진 때였다.\n"
"\n"

"그, 디베이스 피르가 말하길, 아주라는 세상의 모든 것을 알고 또 이해하고 있으며, 그것들에 대해서 말하기를 꺼리거나, 수수께끼를 이용해서만 말한다고 한다.\n"

"반대로, 자만심의 상징이자, 단 하나의 목적을 가지며, 생각에 대한 치밀함이 너무 뻔할 정도로 모자란 메이룬스 데이건은 아무것도 알지도, 이해하지도 못하지만, 자유롭게 말하고 거짓말을 하지 않는 경향이 있다고 한다.\n"
"\n"
"디베이스 피르가 말하길 데이건의 시종장급인 드레모라들은 자만심과 확고한 목적, 그리고 치밀함의 부족함에 있어서 주인과 닮았으며, 그들 서로와, 또 그들의 주인인 군주 데이건과의 양 관계에 있어서는 명예와 충성심도 가지고 있다고 한다.\n"
"\n"
"그리고 디베이스 피르의 말에 따르면 이 드레모라는 집단과 계급에 속하는 것을 명받고, 이 집단과 계급은 매우 잘 정해져 있다고 한다. 한 드레모라는 계급이 오르거나 하락하고, 또는 다른 집단에 들어가기도 하지만, 이것은 복잡한 서약에 의해 규제당한 경우에만, 그리고 그들의 주인인 군주 데이건의 의지나 여흥이 있을 때만 그렇게 된다고 한다.\n"
"\n"
"이러한 드레모라는 그들 스스로를 'The Kyn'이라고 부르는데, 이것은 다른 데이드라들을 생각없는 짐승으로 여기며 이들과 자신들을 구분하기 위한 용어이다. 'kynaz'라는 용어는 이러한 드레모라 종족('Kyn에 속해있는 자')의 구성원을 칭하는 말이다.\n"
"\n"
"가장 약한 킨 계급은 처얼 인데, 드레모라의 최하위 계급으로 뛰어난 점이 없는 폭도무리이다. 처얼은 상급자에게 아첨하는 성격이지만 인류와 다른 데이드라에게는 사나울 정도로 잔인하다.\n"
"\n"
"다음 계급은 케이티프 로, 분별력이 없고 열정적이며 식별력이 없으나 힘이 넘쳐나는 생명체이다. 케이티프들은 데이드라의 파벌전쟁에서 광전사인 비정규병으로, 또는 광전사들의 기습부대로서 사용되는데, 규율도 없고 믿을 수도 없지만, 탐욕스럽고 열정적이다.\n"
"\n"
"드레모라 군대의 정규 일반 사병 계급의 최상위인 계급은 킨발 (Kynval)이며, 전투시에는 그들 스스로를 전사-기사로서 구분하고, 계획적이고 숙련된 잠재적인 전쟁 지휘관들이다.\n"

"It is improper, however customary, to refer to the denizens of the dimension of Oblivion as \"demons.\" This practice probably dates to the Alessian Doctrines of the First Era prophet Maruhk—which, rather amusingly, forbade \"trafficke with daimons\" and then neglected to explain what daimons were.\n"
"\n"
"It is most probable that \"daimon\" is a misspelling or etymological rendition of \"Daedra,\" the old Elven word for those strange, powerful creatures of uncertain motivation who hail from the dimensions of Oblivion. In a later tract by King Hale the Pious of Skyrim, almost a thousand years after the publication of the original Doctrines, the evil machinations of his political enemies are compared to \"the wickedness of the demons of Oblivion … their depravity equals that of Sanguine itself, they are cruel as Boethiah, calculating as Molag Bal, and mad as Sheogorath.\" Hale the Pious thus long-windedly introduced four of the Daedra Lords to written record.\n"
"\n"
"But the written record is not, after all, the best way to research Oblivion and the Daedra who inhabit it. Those who \"trafficke with daimons\" seldom wish it to be a matter of public account. Nevertheless, scattered throughout the literature of the First Era are diaries, journals, notices for witch burnings, and guides for Daedra-slayers. These I have used as my primary source material. They are at least as trustworthy as the Daedra lords I have actually summoned and spoken with at length.\n"
"\n"
"Apparently, Oblivion is a place composed of many lands—thus the many names for which Oblivion is synonymous: Coldharbour, Quagmire, Moonshadow, etc. It may be correctly supposed that each land of Oblivion is ruled over by one prince. The Daedric Princes whose names appear over and over in ancient records (though this is not an infallible test of their authenticity or explicit existence, to be sure) are the aforementioned Sanguine, Boethiah, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath, and in addition Azura, Mephala, Clavicus Vile, Vaermina, Malacath, Hoermius (or Hermaeus or Hormaius or Herma—there seems to be no one accepted spelling) Mora, Namira, Jyggalag, Nocturnal, Mehrunes Dagon, and Peryite.\n"
"\n"
"From my experience, Daedra are a very mixed lot. It is almost impossible to categorize them as a whole except for their immense power and penchant for extremism. Be that as it may, I have here attempted to do so in a few cases, purely for the sake of scholastic expediency.\n"
"\n"
"Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, Peryite, Boethiah, and Vaermina are among the most consistently \"demonic\" of the Daedra, in the sense that their spheres seem to be destructive in nature. The other Daedra can, of course, be equally dangerous, but seldom purely for the sake of destruction as these five can. Nor are these previous five identical in their destructiveness. Mehrunes Dagon seems to prefer natural disasters—earthquakes and volcanoes—for venting his anger. Molag Bal elects the employment of other Daedra, and Boethiah inspires the arms of mortal warriors. Peryite's sphere seems to be pestilence, and Vaermina's torture.\n"
"\n"
"In preparation for the next installment in this series, I will be investigating two matters that have intrigued me since I began my career as a Daedra researcher. The first is on one particular Daedra, perhaps yet another Daedric Prince, referred to in multiple articles of incunabula as Hircine. Hircine has been called \"the Huntsman of the Princes\" and \"the Father of Man-beasts,\" but I have yet to find anyone who can summon him. The other, and perhaps more doubtful, goal I have is to find a practical means for mortal men to pass through to Oblivion. It has always been my philosophy that we need only fear that which we do not understand—and with that thought in mind, I ever pursue my objective."

"오블리비언 차원에 거주하는 자들을 \"데몬\"으로 부르는 것은 부적절하지만, 통상적으로 그렇게 사용된다. 이러한 관습은 아마 제 1시대에 예언자 마루크의 '알레시안 규율'에서 시작된 듯 하다. -- 다소 재미있는 점은, 거기에서 \"다이몬 (daimon)들과의 부적절한 거래\" 를 금지하고 있고 그런다음에 다이몬들이 무엇인지에 대한 설명은 등한시하고 있다는 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"가장 유력한 것은 \"다이몬\"이 오기이거나, 오블리비언의 차원으로부터 온 낯설고 강력한 모호한 의도의 생명체들에 대한 고대 엘븐 문자인 \"데이드라\"의 어원학상 번역이라는 것이다. (사실, \"데이드라\"는 복수형이다; 단수형은 \"데이드로스 = daedroth\"이다.) 규율의 원본이 출판된지 거의 수천년이 지난, 스카이림의 경건한 헤일 (Hale) 왕이 쓴 소책자에서, 그의 정적들의 사악한 음모를 다음과 같이 비유하고 있다.\"오블리비언 데몬의 사악함...마치 생귄같은 그들의 타락, 그들은 보에시아처럼 잔인하고, 몰락 발처럼 계산적이고, 쉐오고라스처럼 미쳤다.\" 헤일은 이렇게 길게 4명의 데이드라 군주들을 소개하고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"그러나 결국엔 기록보다는 오블리비언과 그곳에 거주하는 데이드라에 대해 연구하는 것이 최선의 방법이다. \"다이몬들과 부적적한 거래\"를 한 사람들은 좀처럼 그것이 공공연한 문제가 되길 원하지 않는다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 제 1시대의 문학 작품들인 일기, 여행기, 중대한 것에 대한 비평, 데이드라 사냥꾼을 위한 가이드등을 통해서 사방으로 퍼져나갔다. 이것들은 나의 중요한 사료로서 이용되고 있다. 내가 직접소환했고 충분히 이야기를 나눈 데이드라 군주들처럼 그것들은 적어도 믿을 수 있다.\n"
"\n"
"오블리비언은 많은 땅으로 구성되어 있다 -- 오블리비언은 동의어로서 이처럼 많은 이름들이 있다 : 콜드하버, 콰그마이어, 문셰도우 등등. 아마 오블리비언 각각의 땅은 한명의 프린스가 지배하고 있다고 생각하는 것이 옳을 것이다. 고대기록에 (그들의 신뢰성이나 명백한 존재에 대해서는 확실한 시험이 있지는 않았지만, 아마도 확실할 것이다) 수없이 나타나는 데이드라 프린스들은 다음과 같다.- 생귄, 보에시아, 몰락 발, 쉐오고라스, 아주라, 메팔라, 클라비쿠스 바일, 베르니마, 말라카스, 허미우스 (또는 허메우스 또는 호마이우스 또는 헤르마 -- 통일된 철자는 없는 듯하다) 모라, 나미라, 지갈랙, 녹터널, 메이룬스 데이건, 페리아이트.\n"
"\n"
"내 경험으로 보건데, 데이드라는 매우 복합적인 존재이다. 극단적으로 그들의 거대한 힘과 경향을 제외한 전체로서 그들을 범주화하는 것은 거의 불가능하다. 가능하다면, 나는 여기에서 몇가지 사례들에서 그것을 시도해보려고 한다, 순수하게 학문적 편의를 위해서이다.\n"
"\n"
"메이룬스 데이건, 몰락 발, 페리아이트, 보에시아, 그리고 베르니마는 그들의 신분이 파괴적 성향인듯 보인다는 뜻에서, 시종일관 데이드라의 \"악마적인 면\"으로 간주되어진다. 물론 다른 데이드라도 그처럼 위험할 수는 있지만, 좀처럼 이 다섯 데이드라처럼 파괴적으로 보이진 않는다. 이들 전자의 다섯 데이드라는 그들의 파괴적 성향에서 모두 동일하지는 않다. 메이룬스 데이건은 그의 분노를 폭발시키기 위해 자연재앙을-- 지진과 화산폭발 -- 선호하는 것 같다. 몰락 발은 다른 데이드라 소환수를 선택하고, 보에시아는 무기에 죽음의 전사들을 불어넣는다. 페리아이트의 신분은 역병인 듯 하고, 베르니마는 고문이다.\n"
"\n"
"이 시리즈의 다음 권에서는, 내가 데이드라 연구자로써 경력을 시작한 이래 나를 궁금하게 했던 두가지 문제를 조사할 것이다. 하나는 허씬에 관한 초기 간행본 여러 단락에서 언급되는, 아마도 다른 데이드라 프린스가 아닌것 같은 한 특별한 데드로쓰에 대한 것이다. 허씬은 \"프린스들의 사냥꾼\" 이자 \"인간-야수의 아버지\" 라고 칭해지고 있다. 그러나 나는 아직 그를 소환할 수 있는 어떠한 방법도 알지 못한다. 다른 하나는, 아마 더 의심스러운 것인데, 필멸자들이 오블리비언으로 지나가는 특별한 방법을 찾는 것이다. 우리가 이해할 수 없는 것들에 대해서만 두려워해야 한다는 것이 나의 일관된 철학이다. -- 그러한 생각으로 내 목표를 추구하고 있다."

"Divayth Fyr was not easy to reach, and he was reluctant to share with Morian Zenas the secret Door to Oblivion. Fortunately, my master's knowledge of lore impressed Fyr, and he taught him the way. I would be breaking my promise to Zenas and Fyr to explain the procedure here, and I would not divulge it even if I could. If there is dangerous knowledge to be had, that is it, but I do not reveal too much by saying Fyr's scheme relied on exploiting a series of portals to various realms created by a Telvanni wizard long missing and presumed dead. Against the disadvantage of this limited number of access points, we weighed the relative reliability and security of passage, and we considered ourselves fortunate in our informant.\n"

"Morian Zenas then left this world to begin his exploration. I stayed at the library to transcribe his information and help him with any research he needed.\n"
"\n"
"\"Dust,\" he whispered to me on the first day of his voyage. Despite the inherent dreariness of the word, I could hear his excitement in his voice, echoing in my mind. \"I can see from one end of the world to the other in a million shades of gray. There is no sky or ground or air, only particles, floating, falling, whirling about me. I must levitate and breathe by magical means ….\"\n"
"\n"
"Zenas explored the nebulous land for some time, encountering vaporous creatures and palaces of smoke. Though he never met the Daedric Prince, we concluded that he was in Ashpit, said to be the home of Malacath, where anguish, betrayal, and broken promises filled the bitter air like ash.\n"
"\n"
"\"The sky is on fire,\" I heard him say as he moved on to the next realm. \"The ground is sludge, but traversable. I see blackened ruins all around me, like a war was fought here in the distant past. The air is freezing. I cast blooms of warmth all around me, but it still feels like daggers of ice stabbing me in all directions.\"\n"
"\n"
"This was Coldharbour, where Molag Bal was the realm's Daedric Prince. It appeared to Zenas as if it were a future Nirn governed under the Lord of Brutality: desolate and barren, filled with suffering. I could hear Morian Zenas weep at the images he saw and shiver at the sight of the Imperial Palace, spattered with blood and excrement.\n"
"\n"
"\"Too much beauty,\" Zenas gasped when he went to the next realm. \"I am half blind. I see flowers and waterfalls, majestic trees, a city of silver, but it is all a blur. The colors run like water. It's raining now, and the wind smells like perfume. This surely is Moonshadow, where Azura dwells.\"\n"
"\n"
"Zenas was right, and astonishingly, he even had audience with the Queen of Dusk and Dawn in her rose palace. She listened to his tale with a smile and foretold to him the coming of the Nerevarine. My master found Moonshadow so lovely, he wished to stay there, half-blind, forever, but he knew he must move on and complete his journey of discovery.\n"
"\n"
"\"I am in a storm,\" he told me as he entered the next realm. He described the landscape of dark twisted trees, howling spirits, and billowing mist, and I thought he might have entered the Deadlands of Mehrunes Dagon. But then he said quickly, \"No, I am no longer in a forest. There was a flash of lightning, and now I am on a ship. The mast is tattered. The crew is slaughtered. Something is coming through the waves … oh, gods! Wait, now, I am in a dank dungeon, in a cell ….\"\n"
"\n"
"He was not in the Deadlands, but Quagmire, the nightmare realm of Vaermina. Every few minutes, there was a flash of lightning and reality shifted, always to something more horrible and horrifying. A dark castle one moment, a den of ravening beasts the next, a moonlit swamp, a coffin where he was buried alive. Fear got the better of my master, and he quickly passed to the next realm.\n"
"\n"
"I heard him laugh, \"I feel like I'm home now.\"\n"
"\n"
"Morian Zenas described to me an endless library, shelves stretching on in every direction, stacks on top of stacks. Pages floated on a mystical wind that he could not feel. Every book had a black cover with no title. He could see no one, but felt the presence of ghosts moving through the stacks, rifling through books, ever searching.\n"
"\n"
"It was Apocrypha, the home of Hermaeus Mora, where all forbidden knowledge can be found. I felt a shudder in my mind, but I could not tell if it was my master's or mine.\n"
"\n"
"Morian Zenas never traveled to another realm that I know of.\n"
"\n"
"Throughout his visits to the first four realms, my master spoke to me constantly. Upon entering the Apocrypha, he became quieter, as he was lured into the world of research and study, the passions that had controlled his heart while on Nirn. I would frantically try to call to him, but he closed his mind to me.\n"
"\n"
"Then he would whisper, \"This cannot be ….\"\n"
"\n"
"\"No one would ever guess the truth ….\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I must learn more ….\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I see the world, a last illusion's shimmer, it is crumbling all around us ….\"\n"
"\n"
"I would cry back to him, begging him to tell me what was happening, what he was seeing, what he was learning. I even tried using Conjuration to summon him as if he were a Daedra himself, but he refused to leave. Morian Zenas was lost.\n"
"\n"
"I last received a whisper from him six months ago. Before then, it had been five years, and three before that. His thoughts are no longer intelligible in any language. Perhaps he is still in Apocrypha, lost but happy, in a trap he refuses to escape.\n"
"\n"
"I would save him if I could.\n"
"\n"
"I would silence his whispers if I could."

"디베이스 피르, 그 사람은 만나기 쉬운 사람이 아니었고 스승님에게 오블리비언의 문에 대한 비밀을 공유하기도 꺼려했다. 다행히도 우리 스승님의 전승에 대한 지식에 피르가 감동했고 스승님에게 그 방법을 가르쳐주었다. 나는 스승님이 피르와 한 약속을 깨고 여기서 그 방법에 대해 설명할 수도 있지만, 그렇다 하더라도 그 방법에 대해서는 결코 말하지 않을 것이다. 만약에 알고있는 것만으로도 위험한 지식이 이 세상에 있다면, 바로 이 방법이 그런 지식이기 때문이다. 그러나 피르의 방식은 오래 전 행방불명되어 잠정적으로 죽었으리라 여겨지는 텔바니 가문의 어느 마법사가 만들어 낸, 다양한 영역으로 갈 수 있는 일련의 차원문을 이용한다는 점 정도는 말할 수 있다. 우리는 접근 지역이 한정되어 있다는 단점에도 불구하고도 상대적으로 안정적이고 안전한 길에 더 중점을 두기로 하고, 이런 정보원과 만날 수 있었기에 운이 좋았다고 여겼다.\n"
"\n"
"모리안 제나스님은 이 세상을 벗어나 탐험을 나가셨다. 나는 도서관에 남아 그가 제공하는 정보를 받아 적었으며 스승님이 필요하시다면 연구하는 것도 도와드렸다.\n"
"\n"
"여정을 시작한 지 첫 날 스승님께서 나에게 \"흙\"이라고 말씀하신게 들렸다. 그 단어는 딱히 대단할 것 없는 평범한 단어였지만 그의 목소리에서 감출 수 없는 흥분이 내 머릿속에서 메아리치는 걸 느낄 수 있었다. \"무수한 잿빛 그림자에서 한 세상의 끝과 끝을 볼 수 있단다. 이 곳엔 땅도 하늘고 없고 오로지 떠다니고 떨어지고 내 주변에 마구 돌아다니는 입자들만 보이는구나. 마법으로 공중에 떠서 호흡해야 되겠어.\"\n"
"\n"
"제나스님은 한동안 앞도 잘 안 보이는 그 곳을 탐험하셨고, 마치 수증기같은 괴물과 연기로 이뤄진 궁전들도 목격하셨다. 비록 데이드릭 프린스를 만나지는 못하셨지만 스승님께서는 말라카스의 고향이며 분노와 배신, 깨어진 언약들이 잿가루마냥 숨막히는 대기를 채우고 있다고 하는 애쉬핏에 계신 것이라 결론지었다.\n"
"\n"
"\"하늘에 마치 불이 붙은 것 같군.\" 스승님이 다음 영역으로 이동하시면서 한 말씀이셨다. \"땅은 온통 진창이지만 그래도 지나갈 수 있단다. 사방엔 온통 검은 폐허들 뿐이군. 마치 저 먼 곳에서 전쟁이라도 일어났던 것 같구나. 공기는 매우 차갑단다. 마법으로 몸 주변을 따뜻하게 할 수는 있지만 여전히 한기가 사방에서 매섭게 찌르는 칼같이 느껴지는구나.\"\n"
"\n"
"그곳은 몰락 발이란 데이드릭 프린스가 다스리는 콜드하버였다. 스승님께선 그곳은 마치 강간의 제왕이 다스리는 황폐화되고 불모지가 되어 고통만이 존재하는 미래의 넌 같다고 하셨다. 나는 스승님께서 자신이 떠올린 그 모습에 눈물을 흘리시고, 피와 오물로 얼룩진 임페리얼 궁전을 상상하시며 몸서리치시는 것을 들을 수 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"스승님께서 다음 영역으로 발길을 돌리시자 \"너무 아름다워\"라고 하시며 목이 메이셨다. \"지금 눈이 반쯤 멀었단다. 꽃들과 폭포들과 황홀한 나무와 은빛 도시가 보이긴 하지만 흐릿하게 보이는구나. 온갖 색채들이 강물처럼 흐르는구나. 지금 비가 오는데 바람은 마치 향수같아. 이곳은 분명 아주라가 거하는 문셰도우임이 틀림없구나.\"\n"
"\n"
"스승님의 말씀이 옳았다. 그리고 더 믿을 수 없는 것은 스승님께서 해질녘과 새벽의 여왕을 그녀의 장미 가득한 궁전에서 알현할 수 있었다는 것이었다. 여왕은 미소를 지으며 스승님의 이야기를 들어주었고 스승님에게 네베바린이 온다는 것을 말해주었다. 스승님께선 문셰도우는 정말 황홀한 곳이라 여기셨고 그곳에서 눈이 반쯤 먼 채로 영원히 머무르고 싶어하셨지만 서둘러 자신의 탐험을 끝내야 한다는 것을 아셨다.\n"
"\n"
"스승님은 다음 영역으로 발을 들이시면서 \"지금 폭풍 한복판에 서 있단다\"라고 말하셨다. 스승님께선 검고 뒤틀린 나무, 울부짖는 영혼들, 피어오르는 안개가 가득한 풍경을 묘사하셨고 나는 그가 메이룬스 데이건이 다스리는 데드랜드에 들어간게 아닌가 하고 생각했다. 그러나 그 때 스승님이 돌연 말하시길 \"아니, 난 숲에 있는게 아니란다. 빛의 섬광이 보이더니 이젠 배 위에 서 있구나. 돛대는 다 찢어져 있군. 선원들은 모조리 학살당했어. 파도를 타고 무언가가 다가오고 있어... 세상에... 잠깐, 이제  어떤 축축한 동굴에 들어섰는데, 천장에는...\"\n"
"\n"
"스승님은 데드랜드에 계신게 아니라 베르니마 (Vaernima)의 악몽의 왕국인 콰그마이어 (Quagmire)에 계셨던 것이다. 매 분마다 빛의 섬광이 보이고 실체가 더욱 기괴하고 공포스러운 것으로 변하는 곳이었다. 처음엔 검은 성채였다가 굶주린 야수의 동굴로 변하더니 달빛이 비추는 늪지대로 변하고 이윽고 관으로 변하더니 스승님이 산 채로 그 안에 갇혀버렸다. 스승님은 공포심에 압도되어 버렸고 서둘러 다음 영역으로 발을 옮기셨다.\n"
"\n"
"스승님이 웃으셨다. \"마치 집처럼 편안한 느낌이 드는구나.\"\n"
"\n"
"스승님께서 무한히 펼쳐진 도서관의 모습을 묘사하셨는데, 그 곳의 선반은 사방으로 뻗쳐 있고 책 위에 책이 계속 쌓여 있었다. 책의 낱장들이 스승님도 감지 못하는 어떤 신비한 바람에 실려 떠다니고 있었다. 모든 책들은 제목이 없는 검은 표지로 되어 있었다. 그 곳에서 아무도 볼 수 없었지만 스승님은 책장을 따라 움직이며 책을 뒤지며 찾기까지 하는 유령들의 존재를 느낄 수 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"거긴 아포크리파였다. 헤르메우스-모라의 땅으로, 모든 금기된 지식들이 보존되어 있는 곳이다. 난 내 머릿속에서 전율을 느낄 수 있었으나 그것이 내 전율이었는지 스승님의 전율이었는지는 알 수가 없었다.\n"
"\n"
"스승님은 내가 알고 있는 다른 영역들은 탐험하지 않으셨다.\n"
"\n"
"처음 4 영역을 탐험하는 동안 내내 스승님은 나에게 말씀을 계속하셨다. 그러나 아포크리파에 들어서는 순간 갑자기 말이 없어지셨는데, 넌에 계신 동안 그의 마음을 움직였던 열정인 탐구와 학문으로 가득한 세상에 홀리신 것이었다. 나는 당황하여 스승님에게 계속 말씀을 걸어봤지만 스승님께선 자신의 마음을 닫아버리셨다.\n"
"\n"
"이윽고 스승님께서 \"말도 안돼...\"라고 속삭이시는걸 들었다.\n"
"\n"
"\"그 누구도 이 진실에 대해 감히 상상도 못할 것이야...\"\n"
"\n"
"\"더 배워야겠어...\"\n"
"\n"
"\"세상의 실체를 알겠어. 그저 환상일 뿐이었어. 지금 이 순간에도 우리 주변에서 계속 무너져 내리고 있어...\"\n"
"\n"
"나는 스승님에게 다시 소리쳐 무슨 일이 일어났는지 뭘 보고 계시는건지 도대체 뭘 아신건지 말 좀 해보시라고 말했다. 나는 심지어 소환마법을 사용해 스승님을 데이드라를 소환하듯이 해보기까지 했지만 스승님은 그 곳을 떠나길 거부하셨다. 스승님이 행방불명되신 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 6개월 전에 마지막으로 그분의 귓속말을 수신할 수 있었다. 그 전에는 5년 전이 마지막이었으며, 그것 또한 3년이나 지나서 받은 것이다. 그의 사고방식은 더 이상 언어로 표현할 수 없었다. 아마도 아포크리파에서 함정에 갇혀 나오실 생각도 안하시고, 비록 행방불명 상태이지만 행복한 상태로 계속 계실지도 모르겠다.\n"
"\n"
"어쩌면 서고들 사이의 틈을 통해서 쉐오고라스의 '광기의 집'로 흘러 들어가 제정신을 잃어버리신 것일지도 모른다.\n"
"\n"
"할 수만 있다면 스승님을 구하고 싶다.\n"
"\n"

"\"When thou enterest into Oblivion, Oblivion entereth into thee.\"\n"
"\n"
"— Nai Tyrol-Llar\n"
"\n"
"The greatest mage who ever lived was my master Morian Zenas.You have heard of him as the author of the book \"On Oblivion,\" the standard text for all on matters Daedric. Despite many entreaties over the years, he refused to update his classic book with his new discoveries and theories because he found that the more one delves into these realms, the less certain one is. He did not want conjecture. He wanted facts.\n"
"\n"
"For decades before and after the publication of \"On Oblivion,\" Zenas compiled a vast personal library on the subject of Oblivion, the home of the Daedra. He divided his time between this research and personal magical growth, acting on the assumption that should he succeed in finding a way into the dangerous world beyond and behind our own, he would need much power to wander its dark paths.\n"
"\n"
"Twelve years before Zenas began the journey he had prepared his life to make, he hired me as his assistant. I possessed the three attributes he required for the position: I was young and eager to help without question. I could read any book once and memorize its contents, and despite my youth, I was already a Master of Conjuration.\n"
"\n"
"Zenas too was a Master of Conjuration—indeed, a master at all the known and unknown schools of magic—but he did not want to rely on his ability alone in the most perilous of his research. In an underground vault, he summoned Daedra to interview them on their native land. For that, he needed another conjurer to make certain they came, were bound, and were sent away again without incident.\n"
"\n"
"I will never forget that vault, not for its look which was plain and unadorned, but for what you couldn't see. There were scents that lingered long after the summoned creatures had left, flowers and sulfur, sex and decay, power and madness. They haunt me still to this very day.\n"
"\n"
"Conjuration, for the layman unacquainted with its workings, connects the caster's mind with that of the summoned. It is a tenuous link, meant only to lure, hold, and dismiss, but in the hands of a master, it can be much stronger. The Psijics and Dwemer can (in the Dwemer's case, perhaps I should say \"could\") connect with the minds of others and converse miles apart: a skill that is sometimes called telepathy.\n"
"\n"
"Over the course of my employment, Zenas and I developed such a link between one another. It was accidental, a result of two powerful conjurers working closely together, but we decided that it would be invaluable should he succeed in traveling to Oblivion. Since the denizens of that land could be touched even by the skills of an amateur conjurer, it was possible we could continue to communicate while he was there, so I could record his discoveries.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Doors to Oblivion,\" as Morian Zenas would say, are not easily found. We exhausted many possibilities before we found one where we held the key.\n"
"\n"
"The Psijics of Artaeum have a place they call The Dreaming Cave, where it is said one can enter into the Daedric realms and return. Iachesis, Sotha Sil, Nematigh, and many others have been recorded as using this means, but despite many entreaties to the order, we were denied its use. Celarus, the leader of the order, told us it had been sealed off for the safety of all.\n"
"\n"
"The reader may have heard of other doors, and he may be assured we attempted to find them all.\n"
"\n"
"Some are pure legend, or at any rate, not traceable based on the information left behind. There are references in lore to Maruhk's Abyss, the Corryngton Mirror, the Mantellan Crux, the Crossroads, the Mouth, a riddle of an alchemical formula called Jacinth and Rising Sun, and many other places and objects that are said to be doors, but we could not find these.\n"
"\n"
"Some exist, but cannot be entered safely. The whirlpool in the Abecean called the Maelstrom of Bal can make ships disappear, and it may be a portal into Oblivion, but the trauma of riding its waters would surely slay any who tried. Likewise, we did not consider it worth the risk to leap from the Pillar of Thras, a thousand-foot-tall spiral of coral, though we witnessed the sacrifices the Sload made there. Some victims were killed by the fall, but some indeed seemed to vanish before being dashed on the rocks. Since the Sload did not seem certain why some were taken and some died, we did not favor the odds of the plunge.\n"
"\n"
"The simplest and most maddeningly complex way to go to Oblivion was simply to cease to be here and begin to be there. Throughout history, there are examples of mages who seemed to travel to the realms beyond ours seemingly at will. Many of these voyagers are long dead, if they ever existed, but we were able to find one still living. In a tower off Zafirbel Bay on the island of Vvardenfell in the province of Morrowind, there exists a very old, very reclusive wizard named Divayth Fyr."

"\n"
"내 스승이신 모리안 제나스 (Morian Zenas)는 역사상 가장 강력한 마법사이시다. 독자들도 '오블리비언에서'라는 데이드라 대한 모든 기본적인 소양을 집대성한 서적의 저자로서 우리 스승님의 이름을 들어보았으리라 생각한다. 그러나 몇 년동안 끈질기게 간청했음에도 불구하고 스승님께서는 새로운 발견과 이론을 바탕으로 자신의 저작을 개정하시길 거절하셨는데 왜냐면 오블리비언은 더 많은 것을 알수록 그곳에 대한 확신이 더 희박해지는 곳이기 때문이라 하셨다. 스승님은 추측이 아닌 사실을 추구하시는 분이었다.\n"
"\n"
"\"오블리비언에서\"가 출판되기 몇 십 년 전후로 해서 제나스님은 데이드라들의 고향인 오블리비언에 관한 방대한 자료를 개인적으로 모으셨다. 스승님께선 자신의 시간을 이런 자료 조사와 더불어 자신의 마법 능력을 향상시키시는데에도 할애했으며 이는 우리가 사는 세상 바깥에 존재하는 그 위험한 세계로 가는 길을 찾기 위해선 그 어두운 길을 거닐말한 힘을 지녀야 한다고 생각하셨기 때문이다.\n"
"\n"
"스승님께서 자신의 일생을 바친 여정길에 오르시기 12년 전, 나는 스승님의 조수가 되었다. 스승님께서 말씀하신 세 가지 자격을 두루 갖췄기에 가능했는데, 그 자격을 말하자면 젊고 군말없이 협력할 수 있는 자세를 갖춰야 했고, 책을 한 번 읽으면 그 내용을 기억할 수 있어야 했으며, 젊은 나이에도 불구하고 소환마법의 전문가라야야 했던 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"스승님께서도 또한 소환마법의 전문가이셨다. (실은 스승님께선 알려진 학파는 물론이고 알려지지 않은 학파에도 정통하셨다.) 그러나 스승님께선 조사 중에 맞딱드릴 위기의 순간에 자신의 능력에만 의존하실 생각은 없으셨다. 어느 지하 석실에서 스승님은 데이드라를 소환하여 그들이 사는 땅에 대해 알아내려고 하셨는데 바로 그것 때문에 소환이 성공적으로 이뤄지도록 하고 그 소환물이 확실히 구속될 수 있게 하고 별 탈 없이 다시 소환해제 할 수 있게 도와줄 또 다른 소환마법사가 필요하셨던 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"그 석실을 두고두고 잊지 못할 것이다. 결코 그 곳의 평범하고 버려진 듯한 분위기 때문이 아니라 여러분이 눈으로 볼 수 없는 무언가가 있었기 때문이다. 그 소환된 괴물이 남긴 자취는 오랫동안 진동했는데, 마치 꽃내음과 유황 냄새가 섞인 것이 정욕과 부패, 힘과 광기를 뒤섞어 놓은 듯 했다. 나는 지금 이 순간까지도 그 냄새 때문에 곤욕을 치루고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"누구든지 쉽게 알아들을 수 있도록 설명하자면, 소환마법은 마법을 사용하는 이의 정신을 소환당하는 것의 정신과 이어주는 것이라고 할 수 있다. 그 연결고리는 아주 가늘기 때문에 그저 소환물을 꾀어내고 이 세상에 붙들어 두었다가 다시 소환을 해제하기 위해서 만들어지는 것이지만, 전문가가 구사하는 것은 훨씬 더 강한 연결고리가 될 수 있다. 씨직에 소속된 이들과 드웨머들은 (이제 드웨머는 존재하지 않기에 가능'했었지만') 다른 이들의 정신과도 연결할 수 있으며 서로 먼 거리에서도 소통이 가능한데 이것이 바로 텔레파시라고 하는 능력이다.\n"
"\n"
"스승님의 조수로 일하는 동안 스승님과 나 사이에도 그런 연결고리가 생겼다. 이것은 두 강력한 소환술사가 서로 가까이 일하다 보니 생긴 우연이었지만 우리 둘은 스승님께서 오블리비언으로 성공적으로 갈 수 있다면 이 연결고리가 상당히 요긴할 것이라 결론지었다. 초보 소환술사의 기술로도 오블리비언에 거주하는 토착민에게 얼마든지 닿을 수 있었기 때문에 스승님이 오블리비언에 있는 동안에도 우리 둘은 얼마든지 소통하고 또 내가 스승님의 발견을 기록하는 것 또한 가능했던 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"스승님의 말씀을 인용하자면 \"오블리비언의 문\"은 쉬이 찾을 수 있는게 아니었다. 우리는 수많은 가능성을 실험해 본 뒤에야 우리가 이용할 수 있는 문을 찾을 수 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"아르테움의 씨직들은 드리밍 동굴이라는 곳을 알고 있었는데 그곳을 통해 데이드라의 영역을 오갈 수 있다는 소문이 있었다. 아이아체시스, 소사 실, 네마티그와 다른 이들 다수가 이 수단을 이용했다는 기록이 남아 있었으나, 씨직에 아무리 간청을 해도 그 동굴의 이용허가를 받아내지 못했다. 시직 오더의 우두머리인 셀라루스 는 안전을 위해 그곳을 봉인했다고 말했다.\n"
"\n"
"우리는 배틀스파이어 의 폐허를 통해 오블리비언에 접근하려는 생각도 했다. 비록 제국의 전투마법사들이 실력을 겨루던 훈련장은 재거 탄 시대에 폐허가 되었지만, 둑 관문 (The Weir Gate)은 여전히 남아 있었다. 그러나 애석하게도, 힘겹게 잔해 더미를 헤쳐나가며 조사를 해 본 결과 우리는 이곳이 박살났을 때 이미 오블리비언을 넘어  소울 케언, 셰이드 페릴루스, 하복 웰헤드로 가는 길은 모두 끊어졌다고 결론내렸다. 물론 이 세상엔 잘 된 일이긴 하지만 우리의 목표는 좌절되고 만 것이었다.\n"
"\n"
"여러 분들은 다른 문의 존재에 대해 들어보았을테고, 아마 우리가 그 다른 문들을 모두 찾아내려고 시도해 보았을 것이라고 확신할 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"그 소문들 중 일부는 그저 전설일 뿐이고 (어느 정도까진) 지금 남은 정보로는 추적하기도 힘든 것들이다. 전승 중에는 마리크의 어비스 코링턴 미러, 만텔란 크룩스, 크로스로드, 마우스, 그리고 자킨쓰와 라이징 선이라고 부르는 연금술 공식에 관한 수수께끼 등 오블리비언으로 갈 수 있는 물체와 장소라고 언급되는 구절들이 있지만, 우리는 그 어느 것도 찾을 수 없었다.\n"
"\n"
"확실히 존재하는 문들도 몇개인가 있었지만, 안전을 보장할 수 없는 것들이다. 발의 미엘스트람이라는 어베신의 소용돌이에서는 배 한 척이 통째로 사라지기도 하는데, 분명히  오블리비언으로 통하는 차원문일지도 모르지만 그곳을 항해할 때 수반하는 후유증은 그 방법을 시도하는 이를 사망에 이르게 할 수도 있다. 그와 같은 이유 때문에 우리는 수천 피트 높이의 나선형 산호 기둥인 트라스의 기둥에서 뛰어내리는 방법이 위험을 무릅쓰면서까지 시도할 것은 아니라고 생각했였다. 물론 슬로드들이 그곳에서 행한 희생의식을 보긴 했다. 일부 희생양은 추락사 했지만 분명 다른 일부는 바위에 부딪치기 전에 사라진 것처럼 보였다. 슬로드들도 왜 일부는 죽고 일부는 사라지는지 확신하지 못하는 눈치였고, 우리는 괜히 뛰어내리고 싶진 않았다.\n"
"\n"
"오블리비언으로 가는 가장 간단하면서도 미치도록 복잡한 방법은 그저 이 세상에서 죽어버리고 저 세상에서 새로 태어나는 것이다. 자기 마음대로 이 세상을 넘어서 여행한 마법사들이 있다는 역사상의 기록이 남아있다. 만일 그런 인물이 실존했다면 이미 오래전에 죽었겠지만, 우리는 아직 살아있는 자 한 명을 찾을 수가 있었다. 모로윈드 지방 바덴펠 섬의 자피어벨 만에서 떨어져 있는 탑에 디베이스 피르라는 이름의 세상과 동떨어져 사는 매우 오랫동안 산  마법사 말이다."

"Imperial historians, most notably Dubicius of the Colovian Highlands, speculate that Hel Ra Citadel was constructed sometime during the second Yokudan \"Warrior Wave\" as it swept into the Alik'r desert of western Tamriel. Most believe, as is obvious from its title, that it was built to protect the nearby Yokudan city, the name of which has been lost to sand and time. But the Yokudans did not name the Citadel; modern Tamriel did. The structure could have long predated the city it protects. It could have been a foothold for one or both invasions, it could have been one of many forts now lost, or even a fortressed training ground. In myth, sword saint training for maintaining \"sword magic\" was notoriously rigorous, and even an invasion force would require a space for that. Some say that where the Citadel now stands was first a Nedic fort, that the Yokudans conquered it, built on top of it.\n"

There are claims and stories, of course, all false. Imperial records state the Empire has failed to enter, and expeditions by the Redguard themselves have failed to bypass the Citadel's front door. Be it through spellcraft, or a trick of its construction, no army or siege engine has ever been able to defeat those walls. What treasures, what ancient secrets could await inside? Will the Citadel's gates ever open?\n"

"In Morrowind, both worshipers and sorcerers summon lesser Daedra and bound Daedra as servants and instruments.\n"
"\n"
"Most Daedric servants can be summoned by sorcerers for very brief periods within the most fragile and tenuous frameworks of command and binding. This fortunately limits their capacity for mischief, although in a few minutes, most of these servants can do terrible harm to their summoners, as well as their enemies.\n"
"\n"
"Worshipers may bind other Daedric servants to this plane through rituals and pacts. Such arrangements result in the Daedric servant remaining on this plane indefinitely, or at least until their bodily manifestations on this plane are destroyed, precipitating the return of their supernatural essences to Oblivion. Whenever Daedra are encountered at Daedric ruins or in tombs, they are almost invariably long-term visitors to our plane.\n"
"\n"
"Likewise, lesser entities bound by their Daedra Lords into weapons and armor may be summoned for brief periods, or they may persist indefinitely, so long as they are not destroyed and banished. The class of bound weapons and bound armors summoned by Temple followers and conjurers are examples of short-term bindings. Daedric artifacts like Mehrunes' Razor and the Masque of Clavicus Vile are examples of long-term bindings.\n"
"\n"
"The Tribunal Temple of Morrowind has incorporated the veneration of Daedra as lesser spirits subservient to the immortal Almsivi, the Triune godhead of Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec. These subordinate Daedra are divided into the Good Daedra and the Bad Daedra. The Good Daedra have willingly submitted to the authority of Almsivi. The Bad Daedra are rebels who defy Almsivi, treacherous kin who are more often adversaries than allies.\n"
"\n"
"The Good Daedra are Boethiah, Azura, and Mephala. The hunger is a powerful and violent lesser Daedra associated with Boethiah, Father of Plots—a sinuous, long-limbed, long-tailed creature with a beast-skulled head, noted for its paralyzing touch and its ability to disintegrate weapons and armor. The winged twilight is a messenger of Azura, Goddess of Dusk and Dawn. Winged twilights resemble the feral harpies of the West, though the feminine aspects of the winged twilights are more ravishing, and their long, sharp, hooked tails are immeasurably more deadly. Spider Daedra are the servants of Mephala, taking the form of spider-humanoid centaurs, with a naked upper head, torso, and arms of human proportions, mounted on the eight legs and armored carapace of a giant spider. Unfortunately, these Daedra are so fierce and irrational that they cannot be trusted to heed the commands of the Spinner. As a consequence, few sorcerers are willing to either summon or bind such creatures in Morrowind.\n"
" \n"
"The Bad Daedra are Mehrunes Dagon, Malacath, Sheogorath, and Molag Bal. Three lesser Daedra are associated with Mehrunes Dagon: the agile and pesky scamp, the ferocious and beast-like clannfear, and the noble and deadly Dremora. The crocodile-headed humanoid Daedra called the daedroth is a servant of Molag Bal, while the giant but dim-witted ogrim is a servant of Malacath. Sheogorath's lesser Daedra, the golden saint, a half-clothed human female in appearance, is highly resistant to magic and a dangerous spellcaster.\n"
" \n"
"Another type of lesser Daedra often encountered in Morrowind is the atronach, or Elemental Daedra. Atronachs have no binding kinship or alignments with the Daedra Lords, serving one realm or another at whim, shifting sides according to seduction, compulsion, or opportunity."

Though the plant-matter fibers imbue your soul, the wretched plankton would pollute the cloth until it stank to heavens of prophecy.

How did that happen?\n"

In time you see your brothers and sisters, burnings of their own in the distance and along your side. A sea of pinpoints, a constellation of memories. Each burns bright, then flickers.

"\n"
"이 경우 도토리는 일종의 나무의 알이고, 지식은 물과 태양이다. 우리는 달걀 안의 닭이지만, 흙이기도 하다.  엘더 스크롤의 지식은 우리가 우리 자신을 완전히 인식하기 위해 밀어내는 것이다.\n"

"당신이 지금껏 접한 지식의 충격으로 마음을 영원히 닫아버리기 전에 마지막으로 상상해보자. 당신은 이제 광대한 무 속에서 밝게 불타오르는 푸른 불꽃이다.  곧 당신은 당신의 형제들과 자매들이 멀리서 당신을 따라 불타오르는 것을 본다. 진리의 바다이자 기억의 무리이다. 모두가 밝게 빛나고,  곧 가물거리며 사라진다. 사라진 자리에는 두 개가 새로 자란다. 하지만 영원하지는 않다, 사고를 흡수하는 부정한 빛이 나머지를 채우는 것을 방지할 뿐이다.\n"
"\n"
"우리의 정신은 실제로는 비어있고,  스크롤의 지식이 바로 진리이다. 그 날카로운 빛이 없으면, 공허가 무지 바로 그 자체인 것을 모른다면, 나의 자아 또한 아무것도 아니다. 하지만 타오르는 불길은 위험하며, 아주 조심스럽게 여기고 다른 이들에게 전달되어야 할 것이다.\n"

"No one—not the oldest Dark Elf of Mount Dagoth-Ur or the Ancient Sage of Solitude himself—can recall a time when the Orc did not ravage our fair Tamriel. Whatever foul and pestilent Daedra of Oblivion conjured them up could scarcely have created a more constant threat to the well-being of the civilized races of Tamriel than the obnoxious Orc.\n"
"\n"
"Orcs are thankfully easy to recognize from other humanoids by their size—commonly forty pertans in height and fifteen thousand angaids in weight—their brutal pig-like features, and their stench. They are consistently belligerent, morally grotesque, intellectually moronic, and unclean. By all rights, the civilized races of Tamriel should have been able to purge the land of their blight eras ago, but their ferocity, animal cunning, and curious tribal loyalty have made them inevitable as leeches in a stagnant pool.\n"
"\n"
"Tales of Orcish barbarity precede written record. When Jastyaga wrote of the Order of Diagna's joining the armies of Daggerfall and Sentinel \"to hold at bay the wicked Orcs in their foul Orsinium fastness … and burn aught in cleansing flame\" in 1E 950, she assumed that any reader would be aware of the savagery of the Orcs. When the siege was completed thirty years later, after the death of many heroes including Gaiden Shinji, and the destruction of Orsinium scattered the Orcish survivors throughout the Wrothgarian Mountains, she further wrote, \"The free peoples rejoiced for that their ancient fell enemy was dispersed into diverse parts.\" Obviously, the Orcs had been terrorizing the region of the Iliac Bay at least since the early years of the First Era."

"Ffoulke's Preferred Text\n"
"by Ffoulke\n"
"\n"
"The Stars of Tamriel are divided into thirteen constellations. Three of them are the major constellations, known as the Guardians. These are the Warrior, the Mage, and the Thief. Each of the Guardians protects its three Charges from the thirteenth constellation, the Serpent.\n"
"\n"
"When the sun rises near one of the constellations, it is that constellation's season. Each constellation has a season of approximately one month. The Serpent has no season, for it moves about in the heavens, usually threatening one of the other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"The Warrior\n"
"\n"
"The Warrior is the first Guardian Constellation, and he protects his charges during their seasons. The Warrior's own season is Last Seed, when his Strength is needed for the harvest. His Charges are the Lady, the Steed, and the Lord. Those born under the sign of the Warrior are skilled with weapons of all kinds, but prone to short tempers.\n"
"\n"
"The Mage\n"
"\n"
"The Mage is a Guardian Constellation whose season is Rain's Hand, when Magicka was first used by men. His Charges are the Apprentice, the Golem, and the Ritual. Those born under the sign of the Mage have more Magicka and talent for all kinds of spellcasting, but are often arrogant and absent-minded.\n"
"\n"
"The Thief\n"
"\n"
"The Thief is the last Guardian Constellation, and her season is the darkest month of Evening Star. Her Charges are the Lover, the Shadow, and the Tower. Those born under the sign of the Thief are not typically thieves, though they take risks more often than others and only rarely come to harm. They will run out of luck eventually, however, and so rarely live as long as those born under other signs.\n"
"\n"
"The Serpent\n"
"\n"
"The Serpent wanders about in the sky and has no season, though its motions are predictable to a degree. No characteristics are common to all who are born under the sign of the Serpent. Those born under this sign are the most blessed and the most cursed.\n"
"\n"
"The Lady\n"
"\n"
"The Lady is one of the Warrior's Charges and her season is Heartfire. Those born under the sign of the Lady are kind and tolerant.\n"
"\n"
"The Steed\n"
"\n"
"The Steed is one of the Warrior's Charges, and her season is Mid Year. Those born under the sign of the Steed are impatient, always hurrying from one place to another.\n"
"\n"
"The Lord\n"
"\n"
"The Lord's season is First Seed, and he oversees all of Tamriel during the planting. Those born under the sign of the Lord are stronger and healthier than those born under other signs.\n"
"\n"
"The Apprentice\n"
"\n"
"The Apprentice's season is Sun's Height. Those born under the sign of the apprentice have a special affinity for magic of all kinds, but are also more vulnerable to magic.\n"
"\n"
"The Atronach\n"
"\n"
"The Atronach (often called the Golem) is one of the Mage's Charges. Its season is Sun's Dusk. Those born under this sign are natural sorcerers with deep reserves of Magicka, but they cannot generate Magicka of their own.\n"
"\n"
"The Ritual\n"
"\n"
"The Ritual is one of the Mage's Charges, and its season is Morning Star. Those born under this sign have a variety of abilities depending on the aspects of the moons and the Divines.\n"
"\n"
"The Lover\n"
"\n"
"The Lover is one of the Thief's Charges and her season is Sun's Dawn. Those born under the sign of the Lover are graceful and passionate.\n"
"\n"
"The Shadow\n"
"\n"
"The Shadow's season is Second Seed. The Shadow grants those born under her sign the ability to hide in shadows.\n"
"\n"
"The Tower\n"
"\n"
"The Tower is one of the Thief's Charges, and its season is Frostfall. Those born under the sign of the Tower have a knack for finding gold and can open locks of all kinds."

"탐리엘의 별들은 13개의 별자리로 나눌 수 있다. 그 중 3개는 대성좌로, '수호자들' 이라고 불리고 있다. 대성좌는 전사 (Warrior), 마법사 (Mage), 도적 (Thief) 이며, 이 수호자들은 각각 3개씩의 별자리를 13번째의 별자리인 뱀으로부터 수호하고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"태양이 이러한 별자리 중 어느 하나로 가장 가까이 접근하게 되었을 때가 그 별자리의 계절이 된다. 별자리는 각각 약 1개월의 계절을 가지게 된다. 단, 뱀의 별자리는 계절을 가지지 않고, 끊임없이 천공을 휘저으며 다른 별자리들을 위협하며 돌고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"전사\n"
"\n"
"전사의 별자리는 제1의 수호자이며, 그의 곁에 있는 별자리를 지키고 있다. 전사의 계절은 수확철인 8월인데. 그의 힘이 수확에 필요하기 때문이다.  그가 수호하는 별자리는 숙녀 , 준마 ,그리고 군주이다. 전사의 별자리에 태어난 자는 모든 종류의 무기에 능숙하지만, 때때로 성격이 급한 경향을 보인다.\n"
"\n"
"마법사\n"
"\n"
"마법사의 별자리는 4월을 자신의 계절로 하는 수호자의 별자리이다. 4월은 처음으로 사람이 마법을 사용했던 달이다. 그가 수호하는 별자리는 견습생, 정령, 그리고 의식이다. 마법사의 별자리에 태어난 자는 매지카를 많이 가지게 되고, 마법의 재능이 뛰어나 모든 종류의 주문을 잘 다룰 수 있게 되지만, 가끔 거만한 모습을 보이고 한가지에 너무에 열중해 주변상황에 대한 판단에 약한 경향이 있다.\n"
"\n"
"도적\n"
"\n"
"도적의 별자리는 제３수호자이며, 주관하는 계절은 가장 어두운 12월이다. 수호하는 별자리는 연인, 그림자, 탑이다. 도적의 별자리에 태어난 자는 반드시 도적이 되는것은 아니지만, 위험을 무시하고 행동하는 성향이 강하고, 자신이 저지른 행위에 대한 보복이나 책임은 적을 것이라고 생각하는 자가 많다. 그렇지만 자신의 뜻대로 되는 그 행운은 점차 약해지기 때문에,  이 별자리에 태어난 자는 다른 별자리에 태어난 자보다 짧은 인생을 가지는 경우가 많다.\n"
"\n"
"뱀\n"
"\n"
"뱀의 별자리는 정해진 계절을 가지지 못한채로, 천공을 방랑하며 떠돈다. 방랑이라고는 하지만 그 움직임은 어느정도 예상이 가능하다. 독사의 별자리로 태어난 자만의 특징적인 모습은 없다. 따라서 이 별을 가지는 자는 가장 축복된 자가 될 수도, 혹은 가장 저주받은 자가 될 수도 있는 운명이다.\n"
"\n"
"숙녀\n"
"\n"
"숙녀의 별자리는 전사의 별자리 아래에 위치하는 별자리의 하나로, 9월의 계절을 맡고 있다. 숙녀의 별자리에 태어난 자는, 친절하며 너그럽다.\n"
"\n"
"준마\n"
"\n"
"준마의 별자리는 6월을 주관하는 전사의 수호하에 있는 별자리의 하나이다. 준마의 별자리에 태어난 인간은 성급하며, 항상 여기저기를 서둘러 돌아다니게 된다.\n"
"\n"
"군주\n"
"\n"
"군주의 별자리의 계절은 3월로, 매년 3월에 탐리엘 전 국토를 바라보는 역할을 가지고 있다. 군주의 별자리 아래에서 태어난 자는 다른 별자리에 태어난 자보다 훨씬 강하고 건강한 몸을 가진다.\n"
"\n"
"견습생\n"
"\n"
"주관하는 계절은 설정상 사람이 처음으로 마법을 사용했다는 4월. 같은 대성좌인 전사, 도적과 함께 다른 별자리를 13번째 별자리인 뱀으로부터 지키는 수호자라고 불린다. 견습생, 정령, 의식을 수호하는 별자리이다. 많은 매지카와 마법의 재능을 가지고 태어나지만 가끔 거만한 모습을 보이며, 한가지에 집중해서 주변상황에 대한 판단이\n"

"\n"
"의식\n"
"\n"
"의식의 별은 마술사의 별자리의 아래에 위치하는 1월을 주관하는 별자리이다. 이 표시를 받아 태어난 사람은 달과 신들의 힘을 받아 다양한 재능을 가지고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"연인\n"
"\n"
"연인은 도적의 별자리에 의해 지켜지는 별의 하나로, 2월을 주관한다. 이 별 아래에서 태어난 사람은 우아하고 정열적이다.\n"
"\n"
"그림자\n"
"\n"
"그림자 별자리의 계절은 5월이다. 그림자의 별자리는 그 아래에서 태어난 자에게 그림자에 잠복하는 능력을 부여한다.\n"
"\n"
"탑\n"
"\n"
"탑의 별자리는 도적의 별자리에 수호되는 별자리의 하나로, 그 계절은 10월이다. 이 별자리에서 태어난 사람은 선천적으로 돈이 따르고, 어떤 종류의 잠긴 문이라도 열 수 있다."

"The prisoner called for me today, and I had the dubious privilege of listening to his confession. Separated from him by narrow iron bars that I knew would be insufficient to protect me, I took down his words with a trembling hand.\n"
"\n"
"What follows is my best rendering, although he was so soft-spoken that at times I had to guess at the precise words. Nevertheless, I am confident that what follows accurately represents the substance of our conversation:\n"
"\n"
"\"I accepted this curse at a young age. I was impressionable. My packleader was a family friend and elder in our village. I wanted to be strong, and I relished the strength the curse gave me. I would not have called it a curse, then.\n"
"\n"
"\"But with youth comes recklessness, and I was not good at disguising what I was. Eventually they discovered my true nature, and I was driven from the village.\n"
"\n"
"\"My packleader failed me. He did not protect me. He cared too much about his own status to risk it for my sake. I was alone.\n"
"\n"
"\"Everywhere I went I heard the shouts of crowds, saw the bright torches of the angry mob. I never lingered long in one place before my secret was discovered. \n"
"\n"
"\"I came to hate them. The superstitious villagers.  I came to resent what I couldn't have. I blamed them for my own recklessness. It was not the curse that plagued me, but the narrow-mindedness of these provincial men and women.\n"
"\n"
"\"I was afraid to hunt, so I was always hungry, and the hunger turned me feral. It was in this state that I came across them. A family of innocent farmers, just like the innocent farmers that had hounded me from village after village. My vision turned red and I flew into a fury.\n"
"\n"
"\"At last my hunger was satisfied. \n"
"\n"
"\"But when the rage subsided and I looked on what I'd done, my stomach turned. This was what all those villagers were afraid of, when they tormented me with their torches and sickles.\n"
"\n"
"\"That's when I acknowledged my curse for what it was. I have hunted many years since, afraid to turn myself in, but disgusted with my base impulses. \n"
"\n"
"\"You don't realize what a great favor you have done, capturing me.\"\n"

"By Cinna Scholasticus\n"
"\n"
"The disease vampirism is not one disease, but many. Throughout the centuries, and for unknown reasons, the afflictions collectively known as vampirism have been transmitted in different ways and taken on different qualities. Herein, I shall try to delineate, to the best of my ability, the qualities of the form of vampirism common to our era, known as Noxiphilic Sanguivoria, so as to better equip the reader to identify this type of vampire.\n"
"\n"
"First, however, I believe a word of warning is in order. This work is in no way intended as a guide to hunting or otherwise confronting a vampire. In all cases, it is advised that you avoid anyone you suspect of vampirism and certainly that you do not try to fight them. Vampires of all varieties possess supernatural strength and will quickly overpower all but the most experienced hunter.\n"
"\n"
"The most important thing to remember about sufferers of Noxiphilic Sanguivoria is that, as the name implies, they are not weakened by daylight as in other strains of vampirism, but are, instead, strengthened during the nighttime hours. \n"
"\n"
"Why this is the case is poorly understood. One of the more wild theories is that it is the result of some sort of Daedric backroom deal between Hircine and Molag Bal that has given sufferers of Noxiphilic Sanguivoria a werewolf-like love of moonlight.\n"
"\n"
"By night, these hunters are possessed of extreme fortitude and a powerful ability to recover from wounds.\n"
"\n"
"Sufferers of Noxiphilic Sanguivoria, interviewed under heavy sedation, of course, have described a dreamlike passage from when they were first bitten and afflicted with the disease. Some of them have described entering a ritual chamber where they were bathed in a pool of black blood. Whether the transformation actually involves such a terrifying ritual, or whether it was merely a hallucination is impossible to discern without firsthand experience.\n"
"\n"
"If you are bitten, or believe to have been bitten, by a carrier of Noxiphilic Sanguivoria, do not panic. If you are able to get away from your attacker, see a priest of Arkay immediately. You will not contract full Noxiphilic Sanguivoria without first being exsanguinated by a vampire and then receiving the gift of his or her blood in return."

"The Merethic Era was figured by early Nord scholars as a series of years numbered in reverse order backward from their \"beginning of time\": the founding of the Camoran Dynasty, recorded as Year Zero of the First Era. The prehistoric events of the Merethic Era are listed here with their traditional Nord Merethic dates. The earliest Merethic date cited by King Harald's scholars was ME 2500, the Nord reckoning of the first year of time. As such, the Merethic Era extends from ME 2500 in the distant past to ME 1, the year before the founding of the Camoran Dysnasty and the establishment of the White-Gold Tower as an independent city-state.\n"
"\n"
"According to King Harald's bards, ME 2500 was the date of construction of the Adamantine Tower on Balfiera Island in High Rock, the oldest known structure of Tamriel. (This corresponds roughly to the earliest historical dates given in various unpublished Elven chronicles.)\n"
"\n"
"During the early Merethic Era, the aboriginal beast-peoples of Tamriel (the ancestors of the Khajiit, Argonians, Orcs, and other beastfolk) lived in preliterate communities throughout Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"In the Middle Merethic Era, the Aldmeri refugees (mortals of Elven origin) left their doomed, now-lost continent of Aldmeris (also known as \"Old Ehlnofey\") and settled in southwestern Tamriel. The first colonies were distributed at wide intervals on islands along the entire coast of Tamriel. Later inland settlements were founded primarily in fertile lowlands in southwest and central Tamriel. Wherever the beastfolk encountered the Elves, the sophisticated, literate, technologically advanced Aldmeri cultures displaced the primitive beastfolk into the jungles, marshes, mountains, and wastelands. The Adamantine Tower was rediscovered and captured by the Direnni, a prominent and powerful Aldmeri clan. They built Crystal Tower on Summerset Isle and, later, the White-Gold Tower in Cyrodiil.\n"
"\n"
"During the Middle Merethic Era, Aldmeri explorers mapped the coasts of Vvardenfell, building the First Era High Elven wizard towers at Ald Redaynia, Bal Fell, Tel Aruhn, and Tel Mora in Morrowind. It was also during this period that Ayleid (Wild Elven) settlements flourished in the heartland surrounding White-Gold Tower (in present-day Cyrodiil). Wild Elves, also known as the Heartland High Elves, preserved the Dawn Era magics and language of the Ehlnofey. Ostensibly a tributary to the High King of Alinor, the Heartland's long lines of communication from the Summerset Isles' sovereignty effectively isolated Cyrodiil from the High Kings at Crystal Tower.\n"
"\n"
"The Late Middle Merethic Era is the period of the High Velothi Culture. The Chimer, ancestors of the modern Dunmer, or Dark Elves, were dynamic, ambitious, long-lived Elven clans devoted to fundamentalist ancestor worship. The Chimer clans followed the Prophet Veloth out of the ancestral Elven homelands in the southwest to settle in the lands now known as Morrowind. Despising the secular culture and profane practices of the Dwemer, the Chimer also coveted the lands and resources of the Dwemer, and for centuries provoked them with minor raids and territorial disputes. The Dwemer (Dwarves), free-thinking, reclusive Elven clans devoted to the secrets of science, engineering, and alchemy, established underground cities and communities in the mountain range (later the Velothi Mountains) separating modern Skyrim and Morrowind.\n"
"\n"
"The Late Merethic Era marks the precipitous decline of Velothi culture. Some Velothi settled in villages near declining and abandoned ancient Velothi towers. During this period, Velothi high culture disappeared on Vvardenfell Island. The earliest Dwemer Freehold colonies date from this period. Degenerate Velothi devolved into tribal cultures which, in time, either evolved into the modern Great Houses of Morrowind or persisted as the barbarian Ashlander tribes. The only surviving traces of this tribal culture are scattered Velothi towers and Ashlander nomads on Vvardenfell Island. The original First Era High Elven wizard towers along the coasts of Tamriel were also abandoned around this time.\n"
"\n"
"In the Late Merethic Era, pre-literate humans, the so-called \"Nedic Peoples,\" migrated from the continent of Atmora (also \"Altmora\" or \"the Elder Wood\" in Aldmeris) and settled in northern Tamriel. The Nord culture hero Ysgramor, leader of a great colonizing fleet to Tamriel, is credited with developing a runic transcription of Nord speech based on Elvish principles, and so Ysgramor is considered the first human historian. Ysgramor's fleet landed at Hsaarik Head at the extreme northern tip of Skyrim's Broken Cape. The Nords built the legendary city of Saarthal there. The Elves drove the Men away during the Night of Tears, but Ysgramor soon returned with his Five Hundred Companions.\n"
"\n"
"Also during the Late Merethic Era, a legendary immortal hero, warrior, sorcerer, and king (variously known as Pelinal Whitestrake, Harrald Hairy Breeks, Ysmir, and Hans the Fox) wandered Tamriel. He gathered armies, conquered lands, ruled them, and then abandoned his kingdoms so he could wander again."

"\n"
"신화 시대는 초기 노드 학자들에 의해, 캐모런 왕조의 건국으로 제1시대의 0년으로 기록된 '시대의 시작'로부터 거슬러 수를 세는 일련의 연도로 계산되어 졌습니다. 메레식 시대의 역사기록 이전 사건들은 전통적 노드 연대와 함께 여기에 나열하였습니다. 해랄드 왕의 학자들에 의한 인용된 가장 빠른 신화시기의 연대는 ME2500년 -- 시대의 첫해에 대한 노드의 추정 -- 입니다. (노드의 추정에 따른 시간의 원년. 이에 따라, 신화의 시대는 ME2500으로부터 ME1 - 캐모런 왕조가 설립되고 백금탑이 건축되던 해- 까지로 알려짐)\n"
"\n"
"해랄드 왕의 음유시인들에 따르면, ME2500년은 높은 바위로 된 발피라 (Balfiera) 섬 위에 탐리엘에 가장 오래된 것으로 알려진 건축물인 아다만타인 탑이 건설된 시기입니다. (이것은 여러 출판되지 않은 엘프 연대기에서 등장하는 가장 오래된 역사적 시기와 대략 일치합니다.)\n"
"\n"
"초기 신화 시대 동안, 탐리엘의 토착 수인들 (beastpeoples) -- 카짓 (Khajiit), 아르고니안 (Argonian), 오크 (Orcish) 및 기타 수인족들의 조상들 -- 은 탐리엘 도처에서 비문명 사회를 이루며 살고 있었습니다.\n"
"\n"
"중기 신화 시대에, 알드메리 (= Aldmeri, 엘프 필멸자의 기원) 피난민들이 그들의 불운했던 고향, 현재 사라져 버린  ('Old Ehlnofey'로 알려진) 알드메리스 (Aldmeris) 대륙을 떠나 탐리엘 남서쪽에 정착했습니다. 최초의 식민지는 탐리엘 해안을 따라 있는 섬에 넓은 간격으로 분포되었습니다. 이후 내륙 정착지들은 주로 서남쪽 과 탐리엘 중앙의 비옥한 저지대에 세워졌습니다. 엘프들은 곳곳에 세련되고, 교양있는, 선진 기술을 가진 알드메리 문화를 퍼뜨리고 정글, 습지, 산과 황무지에 있던 원시 수인족을 바꿔 놓았습니다. 그 아다만타인 탑은 재 발견되어 유명하고 강력한 알드메리 일족인 디레니에 의해 점령되었습니다. 수정탑이 섬머셋 섬에 세워지고, 이후 시로딜 내에 백금 탑이 건설되었습니다.\n"
"\n"
"신화 시대 중기, 알드메리 모험가들은 바덴펠 해안 지도를 만들고, 제1시대 하이 엘프 마법사 탑을 알드 레디나 발 펠 텔 아룬 과 모로윈드 내에 텔 모라 (Tel Mora)를 건설하였습니다. 이 기간에도 에일리드정착지들은 백금탑 (오늘 날의 Cyrodiil) 을 둘러싼 정글 안에서 번성하였습니다. 하트랜드 하이 엘프로 알려진, 야생 엘프들은 여명 시대 마법과 (엘페노이) 언어를 유지하고 있었습니다. 표면상으론 알리노어의 제왕에게 복속된 땅이었지만, 하트랜드가 존재한 덕분에 섬머셋 섬과 시로딜간의 거리는 크리스털 탑의 제왕의 시로딜에 적절한 영향력을 행사하기 어렵게 만들었습니다.\n"
"\n"
"중기 신화 시대 후반은 하이 벨로시문명의 시기입니다. 다크 엘프 혹은, 근대 던머의 조상인 카이머는 활동적이고, 패기만만했으며, 근본주의 조상 숭배를 따르는 수명이 긴 엘프 종족이었습니다.카이머들은 현재 모로윈드로 알려진 땅에 정착하기 위해 남서부 조상 엘프의 고향의 예언자인 벨로시를 따라 갔습니다. 세속적인 문화와 드웨머의 불경한 관행을 경멸한, 카이머들은 드웨머의 땅과 자원을 탐냈고, 몇세기에 걸쳐 소소한 약탈과 영토분쟁으로 그들을 자극했습니다. 자유로운 발상으로, 공학, 연금술, 과학의 비밀에 헌신한 은둔자적인 엘프 일족, 드워프들은 근대 스카이림과 모로윈드를 구분짓는 산맥 내부에 지하 도시와 공동체를 세웠습니다.\n"
"\n"
"후기 신화 시대는 벨로시 문명이 급격히 감소하는 것이 눈에 띕니다. 일부 벨로시는 쇠퇴하고 버려진 고대 탑 근처에 정착했습니다. 이 기간 동안, 벨로시의 순수 문명은 바덴펠 섬에서 사라졌습니다. 가장 오래된 드웨머의 자유 정착지는 이 시기로부터 거슬러 올라갑니다. 벨로시는 부족 문명 - 모로윈드의 현대 대저택에 적용된 혹은 바바리안 애쉬랜더  부족들에 이어지는 - 으로 쇠퇴했습니다. 이 부족 문화의 살아남은 흔적은 흩어진 벨로시 탑과 바덴펠 섬 내 애쉬랜더 유목민들 뿐 입니다. 원시형태의 제1시대 하이엘프 마법사 탑은 탐리엘 해안을 따라 이 시기에도 황폐한 상태로 버려져 있었습니다.\n"

"후기 신화 시대에 아트모라 ( = Atmora, 'Altmora' 혹은 알드메리에서는 '오래된 숲')의 대륙으로부터 소위 \"네딕 민족 \"이라 불리는 비문명 인간들이 이주해와 탐리엘 북부에 정착합니다. 탐리엘으로 향하는 대규모 식민지 함대의 지도자이자, 노드 문화의 영웅인 이스그래머는 엘프의 원칙에 근거해 기초한 노드 언어의 룬문자 전문을 개발하는데 성공했습니다. 그래서, 이스그래머가 최초의 인간 역사가로 간주됩니다. 이스그래머의 함대는 스카이림의 해안 돌출지형들 중 북쪽 끝에 있는 사릭 헤드에 상륙했습니다. 노드들은 그곳에 전설 속의 도시인 사아쌀 을 건설했습니다. 엘프들이 눈물의 밤 기간 동안 사람들을 몰아냈지만, 이스그래머는 곧 500명의 동료들과 돌아왔습니다.\n"

"by Aicantar of Shimmerene\n"
"\n"
"Before man came to rule Tamriel, and before the chronicles of the historians recorded the affairs of the rulers of Tamriel, the events of our world are known only through myths and legends, and through the divinely inspired teachings of the Eight Divines.\n"
"\n"
"For convenience, historians divide the distant ages of prehistory into two broad periods of time: the Dawn Era and the Merethic Era.\n"
"\n"
"The Dawn Era\n"
"\n"
"The Dawn Era is that period before the beginning of mortal time, when the feats of the gods take place. The Dawn Era ends with the exodus of the gods and magic from the World at the founding of the Adamantine Tower.\n"
"\n"
"The term \"Merethic\" comes from the Nords, literally, \"Era of the Elves.\" The Merethic Era is the prehistoric time after the exodus of the gods and magic from the World at the founding of the Adamantine Tower and before the arrival of Ysgramor the Nord in Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"The following are the most notable events of the Dawn Era, presented roughly in sequence as it must be understood by creatures of time such as ourselves.\n"
"\n"
"The Cosmos formed from the Aurbis (chaos, or totality) by Anu and Padomay. Akatosh (Auriel) formed and Time began. The gods (et'Ada) formed. Lorkhan convinced (or tricked) the gods into creating the mortal plane, Nirn. The mortal plane was at this point highly magical and dangerous. As the gods walked, the physical make-up of the mortal plane and even the timeless continuity of existence itself became unstable.\n"
"\n"
"When Magic (Magnus), architect of the plans for the mortal world, decided to terminate the project, the gods convened at the Adamantine Tower (Direnni Tower, the oldest known structure in Tamriel) and decided what to do. Most left when Magic did. Others sacrificed themselves into other forms so that they might stay (such as the Ehlnofey). Lorkhan was condemned by the gods to exile in the mortal realms, and his heart was torn out and cast from the tower. Where it landed, a volcano formed. With magic (in the Mythic Sense) gone, the cosmos stabilized. Elven history, finally linear, began (ME 2500)."

"By Gabrielle Benele, Daggerfall Mages Guild\n"
"\n"
"As a former member of the faculty at the University of Gwylim, I take an interest in matters of practical pedagogy, and I've spent the last two seasons reviewing our Mages Guild curricula for the instruction of beginning spellcasters. This body of work has accumulated gradually over several centuries, and as a result it is somewhat haphazard and disorganized. \n"
"\n"
"After casting about for a model upon which to reorganize our teaching texts, I came upon the curriculum of the Shad Astula Academy in Morrowind, where they teach magic in eight different disciplines. Though the divisions between the disciplines, or \"schools\" of magic, are rather arbitrary, magic being an entirely mutable art, this classification of spellcasting into schools of magic has the advantage of providing students with a structure for easy comprehension of the basics of wizardry. The proof of its value is the fact that Shad Astula graduates novice mages with a practical grasp of sorcery in half the time of our own introductory program.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, I propose that we adopt the Shad Astula disciplines, and reorganize the Mages Guild study program into the following schools of magic:\n"
"\n"
"ALCHEMY: The study of the magical virtues of different forms of matter, their effects, combinations, and recombinations. To include the concoction of potions, elixirs, and magical draughts.\n"
"\n"
"ALTERATION: The distortion of local reality through direct imposition of the mage's will. To include spells of paralysis, water breathing, water walking, lock opening, and personal elemental shields such as flame cloaks. \n"
"\n"
"CONJURATION: The summoning and binding of spirits from Oblivion or Aetherius. To include soul trapping, spells that conjure Daedra or other creatures, spells to banish same, summoning of bound weapons and armor, as well as (for classification purposes) the forbidden necromantic arts of reanimation, conjuration, and manipulation of the undead. \n"
"\n"
"DESTRUCTION: The splintering of material bonds by the direct application of force, typically elemental in nature. To include damaging spells of flame, frost, shock, and disintegration, as well as magic that drains essence or personal attributes.\n"
"\n"
"ILLUSION: Altering perception in oneself or others. To include spells of light, invisibility, fear, frenzy, and silence, as well as magic that affects morale and obedience. \n"
"\n"
"MYSTICISM: The class of spells used to alter the nature of magic itself. To include effects that dispel or absorb both spells and the magicka that feeds them, as well as telekinesis (which fits here as well as anywhere).\n"
"\n"
"RESTORATION: The opposite of destruction, magic that resists damage or restores wholeness by reknitting the damaged material. To include wards, healing, curing of disease and poison, physical fortification, and the turning of undead (a forced purification effect).\n"
"\n"
"THAUMATURGY: Magic that affects the will and personal state of mind. To include spells that calm or charm others, reflection of or resistance to magic, as well as levitation, which involves the personal rejection of gravity. \n"
"\n"
"The experienced mage will immediately discern the arbitrary nature of these divisions—indeed, we may eventually find it advisable to combine one or more of these schools, assigning the spells within them to other categories. (Thaumaturgy seems a likely candidate for such amalgamation, and possibly Mysticism, as well.) However, these schools seem to be serving Shad Astula well, so I propose we tentatively adopt them as is, and refine as we go."

"By Beredalmo the Signifier\n"
"\n"
"Since time immemorial, devout mortals of Tamriel have built shrines to their Divines at sites that have been recognized as holy and sanctified. Many of these sites were chosen due to specific miracles or blessed events that marked them, though others simply inspire feelings of reverence for matters divine. Because they are located here and there where inspiration struck, rather than at points of convenience, these sites are scattered across the land, and have come to be known as \"wayshrines.\" \n"
"\n"
"Of course, the shrines built at these sites by devout worshipers reflect the local religious beliefs, and are constructed and adorned so as to honor the foremost local Divines. Many priesthoods believe that wayshrines act as direct conduits to Aetherius, and that when a mortal dies his or her soul is drawn to the nearest wayshrine, where it meets some sort of psychopomp or spiritual escort, who leads the soul to the afterlife. Though this is a mystical matter and therefore not susceptible to scholarly proof, it is striking that so many different faiths across Tamriel endorse this belief. \n"
"\n"
"As all know, the stars in the heavens are perforations in the Mundus through which shines the magical light of Aetherius. Lord Corvus Direnni theorized that the locations of wayshrines on Tamriel correspond to the pattern of stars in the night sky, because our Mundus is a reflection of Aetherius. However, to test this theory we would need a comprehensive map of every wayshrine site on Tamriel, a task too daunting to contemplate, so proof of this hypothesis, if true, will have to come from another source. \n"
"\n"
"Lord Corvus was also a renowned conjurer, who devised and promulgated the standard \"portal\" spells now popularized by the Mages Guild. (His work was based on the pioneering research of the Ayleid sorcerer known to history as \"The Transmigrant.\" But that is liquor for a different cocktail.) Corvus theorized that, if one only knew how, the wayshrines could be used as a permanent portal network by which one could travel rapidly across Tamriel. He speculated that such a \"fast traveler\" would need to somehow attune himself to a wayshrine, which would add its \"node\" to the traveler's \"web of sojourn.\"\n"
"\n"
"However, in order to learn how to do this, the great Direnni wizard believed a mortal's soul would have to be, temporarily or permanently, \"unmoored from the Mundus.\" I am not at all certain what that phrase means, and if Lord Corvus understood it, none of his written memoirs explain what he meant by it. Based on my studies of the notebooks left behind in Lord Corvus' workshop in Direnni Tower, proof and implementation of this theory eluded him, and eventually he abandoned it to return to perfecting variations on Koron's Peremptory Summons."

"Mages Guild Memorandum: Confidential, Magisters Only\n"
"\n"
"From Vanus Galerion, Archmagister Emeritus\n"
"\n"
"If you pay attention to the popular fads and fashions of spellcasting in your guildhalls, you have doubtless noticed the recent surge of interest in the discipline of \"soul trapping.\" Unlike most of the passing fancies that come and go among the magical fraternity, I consider this particular vogue alarming and dangerous. \n"
"\n"
"There are reasons why soul trapping has never been part of the core curriculum of the Mages Guild, taught to only the most experienced and dependable wizards, and then only for certain specific uses. First of all, it is technically a subset of necromancy, and on that basis alone it should be abhorred. (Except, as mentioned, for certain special cases, and then only under controlled conditions.) Second, it is a magical technology that practically invites abuse, especially when employed to trap the souls of sentient mortals. It is the sort of arcane practice that the public fears most, and is likely to result in local bans on the organized teaching of magic, and if that happens all our work in establishing the Guild will have been in vain. \n"
"\n"
"The fact that soul trapping is now common knowledge among Tamriel's magery, to the point where so-called \"Mystics\" sell soul gems of various sizes in every market and bazaar, is a problem that can be laid squarely at the feet of the iniquitous Mannimarco and his Order of the Black Worm. It is all part of his program to make necromancy seem commonplace and almost harmless. In some parts of Tamriel, notably Cyrodiil, the vile practice of necromancy has even become accepted as a valid, and legally tolerated, magical discipline. What our old mentor Iachesis would have to say about this pernicious development I hate to think. \n"
"\n"
"So what are we to do about it? I have been giving the matter some hard thought, in between rooting out cells of the ever-burgeoning Worm Cult, and I think at this point the only way to gain control over soul-trapping is to co-opt the practice. Therefore I propose the Mages Guild codify and systematize the various soul-trapping magics into a common grimoire of a few reliable spells, and then teach our members that these, and only these, are the legal and authorized methods for trapping souls. \n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, I propose that for the purposes of soul trapping we categorize all souls into two classes: the legal, or \"White\" souls, those smaller essences that are captured from beasts and animals, and illegal, or \"Black\" souls, which are derived from sentient mortals. And we will teach only those spells that can capture White souls, forbidding our students to use the larger soul gems on sentients. \n"
"\n"
"It will take several generations, and the suppression of the Worm Cult, for this dichotomy to become the pan-Tamrielic standard for soul trapping. But if the Mages Guild can't take the long view for the good of Tamriel, who can?"

"It is easy to confuse Illusion and Alteration. Both schools of magic attempt to create what is not there. The difference is in the rules of nature. Illusion is not bound by them, while Alteration is. This may seem to indicate that Alteration is the weaker of the two, but this is not true. Alteration creates a reality that is recognized by everyone. Illusion's reality is only in the mind of the caster and the target.\n"
"\n"
"To master Alteration, first accept that reality is a falsehood. There is no such thing. Our reality is a perception of greater forces impressed upon us for their amusement. Some say that these forces are the gods, others that they are something beyond the gods. For the wizard, it doesn't really matter. What matters is the appeal couched in a manner that cannot be denied. It must be insistent without being insulting.\n"
"\n"
"To cast Alteration spells is to convince a greater power that it will be easier to change reality as requested than to leave it alone. Do not assume that these forces are sentient. Our best guess is that they are like wind and water. Persistent but not thoughtful. Just like directing the wind or water, diversions are easier than outright resistance. Express the spell as a subtle change and it is more likely to be successful."

"변화를 익히기 위해서는 먼저 현실은 허위라는 사실을 받아들여야 한다. 현실은 없다. 우리의 현실은 우리에게 인상을 주는 거대한 힘에 대한 인식이다. 몇몇은 이러한 힘이 신이라 이야기 하고 다른 몇몇은 신을 뛰어넘은 그 이상의 것이라 말한다. 마법사에게 있어서 그것은 실질적으로 중요하지 않다. 중요한 것은 부정할 수 없는 방법에 놓여진 수단이다. 그것은 반론할 수 없는 주장이다.\n"
"\n"
"변화 마법을 사용한다는 것은 현실을 그대로 두는 것보다 마음먹은대로 바꾸는 것을 쉽게 만드는 힘에 대해 확신하는 것이다. 이러한 힘들을 지각할 수 있을거라고 여기지는 말라. 그저 바람이나 물같은 것이라고 생각하는편이 좋을 것이다.  영구적이지만 의지를 가진 것은 아니다. 바람이 부는 방향처럼, 물이 흐르는 방향처럼, 변화는 완벽한 저항보다는 쉽다. 약간씩 변화를 주면서 마법을 사용하는 편이 성공하기 쉬울 것이다."

"On the Detachment of the Sheath from the Integument\n"
"\n"
"By Arch-Prelate Fervidius Tharn\n"
"\n"
"Though all given Concavities, or sheaths within the integument of the Aurbis, are necessarily contained by the Aurbis, Right Reaching dictates that a defined sheath may be detached from the integument by invocation of Mnemoli. Upon intercourse with the star-orphan, the Beseeching Alesstic performs eversion of the organ of thought, an employment of the Hurling Disk that recapitulates the truth that a circle turned sidewise is a Tower. By same-truth, twisting the enveloping sheath into the middle dawn (to the number of seventeen) brings it to untime and unplace.\n"
"\n"
"Eventualism, of course, predicts reabsorption upon depletion of the Wheeling Force, but the absence of duration may render even eventuality moot."

"Customs and Philosophy of Grave and Faithful Counsel\n"
"\n"
"by Celarus the Loremaster\n"
"\n"
"We who know the Old Ways are well aware of the existence of a spiritual world invisible to the unenlightened. Just as one living in a kingdom but unaware of the political machinations underneath may see a new tax or battle preparation as the caprices of fortune, many observe floods, famines, and madness with helpless incomprehension. This is deplorable. As the great Cuilean Darnizhaan moaned, \"The power of ignorance can shatter ebony like glass.\"\n"
"\n"
"What, after all, is the origin of these spiritual forces that move the invisible strings of Mundus? Any neophyte of Artaeum knows that these spirits are our ancestors—and that, while living, they too were bewildered by the spirits of their ancestors, and so on back to the original Acharyai. The Daedra and gods to whom the common people turn are no more than the spirits of superior men and women whose power and passion granted them great influence in the afterworld.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly this is our truth and our religion. But how does it help us in our sacred duty of seliffrnsae, or providing \"grave and faithful counsel\" to lesser men?\n"
"\n"
"Primarily, it is easy to grasp the necessity both of endowing good men with great power and making powerful men good. We recognize the multiple threats that a strong tyrant represents—breeding cruelty which feeds the Daedra Boethiah and hatred which feeds the Daedra Vaermina; if he should die having performed a particularly malevolent act, he may go to rule in Oblivion; and worst of all, he inspires other villains to thirst after power and other rulers to embrace villainy. Knowing this, we have developed patience in our dealings with such despots. They should be crippled, humiliated, impoverished, imprisoned. Other councilors may advocate assassination or warfare—which, aside from its spiritual insignificance, is expensive and likely to inflict at least as much pain on the innocents as the brutish dictator. No, we are intelligence gatherers, dignified diplomats—not revolutionaries.\n"
"\n"
"How, then, are our councilors \"faithful?\" We are faithful only to the Old Ways—it is essential always to remember the spiritual world while keeping our eyes open in the physical one. Performing the Rites of Moawita on the 2nd of Hearth Fire and the Vigyld on the 1st of Second Seed are essential means of empowering salutary spirits and debilitating unclean ones. How, then, are we at once faithful to those we counsel and to the Isle of Artaeum? Perhaps the sage Taheritae said it best: \"In Mundus, conflict and disparity are what bring change, and change is the most sacred of the Eleven Forces. Change is the force without focus or origin. It is the duty of the disciplined Psijic [\"Enlightened One\"] to dilute change where it brings greed, gluttony, sloth, ignorance, prejudice, cruelty… [here Taheritae lists the rest of the 111 Prodigalities], and to encourage change where it brings excellence, beauty, happiness, and enlightenment. As such, the faithful counsel has but one master: his mind. If the man the Psijic counsels acts wickedly and brings oegnithr [\"bad change\"] and will otherwise not be counselled, it is the Psijic's duty to counterbalance the oegnithr by any means necessary [emphasis mine].\"\n"
"\n"
"A student of the Old Ways may indeed ally himself to a lord—but it is a risky relationship. It cannot be stressed enough that the choice be wisely made. Should the lord refuse wise counsel and order the Psijic (to use Taheritae's outmoded word) to perform an act contrary to the teachings of the Old Ways, there are few available options. The Psijic may obey, albeit unwillingly, and fall prey to the dark forces against which he has devoted his life. The Psijic may abandon his lord, which will bring shame on him and the Isle of Artaeum, and so may never be allowed home again. Or the Psijic may simply kill himself."

" 무지한 자들에게는 보는 것조차 불가능한 영적인 세계의 존재는 고전 풍습을 아는 우리에게는 너무나도 당연한 사실이다. 마치 왕국에 살면서 그것을 지탱하는 정치에 대해 모르는 자들이 새로운 세금이나 전쟁의 준비를 우연으로 일어난 불운으로 오해하듯이 많은 자들이 홍수나 굶주림 그리고 혼란에 대해 이해하지 못하면서도 무력한 것이다. 이것은 한탄스러운 사실이면서 위대한 쿠일린 다니잔 (Cuilean Darnizhaan)께서 말씀하신 것 처럼 \"무지의 힘은 에보니를 유리처럼 부숴버린다\" 그 자체이다.\n"
"\n"
"문두스의, 눈에 보이지 않는 실을 움직이는 이 영적인 힘의 근원이란 무엇인가? 아르테움 (Artaeum)에서 배우기 시작한지 얼마되지 않은 자라도 그 영적존재가 우리들 조상이며 그 조상 또한 생전에 자신들의 조상을 영적 존재로서 신비하게 받아들였으며, 그 조상 또한 아카리아이 (Acharyai)로 거슬러 올라갈 때까지 반복되어 왔다는 것을 안다. 데이드라나 신들을 따랐던 사람들이 더 우수한 그 힘과 정열을 가졌기 때문에 내세에서 영혼이 된 뒤에 강한 영향력을 유지할 수 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"분명히 이것이 우리들에게 있어서 진실이자, 종교다. 다만 우리들이 하등한 자들에게 엄격하며 신앙심깊은 조언을 주는 성스러운 일을 할 때, 또 셀리프른세이 (seliffrnsae)의 때에는 우리에게 어떤 도움이 될것인가.\n"
"\n"
"먼저, 선인이 강대한 힘을 갖추는 것과 힘있는 자가 선인다움 갖추는 것에 대한 필요성은 어느쪽도 쉽게 이해할 수 있다. 우리는 강대한 폭군이 만들어낸 여러 위험을 인지하고 있다. 잔혹함은 데이드라 보에시아의 양식이 되고 증오는 데이드라 베르미나의 양식이 된다. 특히 악의가 담긴 행동을 한 뒤에 죽었을 경우, 오블리비언에서 권력의 자리에 앉게 될 가능성이 있다. 이것이 무엇보다도 문제가 되는 것은 다른 악인에게도 힘을 갈망하게끔 만들어 악행에 손을 물들이도록 만드는 존재가 된다는 점이다. 이 점을 염두에 두고, 우리들은 이러한 폭군을 다룰 때 유용한 대처법을 만들어 냈다. 대상은 힘을 빼았기고 수치심에 빠지며 부를 빼았기고 자유를 빼았기게된다. 암흑과 전쟁을 제안하는 목소리도 있을지 모르지만, 후자는 영적으로는 의미가 없는데다가 막대한 비용이 들기에 잔혹한 폭군 뿐만 아니라 죄 없는 자들까지 같은 고통을 받게 될지도 모른다. 우리의 일은 정보를 모으는 것이며, 긍지높은 조정자로서의 일이지 반란을 선동하는 일이 아니다.\n"
"\n"
"그렇다면 우리의 조언자은 어떻게 신앙심이 깊을 수 있는 것인가. 그것은 우리들이 유일하게 고대 풍습에 충실하기 때문이다. 현실세계에서 눈을 뜨는 것과 동시에 영적세계의 존재를 잊지 않도록 항상 되새기는 것이 중요하다. 모와이타 (Moawita) 의식을 9월 2일에 행하고, 비길드 (Vigyld) 의식을 5월 1일에 행하는 것은 유익한 영혼에게 힘을 주어 부정한 영혼을 무력화 시키는 데에 불가결한 방법이다. 그래서, 우리는 어떻게 조언의 대상과 아르테움 섬 양쪽에 대해 충성을 지킬 수 있는 것인가. 현자 타헤리테 (Taheritae)의 대답이 가장 합당한 답변일 것이다. \"문두스에게는 분쟁과 불균형이야 말로 변화를 가져다 주는 것이며, 변화라 함은 11가지 힘 중에서도 가장 신성한 것이다. 변화라 함은 초점의 근원도 가지지 않는 힘이다. 식욕, 대식, 태만, 무지, 편견, 잔학... [타헤리타에는 여기서 111가지 무의미한 것들을 열거했다.] 들을 가지고 오는 변화를 억압하고, 미덕, 아름다움, 기쁨, 그리고 계몽을 가져다주는 변화를 장려하는 것이 계율을 아는 씨직 (Psijic)의 임무이다. 따라서, 신앙심 깊은 조언자가 따라야 할 유일한 것은 자신의 정신이다. 씨직이 조언을 주는 상대가 악행에 빠져 에그니스(악한 변화)를  불러들이거나, 조언을 들으려 하지 않을 경우 모든 수단을 동원해 에그니스를 상쇄시키는 것이 씨직의 임무이다 [편집자의 강조].\n"
"\n"
"고전 풍습을 배우는 자는 언젠가 주군과 맹약을 맺을 수 있으나, 그러한 관계에는 그만한 위험이 따른다. 현명한 판단이 필요함을 여기에서도 강조해 두겠다. 주군이 현명한 조언을 받아들이지 못하고 씨직 (타헤리타에의 이 고풍스런 말을 인용했다)에게 낡은 방식에 반하는 행동을 구할 경우, 선택할 수 있는 길은 적다. 씨직은 어쩔 수 없이 명령에 따라 자신의 평생을 다하여 싸우겠다고 결의한 어둠의 힘의 먹이가 되어버린다. 또, 씨직은 주군을 버리고 자기자신과 아르테움 섬에 불명예를 가져와 두번 다시는 섬에 돌아갈 수 없는 몸이 될 수도 있다. 혹은, 씨직이 그저 자결할 수도 있다."

"The Beginning Spellcaster\n"
"\n"
"The most powerful mages in Tamriel were once beginners. They all had similar early experiences: exposure to magic kindled an interest or unlocked some latent ability, followed by years of hard work. These intrepid souls honed their skills, learned new spells, and vigorously trained their minds and bodies to become the formidable figures they were known as during their later lives.\n"
"\n"
"The Mages Guild of Tamriel has long been the first stop on a long road to knowledge and power for many individuals. Providing magical services to the general public, the Guild offers a wide variety of spells for purchase, and is recommended as a first stop for any aspiring spellcaster. Independent dealers may be found, though their selection of spells is often not as comprehensive as that of the Mages Guild.\n"
"\n"
"Many spells are beyond the capabilities of beginning mages; the ability to render one's self invisible, for example, is an advanced power and is beyond the novice spellcaster. Through practice, a mage may become more skilled in a given school of magic and find himself proficient enough to begin exploring its more powerful aspects. The fledging mage should not be daunted by his inability to wield certain powers, but should instead use this as a point of focus and a drive for bettering himself. Rather than becoming discouraged, the student should look forward to higher levels of skill, such as the advanced techniques of absorbing spells, summoning lesser (and eventually greater) Daedra and undead—for research purposes only—and protection against specific types of spells, such as Flame, Frost, and Shock spells.\n"
"\n"
"Mages wishing to specialize in a particular school of magic are encouraged to learn as many spells as possible within that school, and to practice them frequently. All mages, whether specializing or nurturing a general interest, are encouraged to apply for membership within the Mages Guild. Beyond services available to the general public, the accomplished Guild member has access to many exclusive services. These services have been deemed potentially dangerous to the public at large, and have been restricted to higher-ranked Guild members in good standing by the Council of Mages.\n"
"\n"
"Citizens interested in the further use of magic should consult their local Mages Guild Magister."

"by Zeroli Jarol\n"
"\n"
"The ancient Ayleids believed that Nirn was composed of four basic elements—earth, water, air, and light—and of these four elements, they believed the most sublime form of light was starlight. The stars are our links to the plane of Aetherius, the source of all magical power, and therefore, light from the stars is the most potent and exalted of all magical powers.\n"
"\n"
"From time to time, fragments of Aetherius fall from the heavens. The people know these fragments as \"shooting stars,\" and from time to time, such Aetherial fragments are found on Nirn. The most common varieties are known as \"meteoric iron\"; this metal is prized by armorers and enchanters for its properties in the forging of enchanted weapons and armors. This meteoric iron is also the primary component in \"Ayleid Wells,\" ancient enchanted artifacts found throughout Cyrodiil.\n"
"\n"
"Another, rarer form of Aetherial fragment is called \"meteroic glass.\" It is from such fragments that other rare Ayleid enchanted artifacts are crafted; namely, Welkynd Stones and Varla Stones.\n"
"\n"
"Ayleid Wells are scattered across Cyrodiil's landscape. They remain a mystery, as they are not associated with any known Ayleid cities or settlements. It is presumed that in some manner, they harvest magical power from starlight. It is also suggested without evidence or support that they are located at the meeting points of ancient lines of magical power; however, modern arcane arts have discovered no perceptible evidence of such lines of power.\n"
"\n"
"Those with magical talents can draw magicka from Ayleid Wells to restore their own reservoirs of magical power. No ritual or arcane knowledge is necessary, suggesting that these wells were designed to serve persons not skilled in the magical arts. Once drained, the wells replenish again only at magical midnight. Once recharged, they appear to radiate magical power back into the sky, which prompts some to theorize they are also objects with religious or magical ritual significance, perhaps a means of offering magic back to the heavens.\n"
"\n"
"Welkynd Stones (in Aldmeris: \"sky stone,\" \"heaven stone,\" or literally, \"sky child\") are pieces of cut and enchanted meteoric glass which apparently act as storage devices for magical power. A magical talent can restore his reservoirs of magicka from such stones. Alas, the means of restoring power to these stones may have been lost with the Ayleids. Currently, these objects simply crumble to dust after they have been used.\n"
"\n"
"Great Welkynd Stones are exceptionally large pieces of enchanted meteoric glass. Scholars believe that at the heart of each ancient Ayleid city, a Great Welkynd Stone was the source of the settlement's magical enchantments. It may be that these great stones were linked to the lesser stones, restoring and maintaining their power. In any case, research on these Great Welkynd Stones is impossible, since all the known Ayleid ruins have been looted of their great stones, and no examples of these great stones are known to survive.\n"
"\n"
"Another rare enchanted item found in Ayleid ruins is called a Varla Stone (in Aldmeris: \"star stone\"). Varla Stones are remarkably powerful, enabling untrained users to restore magical energy to any number of enchanted items. Because of their great value and utility, these items are also extremely rare, but since they are small and easily concealed, diligent explorers may still occasionally come across them in any Ayleid ruin.\n"
"\n"
"Ayleid Wells, Welkynd Stones, and Varla Stones—consider these marvels of magical enchantment. Are we then to conclude that the Ayleids were a superior race and culture? Did they so exceed us in art and craft that they mock the feeble powers of Second Era Wizards?\n"
"\n"
"Never! The Ayleids were powerful, yes, and cunning, but they were neither good nor wise, and so they were struck down. Their works have passed from Nirn, save these rare and sparkling treasures. Their ancient cities are dark and empty, save for the grim revenants and restless spirits condemned forever to walk the halls, keeping their melancholy vigils over bones and dust."

" 고대의 에일리드인들은 넌 (Nirn)이 네가지의 기초 원소로 구성되어 있다고 믿었다 -- 땅, 물, 공기 그리고 빛 -- 그리고 이 네가지 원소들중, 가장 지고한 형태는 별빛이라고 믿었다. 별은 우리를 모든 마법적 힘의 근원인, 아테리우스 (Aetherius)의 차원으로 연결시켜준다, 따라서 별로부터 나오는 빛은 모든 마법적 힘중에서 가장 강력하고 고귀한 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"가끔, 아테리우스의 조각들이 하늘로부터 떨어진다. 사람들은 이것을 '별똥별'이라고 알고있고, 가끔, 이런 아테리우스 조각들이 넌에서 발견되고 있다. 이 중 가장 흔한 형태는 '운철'로 알려져 있다; 이 금속은 마법 무기와 방어구를 단조함에 있어서 그것의 특성때문에 병기 제조자와 마법사들로부터 귀하게 여겨진다. 또한 이 금속은 시로딜 전역에서 발견되는 고대의 마법 유물인 '에일리드 우물'의 주요 구성물이다.\n"
"\n"
"또 다른, 아테리우스 조각중 흔치 않은 형태는 '유성의 글래스'이다. 그 조각들로부터 다른 형태의 희귀한 에일리드 마법 유물이 만들어진다 -- 바로 윌킨드 스톤과 발라 스톤이다.\n"
"\n"
"에일리드 우물은 시로딜 전역에 흩어져있다. 그 위치는 수수께이이다; 그 위치는 알려져있는 에일리드 도시나 정착지와 관련이 있는것이 아니다. 그것은 어떤 방식으로 별빛으로부터 마법적 힘을 얻기 위한 것으로 추정된다. 또한 그곳은 별다른 단서나 증거도 없이, 마법적 힘을 가진 고대 장치들의 일치점에 위치해있다는 의견을 내기도 한다; 그러나, 현대 아케인의 기술은 그러한 힘을 가진 기계장치를 감지해낼만한 증거를 발견해내지 못했다.\n"
"\n"
"마법에 재능을 가진 자들은 마법 에너지의 저장소를 복원시키기 위한 에일리드 우물로부터 매지카를 얻어낼 수 있다. 어떤 의식이나 아케인에 대한 지식도 필요치 않다, 이 우물은 마법기술에 대해 훈련되지 않은 사람들을 돕기 위해 설계되었다. 일단 고갈이 되면, 우물은 오직 마력이 충만한 자정의 순간에만 다시 보충이 된다. 이렇게 충전이 되고나면, 그것은 마법에너지를 다시 하늘로 내뿜는 것으로 보인다, 이는 그것들이 종교적 혹은 마법적 의식의 의미를 가지는 장소이기도 하다는 이론을 제시하도록 만든다 -- 아마도 천상의 세계로 마법을 되돌려주기 위한 방법일 것이라고 말이다.\n"
"\n"
"웰킨드 스톤 [알드머리스 - \"하늘의 돌\", \"천상의 돌\"; 직역하면, \"하늘의 아이\"] 은 마법의 힘을 저장하기 위한 장치로써 동작하는 것으로 보이는 마법 강화된 유성의 글래스를 잘라낸 조각이다. 마법의 재능이 있는 사람은 그 돌로부터 자신의 매지카를 회복시킬수가 있다. 애석하게도, 이 돌의 힘을 복원시키는 방법은 에일리드인들과 함께 잊혀져버렸다. 현재, 이 물건은 사용되고 나면 바스러져 가루가 되어버린다.\n"
"\n"
"그레이트 웰킨드 스톤은 마법 강화된 유성 글래스의 유난히 큰 조각이다. 학자들은 그것이 각 고대 아엘레이드 도시의 심장이고, 정착지의 마법 강화물들의 근원이라고 믿는다. 이 거대한 돌이 작은 돌들과 연결되어있고, 그것들의 힘을 복원시키고 유지시키는 것일지도 모른다. 어쨌든, 그레이트 웰킨드 스톤에 대한 연구는 불가능하다, 에일리드 유적으로 알려진 모든 곳의 그 거대한 돌들이 전부 약탈당했고, 이것들이 남아있는 것으로 알려진 곳은 어디에도 없기 때문이다.\n"
"\n"
"에일리드 유적에서 발견되는 또다른 희귀한 마법적 물건은 발라 스톤이라 불려지는 것이다 [알드머리스 - \"별의 돌\"]. 발라 스톤은 아주 강력하다, 훈련되지 않은 사용자들에게도 많은 마법적 물품들의 에너지를 회복시켜 줄 수가 있다. 이런 크나큰 가치와 유용성 때문에, 이 물건은 굉장히 희귀하지만, 그리 찾기 어려운 곳에 숨겨진 것은 아니기 때문에, 근면한 탐험자들은 가끔씩 에일리드 유적에서 그것을 마주칠수 있을 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"에일리드 우물. 웰킨드 스톤. 발라 스톤. 그럼, 생각해보라, 이 마법적 강화물의 경이로움을. 에일리드인이 우수한 문화를 가진 뛰어난 종족이라는 결론을 내릴수 있는가? 그들이 3시대의 마법사들의 허약한 힘을 조롱할 만큼 예술적, 기술적으로 우리를 훨씬 뛰어넘었었는가?\n"
"\n"
"결코 그렇지 않다! 물론, 에일리드인들은 강력했고, 교활했다, 하지만 그들은 선하지도 현명하지도 않았고, 그리하여 그들은 무너져내렸다. 그들의 업적은 이러한 희귀하고 흥미로운 보물들을 제외하고, 넌에서 사라져버렸다. 그들의 고대 도시는 뼈와 먼지를 지키기 위해, 화랑을 거닐며 영원히 잠들지 못하도록 명받은 음산한 망령과 영혼들을 제외하고는, 어둠과 공허만 남아있다.\n"

"Transliminal passage of quickened objects or entities without the persistent agency of hyperagonal media is not possible, and even if possible, would result in instantaneous retromission of the transported referents. Only a transpontine circumpenetration of the limen will result in transits of greater than infinitesimal duration.\n"
"\n"
"Though other hyperagonal media may exist in theory, the only known transliminal artifact capable of sustained transpontine circumpenetration is the sigil stone. A sigil stone is a specimen of pre-Mythic quasi-crystalline morpholith that has been transformed into an extra-dimensional artifact through the arcane inscription of a Daedric sigil. Though some common morpholiths like soul gems may be found in nature, the exotic morpholiths used to make sigil stones occur only in pocket voids of Oblivion and cannot be prospected or harvested without Daedric assistance.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, since both the morpholiths and the Daedric sigils required for hyperagonal media cannot be obtained without traffic and commerce with Daedra Lords, it is necessary that a transliminal mechanic cultivate a working knowledge of conjuration—though purpose-built enchantments may be substituted if the mechanic has sufficient invocatory skill. Traffic and commerce with Daedra Lords is an esoteric but well-established practice, and lies outside the compass of this treatise. [1]\n"
"\n"
"Presuming a sigil stone has been acquired, the transliminal mechanic must first prepare the morpholith to receive the Daedric sigil.\n"
"\n"
"Let the mechanic prepare a chamber, sealed against all daylight and disturbances of the outer air, roofed and walled with white stone and floored with black tiles. All surfaces of this chamber must be ritually purified with a solution of void salts in ether solvent.\n"
"\n"
"A foursquare table shall be placed in the center of the room, with a dish to receive the morpholith. Four censers shall be prepared with incense compounded from gorvix and harrada. On the equinox, the mechanic shall then place the morpholith in the dish and intone the rites of the Book of Law, beginning at dawn and continuing without cease until the sunset of the same day.\n"
"\n"
"The mechanic may then present the purified morpholith to the Daedra Lord for his inscription. Once inscribed with the Daedra Lord's sigil, the morpholith becomes a true sigil stone, a powerful artifact that collects and stores arcane power—similar in many respects to a charged soul gem, but of a much greater magnitude. And it is this sigil stone that is required to provide the tremendous arcane power necessary to sustain the enchantment that supports the transpontine circumpenetration of the limen.\n"
"\n"
"To open a gate to Oblivion, the mechanic must communicate directly, by spell or enchantment, with the Daedra Lord who inscribed the sigil stone in question. The Daedra Lord and the mechanic jointly invoke the conjurational charter [2], and the mechanic activates the charged sigil stone, which is immediately transported through the liminal barrier to the spot where its sigil was inscribed, thus opening a temporary portal between Mundus and Oblivion. This portal may only remain open for a brief period of time, depending on the strength of the liminal barrier at the chosen spots, several minutes being the longest ever reported, so the usefulness of such a gate is quite limited.\n"

"따라서 다른 차원으로 뛰어넘는 매개체를 만드는 것에 필요한 요소인 모폴리스와 데이드릭이 없다면, 다시 말해서, 데이드릭의 군주들과의 교류 및 교역 없이는 불가능하므로, 차원을 넘나들고자 하는 사람은 차원관문을 소환하기 위해 실용적인 지식을 기를 필요가 있다 -- 그 사람이 마법에 관한 능력이 충분히 있다면, 소환용으로 만들어진 대용품을 사용하는 것도 가능하다. 데이드릭의 군주들과의 교류 및 교역은 소수만 이해하는 일이기는 하지만 잘 알려진 시도이며, 본문이 의도하는 내용에는 해당하지 않는다. [1]\n"

"태양의 빛, 그리고 바깥 공기를 모두 차단해서, 특수한 목적으로 만들어진 천장과 벽, 및 검은 타일을 친 마루를 갖춘 방을 준비한다. 이 방의 모든 표면은 에테르 용매에 담근 공허의 소금 용액으로 반드시 의식적으로 맑게 해야 한다.\n"
"\n"
"모폴리스를 받기 위한 그릇을 정사각형 테이블에 놓고, 테이블은 방의 중앙에 설치한다. 4개의 낚시 향로에는 고빅스 (Gorvix)와 하라다 (Harrada)를 섞은 향을 준비한다. 사용자는 밤과 낮을 정확히 반으로 나눈 시간에 그릇 속에 모폴리스를 넣어 새벽부터 중단하는 일 없이 그날의 일몰까지 '질서의 책' 의식을 영창한다.\n"
"\n"
" 그 후, 사용자는 정화된 모폴리스에 비문을 받기 위해서 데이드릭의 군주들에게 서신을 보낸다. 데이드릭 군주들의 증표를 새겨 둔 후, 모폴리스는 신비의 힘을 채취하고, 저장하는 강력한 비밀스러운 보물, 즉, 진정한 의미의 '인장석'이 된다. -- 여러 가지 관점에서 보자면 소울젬과 유사하지만, 이것은 한층 더 큰 규모이다. 그리고, '의식의 한계'에서 차원관문을 만들기 위해선 마법의 지속이 꼭 필요한데, 이 마법을 지속하기 위해 막대한 신비의 힘을 공급하려면 이 '인장석'이 반드시 필요하다.\n"
"\n"
" 오블리비언의 문을 열기 위해서는, 사용자가 부가마법 또는 마법을 이용하고, '인장석'에 데이드릭 군주들의 증표를 새겨 직접 교신할 필요가 있다. 데이드릭 군주들과 사용자는 서로 연대해서 소환의 계약을 행사해 [2], 사용자가 '인장석'을 발동시킨다. 이것에 의해서, 문두스와 오블리비언의 사이에 일시적인 차원 관문이 열려, '인장석'은 즉각적으로 '의식의 한계'의 장벽을 넘고, 증표가 새겨진 장소로 이동한다. 그 선택된 장소에 있는 의식의 한계와 장벽의 강도에 따라서 이 차원관문이 계속 열리고 있는 시간은 상당히 짧을 가능성이 있다. 지금까지의 보고서에 의하면 문이 열려 있는 시간은 몇 분정도가 최대치이므로 이 문의 실용성은 매우 한정되어 있다.\n"

"FORM THE FIRST: Makest thou the Mana Fountain to be Primed with Pure Gold, for from Pure Gold only may the Humors be rectified, and the Pure Principles coaxed from the chaos of Pure Power. Droppest thou then the Pure Gold upon the surface of the Mana Fountain. Takest thou exceeding great care to safeguard yourself from the insalubrious tempests of the Mana Fountain, for through such Assaults may one's health be utterly Blighted.\n"
"\n"
"FORM THE SECOND: Make sure that thou havest with you this Excellent Manual, so that thou might speak the necessary Words straightaway, and without error, so that thou not in carelessness cause thyself and much else to discorporate and disorder the World with your component humors.\n"
"\n"
"FORM THE THIRD: Take in hand the item to be Restored, and hold it forth within the Primed Fountain, murmuring all the while the appropriate phrases, which are to be learned most expeditiously and faultlessly from this Manual, and this Manual alone, notwithstanding the vile calumnies of Kharneson and Rattor, whose bowels are consumed by envy of my great learning, and who do falsely give testament to the efficacies of their own Manuals, which are in every way inferior and steeped in error.\n"
"\n"
"FORM THE FOURTH: Proceed instantly to Heal thyself of all injuries, or to avail yourself of the Healing powers of the Temples and Healers, for though the agonies of manacaust must be borne by any who would Restore a prized Arcana to full Potency, yet it is not wise that suffering be endured unduly, nor does the suffering in any way render the Potency more Sublime, notwithstanding the foolish speculations of Kharneson and Rattor, whose faults and wickednesses are manifest even to the least learned of critics."

"\n"
"네번째: 즉시 너의 상처를 회복하라. 사원과 치유사들에게서 치료를 받을수도 있다. 그러나 마나카우스트는 아르카나 를 효능으로 가득차게 할 사람에게서 이루어져야 할 것이다. 그러나 여전히 과도하게 상처입는 것은 현명하지 못하다. 또한 효능을 과도하게 남용하여서도 안된다. 배우지 못한 비평가의 비판이나 저급한 사색으로도 카네슨과 래터의 잘못과 결점은 명백하다."

"Little boys shouldn't summon up the forces of eternal darkness unless they have an adult supervising, I know, I know. But on that sunny night on the 5th of First Seed, I didn't want an adult. I wanted Hermaeus Mora, the Daedra of knowledge, learning, gums, and varnishes. You see, I was told by a beautiful, large-breasted man who lived under the library in my home town that the 5th of First Seed was Hermaeus Mora's night. And if I wanted the Oghma Infinium, the Book of Knowledge, I had to summon him. When you're the new King of Solitude, every bit of knowledge helps.\n"
"\n"
"Normally, you need a witches coven, or a mages guild, or at least matching pillow case and sheets to invoke a prince of Oblivion. The Man Under the Library showed me how to do it myself. He told me to wait until the storm was at its height before shaving the cat. I've forgotten the rest of the ceremony. It doesn't matter.\n"
"\n"
"Someone appeared who I thought was Hermaeus Mora. The only thing that made me somewhat suspicious was Hermaeus Mora, from what I read, was a big blobby multi-eyed clawed monstrosity, and this guy looked like a waistcoated banker. Also, he kept calling himself Sheogorath, not Hermaeus Mora. Still, I was so happy to have successfully summoned Hermaeus Mora, these inconsistencies did not bother me. He had me do some things that didn't make any sense to me (beyond the mortal scope, breadth, and ken, I suppose), and then his servant happily gave me something he called the Wabbajack. Wabbajack. Wabbajack.\n"

"Hircine's Tale\n"
"\n"
"Ever proud and boastful, Oblivion's Mad Prince stood one fifth day of mid year among the frigid peaks of Skyrim, and beckoned forth Hircine for parlay. The Huntsman God materialized, for this was his day, and the boldness of Sheogorath intrigued him.\n"
"\n"
"Wry without equal, Sheogorath holds in his realm giggling loons, flamboyant auteurs, and craven mutilators. The Mad Prince will ply profitless bargains and promote senseless bloodshed for nothing more than the joy of another's confusion, tragedy, or rage. So it was that Sheogorath had set a stage on which to play himself as rival to Hircine.\n"
"\n"
"Without haste, the coy Prince proffered his contest; each Prince was to groom a beast to meet at this place again, three years to the hour, and do fatal battle. Expressionless behind his fearsome countenance, Hircine agreed, and with naught but a dusting of snow in the drift, the Princes were gone to their realms.\n"
"\n"
"Confident, but knowing Sheogorath for a trickster, Hircine secretly bred an abomination in his hidden realm. An ancient Daedroth he summoned, and imbued it with the foul curse of lycanthropy. Of pitch heart and jagged fang, the unspeakable horror had no peer, even among the great hunters of Hircine's sphere.\n"
"\n"
"In the third year, on the given day, Hircine returned, where Sheogorath leaned, cross-legged on a stone, whistling with idle patience. The Prince of the Hunt struck his spear to the ground, bringing forth his unnatural, snarling behemoth. Doffing his cap, sly as ever, Sheogorath stood and stepped aside to reveal a tiny, colorful bird perched atop the stone. Demurely it chirped in the bristling gusts, scarcely audible.\n"
"\n"
"In a twisted, springing heap, the Daedroth was upon the stone, leaving only rubble where the boulder had been. Thinking itself victorious, the monster's bloodied maw curled into a mock grin, when a subdued song drifted in the crisp air. The tiny bird lightly hopped along the snout of the furious Daedroth. Sheogorath looked on, quietly mirthful, as the diminutive creature picked at a bit of detritus caught in scales betwixt the fiery eyes of the larger beast. With howling fury, the were-thing blinded itself trying to pluck away the nuisance. And so it continued for hours, Hircine looking on in shame while his finest beast gradually destroyed itself in pursuit of the seemingly oblivious bird, all the while chirping a mournful tune to the lonesome range.\n"
"\n"
"Livid, but beaten, Hircine burned the ragged corpse and withdrew to his realm, swearing in forgotten tongues. His curses still hang in those peaks, and no wayfarer tarries for fear of his wrathful aspect in those obscured heights.\n"
"\n"
"Turning on his heel, Sheogorath beckoned the minuscule songbird to perch atop his shoulder, and strolled down the mountain, making for the warm breezes and vibrant sunsets of the Abecean coast, whistling in tune with the tiniest champion in Tamriel."

" 긍지있고 과시하기 좋아하는,6월의 다섯번째날 몹시 추운 스카이림 꼭대기에서 오블리비언의 광기의 프린스는,허씬에게 말을걸며 손짓으로 불렀다. 이날이 자신의 날이었으므로, 사냥꾼의 신은 형체를 드러냈고 쉐오고라스가  대담함하게도 그의 흥미를 돋궜다.\n"
"\n"
"찡그린 채로, 쉐오고라스는 그가 그의 왕국이 낄낄대는 바보나 겁많은 훼손자들만 있다는 말을 참으며 정신을 잡았다. 광기의 프린스는 이익없는 거래를 하며, 불필요한 유혈 사태를 조장하여 다른 이의 이유없는 혼란이나 비극, 격노를 위해 촉발시키리라 다짐하였다. 그리하여 쉐오고라스는 허씬의 경쟁자가 되는 형국에 이르게 된 것이었다.\n"
"\n"
"천천히, 쉐오고라스는 그의 경기를,각각의 프린스는 한마리의 야수를 만들어 이 장소에서 앞으로 3년 후의 같은 시각에 다시 만나 운명의 전투를 하기로, 제안했다. 무시무시한 속내를 감춘 허씬은 표정없이 동의했다. 그리고 무가치하지만 눈보라를 뿌리는 대결을 뒤로하고 프린스들은 각자의 왕국으로 돌아갔다.\n"
"\n"
"허씬은 자신감에 차있었지만, 쉐오고라스가 사기꾼인 것을 알아 조심스럽게 자신의 숨겨진 왕국에서 증오를 키웠다. 그가 소환한 고대의 데이드로스 (Daedroth)는 더러운 저주로 가득찬 늑대인간이었다. 강한 심장과 날카로운 송곳니를 가진 형언할 수 없는 공포는 대적할 상대가 없었다. 심지어 허씬의 뛰어난 사냥꾼들조차도.\n"
"\n"
"삼년 후 추수 감사절, 허씬은 돌아왔다. 쉐오고라스는 바위 위에서 다리를 꼰채 기대 있었고, 참을성 없이 빈둥대며 휘파람을 불고 있었다. 사냥의 왕자 (허씬)는 그의 창을 바닥에 꽂고 자연법칙에 어긋나는 으르렁거리는 괴수를 그의 앞으로 데려왔다. 모자를 벗으며, 언제나처럼 교활한 쉐오고라스는 일어나 옆으로 비켜섰다. 그곳엔 아주 작은 다채로운 색깔의 새가 앉아 있었다. 얌전히 청어의 목소리처럼 작게 짹짹거리는 소리는 간신히 들릴 정도였다.\n"
"\n"
"뒤틀거리며 돌덩이 위에서 뛰어오른 데이드로스는 그가 있던 자리에 파편만을 남긴 채, 새가 있는 바위쪽으로 뛰어 올랐다. 괴물은 이겼다고 생각하면서 더러운 털복숭이 입으로 조롱하듯 이를 드러내며 웃었다. 정복자의 노래가 공기중으로 또렷이 울렸다. 작은 새는 포악한 데이드로스의 코옆으로 날아올랐다. 쉐오고라스는 조용하고 유쾌하게 작은 생물이 괴물의 비늘로 싸인 눈을 쪼는 장면을 쳐다 보았다. 격분하여 짖으면서, 눈 먼 괴물은 성가신 새를 잡아죽이러 했다. 몇시간이 지난 후에 허씬은 부끄러움에 차, 그의 훌륭한 괴수가 보이지 않는 짹짹거리는 새를 잡기 위해 애를 쓰다가 차츰 망가져 가는 모습을 보았다.\n"
"\n"
"화가 났지만 패배한 허씬은 찢어진 시체를 태우고는 이제는 존재 하지 않는 언어로 욕을 하며 그의 왕국으로 물러났다. 그의 저주는 아직 이 봉우리 ,높이는 그리 높지 않았지만, 에 남아있고 어떤 여행자도 감히 그곳에서 허씬의 분노를 부추기려 하지 않는다.\n"
"\n"
"발길을 돌리며, 쉐오고라스는 지저귀는 작은 새에 어깨에 앉으라고 손짓했다. 그리고 산을 한가로이 내려가며, 아베신 해안 (Abecean coast)의 따뜻한 산들바람과 활기찬 일몰을 만들었다. 그런 그의 어깨 위에선 탐리엘의 가장 작은 챔피언이 아름다운 곡조로 노래를 부르고 있었다."

"Sheogorath Invents Music\n"
"\n"
"In the earliest of days, in a time when the world was still raw, Sheogorath decided to walk amongst the mortals. He donned his guise of Gentleman With a Cane, and moved from place to place without being recognized. After eleven days and eleven nights, Sheogorath decided that life among mortals was even more boring than his otherworldly existence.\n"
"\n"
"\"What can I do to make their lives more interesting?\" he said to himself. At that same moment, a young woman nearby commented wistfully to herself, \"The sounds of the birds are so beautiful.\"\n"
"\n"
"Sheogorath silently agreed with her. Mortals could not make the beautiful and inspired calls of birds. Their voices were wretched and mundane. He could not change the nature of mortals, for that was the purview of other Daedric Princes. However, he could give them tools to make beautiful sounds.\n"
"\n"
"Sheogorath took hold of the petulant woman and ripped her asunder. From her tendons he made lutes. From her skull and arm bones he made a drum. From her bones he made flutes. He presented these gifts to the mortals, and thus Music was born.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Contest of Wills\n"
"\n"
"A mighty wizard named Ravate once walked the Winds of Time to find Lord Sheogorath. His intent was to win a favor from this most capricious of the Daedric Princes. Upon finding Sheogorath, Ravate spoke humbly to him, \"Lord Sheogorath, I beg a favor of you. I would gladly drive a thousand men mad in your name if you would but grant me the greater magical powers.\"\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately for Ravate, Sheogorath was in a playful mood. He proposed a game. \"I will grant your wish, if you are still sane in three days. During that time, I will do my utmost to drive you mad. It shall be great fun.\"\n"
"\n"
"Ravate was not so certain that he liked this new deal. He had been really looking forward to driving a thousand men mad. \"Lord Sheogorath, I regret having disturbed you with my shallow, selfish request. I withdraw my unfortunate plea and will humbly leave this place.\"\n"
"\n"
"Sheogorath just laughed. \"Too late, mighty Ravate. The game is afoot, and you must play.\" Ravate fled, only to find that all exits from the Daedric realm were now sealed. He wandered aimlessly, constantly looking over his shoulder, jumping at every noise. Each moment brought new terror as he waited for Sheogorath to begin.\n"
"\n"
"After three days, Ravate was convinced that every plant and animal was a tool of Sheogorath. He hadn't eaten or drunk for fear that Sheogorath had poisoned the food or drink. He hadn't slept for fear of Sheogorath invading his dreams. (Which was foolish, as dreams are the domain of Vaermina, may She grant us Restful Sleep.)\n"
"\n"
"It was then that Sheogorath appeared to him. Ravate cried out, \"You have set the whole world to watching me! Every creature and plant are doing your bidding to drive me mad.\"\n"
"\n"
"Sheogorath replied, \"Actually, I have done nothing. You have driven yourself mad with your fears. Your delusions prove that you are truly deranged, and therefore I win. While you wanted to make a thousand men mad, I only wanted to break one man's mind, yours.\"\n"
"\n"
"From that day forward Ravate served Sheogorath's every whim. Whenever daring travelers try to approach Sheogorath, Ravate warns them, \"Sheogorath is already inside each of us. You have already lost.\""

"\n"
"초창기,세상이 아직 날것의 상태였을 때, 쉐오고라스는 인간들과 살기로 했다. 그는 지팡이를 든 신사의 모습으로 변장하여,들키지 않고 세상의 이곳 저곳을 떠돌아다녔다.열 한 낮과 열 한 밤 후에,쉐오고라스는 인간들의 삶이 자신 세계의 어느 존재보다도 따분하다고 느꼈다.\n"
"\n"
"\" 어떻게 하면 저들의 인생이 더욱 재미있어질까? \"그는 자신에게 되뇌었다.그 순간, 그의 옆에 있던 젊은 여자가 자신을 가리키며 애석하게 이야기 하기를,\" 새들의 지저귐이 너무나도 아름답구나.\"\n"
"\n"
"쉐오고라스는 소리없이 동의했다. 인간들은 새들처럼 아름답고 탁월한 목소리를 낼 수 없었다. 인간들의 목소리는 흉측하고 보잘것 없었다. 인간의 본질은 다른 데이드릭 프린스들의 영역이기 때문에 그는 인간의 본질을 바꿀 수는 없었다. 허나, 인간들에게 아름다운 소리를 낼 수 있는 도구를 주는 것은 가능했다.\n"
"\n"
"쉐오고라스는 불평하는 여인을 잡고 그녀를 찢어버렸다. 그녀의 힘줄로 류트를 만들었다. 그녀의 해골과 팔 뼈로 드럼을 만들었다. 그녀의 남은 뼈로 플루트를 만들었다. 그는 인간들에게 저 선물들을 하사했고, 그리하여 음악이 탄생했다.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"의지의 시합\n"
"\n"
"라바트라는 강력한 마법사가 시간의 바람을 타고 쉐오고라스를 찾아 나섰다. 그의 의도는 데이드릭 프린스중 가장 변덕스러운 그에게 한가지 요청을 하는 것이었다. 쉐오고라스를 찾자, 그가 말하길, \"쉐오고라스님, 저의 요청을 하나만 들어주십시오. 제 마력을 더욱 강하게 해주신다면 기꺼이 당신의 이름 하에 1000명의 인간을 미쳐버리게 하겠습니다.\"\n"
"\n"
"라바트에겐 운 좋게도, 쉐오고라스는 마침 장난을 치고 싶은 상태였다. 그는 게임을 하나 제안하였다. \"만약 네가 3일 후에 제정신이라면 너의 요구를 들어주겠다. 3일 동안 나는 너를 미치게 만드는데 최선을 다 하겠다. 정말 재미있을거라고.\"\n"
"\n"
"라바트는 이 제안이 마음에 들지 않았다. 그는 사실 천명의 인간을 미치게 하는 것을 꽤나 기대하고 있엇기 때문이다. \"쉐오고라스님, 저의 속좁고 이기적인 소원으로 당신을 방해하여 황공하옵니다. 저는 제 요청을 거둬들이고 이곳을 겸손하게 떠나도록 하겠습니다.\"\n"
"\n"
"쉐오고라스는 그저 웃었다. \"너무 늦었다구, 위대한 라바트여. 게임은 이미 시작했고 너는 참가해야만 한다네.\" 라바트는 도망쳤지만, 데이드라의 세계에서 나가는 모든 탈출구가 닫혀버렸다는 것만을 알게 되었다. 그는 정처없이 돌아다녔다. 그는 계속해서 어깨 뒤로 돌아보고, 가장 작은 소음에도 소스라치게 놀랐다. 쉐오고라스가 무언가를 시작하기를 기다리는 모든 순간이 그에게 새로운 공포를 가져다주었다.\n"
"\n"
"3일 후, 라바트는 모든 동물과 식물이 쉐오고라스의 도구라고 굳게 믿게되었다.그는 쉐오고라스가 음식에 독을 탓다고 생각하여 그 어떤 것도 먹거나 마시지 않았다. 그는 쉐오고라스가 자신의 꿈을 침범할까봐 자지도 않았다. (이것은 어리석은 짓이었다.왜냐하면, 꿈은 데이드릭 프린스 바에르미나의 영역이기 때문이다. 그녀가 우리에게 평온한 잠을 내리길.)\n"
"\n"
"그때 쉐오고라스가 라바트 앞에 등장하였다. 라바트가 울먹이며 소리치길, \"당신은 이세상 전부가 나를 감시하도록 돌렸어! 모든 동물과 식물이 당신의 명령에따라 나를 미치게 만들고 있어.\"\n"
"\n"
"쉐오고라스가 답하길, \"사실, 나는 아무것도 하지 않았다. 너는 공포로 너 자신을 미치게 했을 뿐이다. 너의 망상이야 말로 네가 정말로 미쳤다는걸 증명했으니, 내가 이겼군. 너는 천명의 인간을 미치게 하고 싶었겠지만, 나는 너라는 한 사람의 마음을 부셔버리고 싶었을 뿐이란다.\"\n"
"\n"
"그날부터 라바트는 쉐오고라스의 모든 수발을 들었다. 대담한 여행자들이 쉐오고라스에게 접근하려고 하면, 라바트는 그들에게 이렇게 경고한다. \n"
"\n"

"Sheogorath and King Lyandir\n"
"\n"
"King Lyandir was known to be an exceedingly rational man. He lived in a palace that was a small, simple structure, unadorned with art and ugly to look upon. \"I do not need more than this,\" he would say. \"Why spend my gold on such luxuries when I can spend it on my armies or on great public works?\"\n"
"\n"
"His kingdom prospered under his sensible rule. However, the people did not always share the king's sense of practicality. They would build houses that were beautiful to look upon, although not necessarily very practical. They devoted time and energy to works of art. They would celebrate events with lavish festivals. In general, they were quite happy.\n"
"\n"
"King Lyandir was disappointed that more of them did not follow his example and lead frugal, sensible lives. He brooded on this for many years. Finally, he decided that his subjects simply didn't understand how much more they could accomplish if they didn't waste time on those frivolous activities. Perhaps, he reasoned, they just needed more examples.\n"
"\n"
"The king decreed that all new buildings must be simple, unadorned, and no larger than was necessary for their function. The people were not happy about this, but they liked their king and respected the new law. In a few short years, there were more plain buildings than ornate ones. The citizens used the money saved to make and buy even more lavish art and hold even more excessive celebrations.\n"
"\n"
"Once again, King Lyandir decided to provide them a strict example of how beneficial it would be to use their time and resources for more practical purposes. He banned all works of art in the city. The people were quite put out by this, but they knew that their king was doing what he thought was best for them. However, human nature is not so easily denied. In a few more years the city was filled with plain, simple buildings, and devoid of any sort of art. However, the people now had even more money and time to devote to their parties and festivals.\n"
"\n"
"With a heavy heart, King Lyandir decided that his people were to be treated like children. And like all children, they needed rules and discipline laid down by great figures of authority to make them understand what was truly important in life. He decreed that there should be no revelry in the city. Singing, dancing, and music were all banned. Even food and drink were limited to water and simple foodstuffs.\n"
"\n"
"The people had had enough. Revolt was out of the question, since King Lyandir had a very well trained and equipped army. They visited the shrines and temples in droves, praying to all the gods, and even to some of the Daedric Princes, that King Lyandir would revoke these new, oppressive laws.\n"
"\n"
"Sheogorath heard their pleas and decided to visit King Lyandir. He appeared to the king in his dreams as a field of flowers, each with arms instead of petals and the face of the Madgod in the center. \"I am Lord of the Creative and Lord of the Deranged. Since you have no use for my gifts of creativity, I have decided to bless you with an abundance of my other gift.\"\n"
"\n"
"From that day forward, every child born in the city was born into madness. Since infants do not reveal illnesses of the mind, it was several years before this was realized. The king's own son was among the victims, suffering from seizures and delusions. Yet, King Lyandir refused to change his ways.\n"
"\n"
"When his son, Glint, was 12 years old, he stabbed his father while Lyandir was sleeping. With his dying breath, King Lyandir asked, \"Why?\" His son replied, \"It is the most practical thing I could do.\"\n"
"\n"
"The new, young king ordered all the palace servants slaughtered. He ordered a grand festival to celebrate his new reign and the repeal of Lyandir's laws. He served the crowds a stew made from the carcasses of the palace servants. He ordered the east facing walls of every building painted red, and the west facing walls painted in stripes. He decreed that all citizens wear ornate masks on the backs of their heads. He then burned down the palace and began construction of a new one.\n"
"\n"
"In the new palace, the young king ordered his personal chambers to not have any doors; for fear that small woodland creatures would attack him. He ordered that it have no windows for fear that the sun and moon were jealous of him and plotting his death.\n"
"\n"
"And thus ended the line of King Lyandir. The people of the city returned to their grand works of art and raucous celebrations. They talked and acted as if they still had a living king, and even kept up the palace, using it to house and care for their mad children. Sheogorath was mightily pleased with this outcome. From that day forward the city was blessed with more than the normal number of gifted artists and deranged citizens."

"쉐오고라스와 왕 리얀디르\n"
"\n"
"왕 리얀디르는 굉장히 합리적인 사람으로 알려져 있다. 그의 궁전은 작고, 간단하며, 그 어떤 치장도 없어 흉해 보였다. 그는 \"나는 이 이상 필요하지 않다\" 라고 말했다. \"내 돈을 군대나 위대한 공공시설에 쓸수 있는데 저런 사치에 돈을 낭비할 필요가 있느냐?\"\n"
"\n"
"그의 왕국은 그의 합리적인 정치하에 융성했다. 하지만, 국민들은 언제나 왕의 합리성을 받아들이지는 못했다. 그들은 아름답지만 실용적이지는 않은 집을 지었다. 그들은 시간과 에너지를 예술 작품에 쏟았다. 그들은 성대한 잔치를 열었다. 전체적으로, 그들은 꽤 행복했다.\n"
"\n"
"리얀디르는 많은 국민들이 그를 따라서 검소하고 합리적인 삶을 살지 않는 것에 실망했다. 그는 이 문제에 대해 몇년간 고민했다. 그리고 마침내, 그는 그의 국민들이 저런 사치에 돈과 시간을 쏟지 않으면 얼마나 다른 일에서 성공할 수 있는지를 모르기 때문에 사치를 부린다는 결론에 이르게 되었다. 그는 국민들이 그저 더 많은 본보기를 필요로 하는 것일지도 모른다고 생각했다.\n"
"\n"
"왕은 새로운 건물은 모두 간단하고, 치장되지 않으며, 필요 이상으로 커서는 안된다고 공표했다. 국민들은 이에 대해 불만이었지만, 그래도 그들의 왕에 대해서 전체적으로 호감을 가지고 있었기 때문에 새로운 법령을 잘 지켰다. 몇년이 지나자, 화려한 건물보다는 수수한 건물들이 많아지게 되었다. 국민들은 이로 인해 아껴진 돈으로 더욱 화려한 예술작품을 만들고 더욱 성대한 잔치를 열었다.\n"
"\n"
"다시 한 번, 리얀디르는 더욱 합리적인 일에 시간과 자원을 쓰는 것이 얼마나 좋은지에 대해 엄격한 예시를 보여주기로 했다. 그는 도시에서 모든 예술 작품을 금지했다. 국민들은 상당한 불만을 느끼게 되었지만, 그들의 왕이 자신들을 위해 하는 일이란 것을 이해했다. 허나, 인간의 본질은 그리 쉽게 억눌러지지 않았다. 몇년 후, 도시는 수수한 건물들로 가득 찼고 어떤 예술작품도 없게 되었다. 허나, 사람들은 이제 더더욱 성대한 파티와 잔치를 벌일 돈이 생겼을 뿐이었다. 비통한 심정으로, 리얀디르는 그의 국민들을 아이들처럼 취급할 수 밖에 없다고 단정하였다. 아이들처럼 그들은 거대한 힘에 의한 규칙과 규율에 의해서만 인생에서 정말로 중요한 것이 뭔지 배울 수 있다고 생각했다. 그는 도시에서 모든 오락을 금지시켰다. 노래, 춤, 음악, 등등은 모두 금지되었다. 심지어 음식마저 물과 간단한 음식으로 제한하였다. 국민들은 참을 수 없엇다. 리얀디르의 막강한 군대 때문에 반란은 생각할 수도 없었다. 그들은 무리지어 신전과 사당에 가서 모든 신, 그리고 심지어 데이드릭 프린스들에게 리얀디르가 이 강압적인 법령들은 철폐하게 해달라고 기도했다. \n"
"\n"
"쉐오고라스는 이 기도를 듣고 리얀디르를 만나기로 했다. 그는 왕의 꿈속에서 꽃밭으로 등장했다. 모든 꽃들은 꽃잎 대신 인간의 팔이 있엇고, 가운데에는 광기의 신(쉐오고라스)의 얼굴이 있었다. \"나는 창의력의 신이자 미친 자의 신이다. 너에게는 나의 창의력의 선물이 쓸모 없는 것 같으니, 나의 다른 선물을 하사해 주도록 하지.\"\n"
"\n"
"그 날 부터, 도시에서 태어난 모든 아이는 광인으로 태어났다. 갓난아기는 광기를 보이지 않는 탓에, 몇년이 지나서야 사람들은 사태를 직감하였다. 왕의 아들 역시 피해자 중 하나여서 발작과 환상을 보았다. 하지만 리얀디르는 여전히 그의 방식을 바꾸지 않았다.\n"
"\n"
"그의 아들 글린트가 12세가 되자, 리얀디르가 잠을 자는 동안 그의 아버지를 찔렀다. 마지막 순간에 리얀디르는 \"어째서?\" 라고 물었고, 그의 아들은 \"내가 할 수 있는 가장 합리적인 일이었습니다\" 라고 대답했다.\n"
"\n"
"새로운 젊은 왕은 왕궁의 모든 하인을 학살할 것을 명했다. 그는 그의 정권과 리얀디르의 법령 철회를 축하할 성대한 파티를 열었다. 그는 하객들에게 왕궁 하인들의 시체로 만든 스튜를 베풀었다. 그는 모든 건물의 동쪽면을 빨갛게 칠하고, 서쪽면을 줄무늬로 칠할 것을 명했다. 그는 모든 국민이 뒤통수에 화려한 마스크를 쓸것을 명했다. 그리고 그는 왕궁을 불태우고 새 왕궁을 지었다.\n"
"\n"
"새 왕궁에서, 그는 작은 숲 동물들이 자신을 공격할 것을 두려워해 자신의 방에 문이 없게 짓도록 명하였다. 또한, 태양과 달이 자신을 질투해 자신을 죽이려고 계획하고 있다 생각하여 창문 또한 없게 짓도록 하였다.\n"
"\n"
"그리하여 리얀디르의 대는 끊겼다. 국민들은 그들의 거대한 예술품과 방탕한 축제들로 돌아갔다. 그들은 마치 자신들에게 아직도 살아있는 왕이 있는 것처럼 말했고, 심지어 왕궁도 그대로 유지했다. 왕궁은 그들의 미친 아이들을 돌보는 시설로 쓰였다. 쉐오고라스는 이 결과에 대해 대단히 만족했다. 그날부터 그 도시는 평균 이상의 위대한 예술가와 광인들로 축복받게 되었다.\n"

"On the Utility of Marbles and Needles\n"

"A Nord, a Chimer, and a Dwemer walked into a cornerclub. \n"
"\n"
"\"What'll it be, muthseras?\" the barkeep asked. \n"
"\n"
"\"Give me a mug of mead,\" said the Nord. \n"
"\n"
"\"I'll have a snifter of shein—the good stuff, mind you,\" said the Chimer. \n"
"\n"
"\"Kindly serve me an infusion of chal, a marble, and a leather-sewing needle,\" said the Dwemer. \n"
"\n"
"\"Haw, haw,\" guffawed the Nord. \"Shor's bones! The little milk-drinker's going to play pick-up-sticks, but he can handle only one stick!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"At least I don't swear by a god who is not only imaginary, but dead,\" said the Dwemer, as the barkeep placed his items on the counter. \n"
"\n"
"\"Hey! What?\" the Nord blustered. \"Why, I ought to…!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"He's got you there, by Azura's Star,\" said the Chimer, sipping at his shein. \"A point for you, Dwarf.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"On the other hand, at least the Nord doesn't think it's clever to worship demons from other planes,\" said the Dwemer, swirling his chal. \n"
"\n"
"\"Boethiah and Mephala! You go too far!\" cried the Chimer, drawing a triangular dagger. \n"
"\n"
"\"Yeah! Let's gut the runt!\" growled the Nord, pulling a hand-axe. \n"
"\n"
"The Dwemer knocked the marble off the counter. It landed on the floor just where the Chimer was putting down his foot for his thrust. He slipped, lurched left, and buried his dagger to the hilt in the surprised Nord's chest. Meanwhile the Dwemer gave the big needle a precise flick of the finger; it spun down and lodged in a crack between the floor-planks, point up. As the Chimer back-pedaled from the dying Nord, he lost his balance and fell headfirst to the floor, where the needle pierced one of his golden eyes all the way into his brain. It took several minutes of flailing, but eventually the Chimer was as dead as the Nord. \n"
"\n"
"The Dwemer pulled a coin-purse from the Chimer's belt and gave it to the barkeep, swallowed the Nord's mead in one prolonged chug, picked up the snifter of shein and took a sip, then nodded to the barkeep and left the cornerclub, snifter in hand. \"Off to the market,\" they heard him say. \"I must get a bone-tweezer, a guar egg, and a boot-jack.\""

"Dwarven Pride, Stronger than Bone\n"
"\n"
"My studies, and this text, have focused heavily on the fact that Dwemer archaeological sites west of Vvardenfell seem to be built at much greater depths than their counterparts near the Red Mountain. I believe there was a specific threshold to which Dwarven excavators would dig before the construction of vital structures began.\n"
"\n"
"I have referred to this threshold as the \"geocline,\" but I have found that to be redundant with the Deep Venue of a colony. Still, there is some variation in the actual depth of a Deep Venue, whereas the geocline is always the marker where I reason the city proper begins.\n"
"\n"
"Tunnels and chambers at more shallow depths, while often grand in their architectural style, appear to have served little in the way of critical civic purpose. Above the geocline, surplus stores of food, warehouse chambers that may have been used in trading with nearby surface settlements, and barracks for topside patrols are common.\n"
"\n"
"These tunnels, I have observed, can meander in a seemingly more random pattern than those planned structures beneath. I hypothesize that this may be due to the unpredictable nature of any excavation, even to a race as clever as the Dwemer. Surely unexpected deposits of stone or geological events could make the effort difficult. I think that these haphazard tunnels are often the result of the search for suitable substratum to build within.\n"
"\n"
"I have found in a small number of ruins referencing a geological anomaly or place known as \"Fal'Zhardum Din.\" This is intriguing because the term not only appears in a few tablet fragments, but also very specifically on ornate metal frames in the deepest reaches of the Alftand, Irkgnthand, and Mzinchaleft strongholds of Skyrim. I have yet to decipher the meaning of these elaborate carvings, but consider it highly strange that they occur in the deepest part of each of these ruin.\n"
"\n"
"The most reasonable translation of \"Fal'Zhardum Din\" I have managed to decipher is \"Blackest Kingdom Reaches,\" but I cannot imagine what that means.\n"

"나의 연구와 이 서적은 바데펠 (Vvardenfell) 서쪽에 있는 드웨머의 고고학적 유적지가 붉은 산의 높이보다 훨씬 더 깊은 곳에 건설되어 있다는 사실에 집중하고 있다. 중요한 구조물의 건설이 시작되기 전에 갱도를 굴착한 드워프의 도구가 파낼 수 있던 한계점이 존재했다고 믿는다.\n"

"지하도나 방은 훨씬 얉은 부분에 있고 그 건축양식 덕분에 멋드러지지만, 도시의 중요한 시설로서 이용되는 것은 많지 않았던 모양이다. 남는 식량을 파는 가게나 창고는 가까운 곳에서 물물교환에 사용되었고 또 상층순회를 위한 병사들의 막사는 지오클라인의 위쪽에 존재하는 것이 일반적이었다.\n"
"\n"
"이 지하도를 조사해 보았으나, 이 아래쪽에 계획 되어진 구조물보다 훨씬 불규칙적인 굽은 통로가 존재하는 듯 하다. 이것은 드워프와 같은 현명한 종족이라 하더라도 굴삭한 후에 발견된, 예측불가능한 자연적 요인에 의한 것일 것이다. 확실히 예측하지 못했던 암반이나 지질에 의한 재해는 도시의 건설을 곤란하게 했을테지만, 그런 우연과 싸우는 중에 건설에 적당한 장소의 탐색에 매달려 있었다고 생각된다.\n"
"\n"
"지질학적인 변칙성이나 \"Fal'Zhardum Din\"이라고 알려진 장소에 관한 폐허의 참고자료를 조금 발견했다. 이것의 흥미로운 부분은, 이것은 몇몇 태블릿 조각뿐만 아니라 알프탄드 요새, 이르쿤산드 (Irkgnthand), 스카이림 므친챠레프트 (Mzinchaleft)의 가장 깊은 곳에서 발견된 빛나는 금속판에도 등장한다는 것이다. 이 정교하게 새겨진 물건의 의미는 해독할 수 없지만, 각각 폐허의 최심부에서 발견되었다는 것은 굉장히 기묘하다고 생각된다.\n"
"\n"
"\"Fal'Zhardum Din\"에 대한 가장 합리적인 번역은 '암흑의 왕국영토 (Blackest Kingdom Reaches)'이지만, 무슨 의미인지는 상상하기 어렵다.\n"
"\n"
"내가 눈치채지 못한 규칙이 있을지도 모른다. 이 깊은 의문은 최근 수년간 나의 앞에 몇번이고 나타나 평생 드워프의 중대한 비밀을 밝혀낼 수 없는 것은 아닐까라는 두려움을 갖게 한다. 답은 가까운 곳에 있는데도 불구하고 말이다 -- 아니, 문자 그대로 발 밑에 있는 것인가."

"The limited written record supports the perception of the Deep Elves as culturally revering the pursuits of logic and science. This stands in stark contrast to the belief system of most other Mer cultures. When we imagine a society structured around such a central ideology, it seems reasonable that prolific scholars, especially in fields such as mathematics, metallurgy, or architecture, would be elevated to social status like that of clergy in a more mystically inclined culture. The idea is supported by a fragment of Dwemeris text recovered from a colony in Skyrim—Irkgnthand—which I believe to be associated with Clan Rourken. My translation is as follows:\n"
"\n"
"\"Risen by order cousin-of-privilege Cuolec of Scheziline privileged duties. Clanhome building Hoagen Kultorra tradition to Hailed World shaper\"\n"
"\n"
"\"To raise granted-cousin Cuolec of <untranslatable> privilege with duties for family-home building Hoagen Kultorra<?> tradition to father Mundus shaper\"\n"
"\n"
"Some scholars interpret this as evidence of Dwemer worship of Mundus, but I do not agree. My translation of this passage suggests that a respected Dwemer by the name of Cuolec was promoted to a civic position, probably as a tonal architect. The latter half of the fragment suggests that Cuolec's position requires him to build in a specific style.\n"
"\n"
"The term Hoagen Kultorra has thus far eluded me, but I believe it may be the name of such a style. It's possible there were several styles, differing in their construction principles and typical structures.\n"
"\n"
"One earmark of what I believe was the prevalent Dwemer style among Northern clans was a feature I call the Deep Venue. Deep Venues are often made up of one or more expansive natural caverns in which several other structures occur. Structures within the Venue may be carved from the stone itself or freely erected upon the cavern floor. The largest and most impressive Venues, such as those found in Bthardamz, may even feature roads wide enough for ten large men to walk shoulder-meets-shoulder along it.\n"
"\n"
"Arcanex are typically smaller structures. Very few have been properly studied before disruption by graverobbers or greedy adventurers, but those few undisturbed sites have contained a surprising collection of magical objects, such as soul gems, alchemical concoctions, and magical texts. Some scholars take these as evidence that the Dwemer did, in fact, dabble in the magical arts. Based on what we know of their culture, as well as the fact that most arcanex are minor structures compared to other common fixtures, I would suggest that these were centers of study and nothing more. Perhaps the Dwarves established these halls as a means to study Men and Mer, who surely seemed as alien to them as the Dwemer seem to us today.\n"
"\n"
"Great Animoculotories can be found in many Dwarven strongholds. These were the factories where the centurions and various other constructs were built. I have hoped to study these chambers for clues as to the means by which those mysterious automata are given life, but those same guardians make them especially difficult and dangerous areas to explore."

"My life's work has been dedicated to investigating the Dwemer, their dubious history, and their mysterious banishment. My goal with this text is sharing my findings and conclusions based on eighty years spent studying their unique architectural remains.\n"
"\n"
"The Migration of the Deep Elves from their ancestral Dwemereth, now Morrowind, is a generally accepted fact. Recorded history supports this, specifically mentioning the Rourken Clan's refusal to join King Dumac in the forming of the First Council and their subsequent exodus to Hammerfell. The architectural premise is also sound, as the building habits of the Dwarves adapted and changed, albeit slowly and in subtle ways, over time and land. I propose that some of these differences are stylistic as well as practical.\n"
"\n"
"Traditional viewpoints suggest that the Vvardenfell Dwemer were the most prolific of their kind. Based on my excavations throughout Skyrim, Morrowind, and High Rock, I am not sure that this is the case. While Vvardenfell is almost cluttered with Dwarven ruins poking through the surface of the landscape, the construction of those ruins is fundamentally different from the majority of what I've observed elsewhere.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, as we delve into Vvardenfell ruins, we notice that their internal structure is quite different. While major civic and operational chambers are found near the surface in a Vvardenfell Ruin, that is not typically the case on the mainland. Minor passageways and storehouse rooms are near the surface, but more important locations do not occur until we explore much deeper.\n"
"\n"
"Because such major locations are well-hidden in Dwemer Ruins outside of Morrowind, many scholars believed they were in fact not present in ruins outside that province. This premature conclusion has led some to believe such sites to be mere outposts. My research has shown this not to be the case.\n"
"\n"
"A few theories may explain this difference. Perhaps clan architects simply had their own styles and preferences when it came to civic planning. This seems only somewhat likely, as Dwarven techniques were based on empirical study, and there was likely little room for creative interpretation when it came to building technique. Geological makeup of the terrain almost certainly played a role, especially in a region like Northern Skyrim, where the ground near the surface is very rocky and often frozen, as opposed to the volcanic substratum common in Vvardenfell or the ubiquitous aquifers found in Hammerfell. It's possible that Dwarven architects in the North were not able to excavate larger structures until reaching more pliable strata.\n"
"\n"
"This scholar would like to suggest, however, that many structures west of Morrowind were built after 1E 420. When the Clan Rourken left Vvardenfell, it seems evident that several clans broke off to create their own settlements, choosing to live in greater isolation than their Eastern brethren. This theory is particularly fascinating, because it leads me to believe that Dwarven architects may have developed even more elaborate methods of hiding their strongholds over time.\n"
"\n"
"This opens the distinct possibility that undisturbed Dwarven archaeological sites exist throughout Tamriel, even in southern areas like Cyrodiil or Black Marsh, where Dwarves are not believed to have ever had a significant presence. Though we should not get carried away on flights of fancy, one could extrapolate this logic to suggest that some Dwarven clans were living among us for much longer than previously believed, perhaps well beyond the disappearance during the War of the Red Mountain in 1E 700."

"나는 드웨머들의 모호한 역사와 신비로운 소멸에 대해 밝혀내는 것을 필생의 과업으로 삼아왔다. 이 글을 통해 나는, 지난 80년을 그들이 남긴 독특한 건축물들을 연구하는 데 투자하면서 내가 찾아낸 결과물과 결론들을 공유하고자 한다.\n"
"\n"
"드워프들의 선조가 존재하던 땅에서 이주해 온 것은 지금의 모로윈드에서는 널리 알려진 사실이다. 기록된 역사가 이를 증명하며, 특히 듀막 (Dumac) 왕이 첫 의회를 구성했을 때 로어켄 (Rourken) 부족이 그것에 참여하기를 거부했고, 그 뒤 그들의 후예가 해머펠로 탈출했다는 점이 이를 뒷받침한다. 건축학적 전제 역시 마찬가지인데, 세월이 지남에 따라 드워프의 건축 양식이 천천히, 미묘하게 수용되고 변모되었다. 나는 이러한 건축물들의 몇몇 차이점이 형식 뿐만 아니라 실용적인 면도 있음을 제시하는 바이다.\n"
"\n"
"전통적인 관점에서는 드웨머들 중 바덴펠 (Vvardenfell) 드웨머들이 가장 다수를 차지하고 있었던 것으로 추정하고 있다. 그러나 내가 스카이림, 모로윈드, 하이락을 발굴해 본 바에 따르면, 이것이 정확한 것인지는 의문스럽다. 바덴펠이 가장 많이 지표 위에 퍼져있는 드웨머 유적이긴 하나, 그 유적들의 건축 구조는 내가 다른 곳에서 발견한 대다수의 것들과 근본적인 차이점이 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"게다가, 바덴펠 유적들을 발굴해보면 그것들의 내부 구조 역시 상당히 다르다는 점을 알아차릴 수 있다. 주요한 시민 시설이나 집행 시설이 바덴펠 유적의 지표 가까이에 있지만, 그것은 본토의 전형적인 형태가 아니다. 본토에서는 소규모의 통로나 창고같은 것들이 지표의 가까이에 있긴 하나, 더 중요한 장소는 훨씬 깊숙한 곳까지 탐색하지 않으면 나타나지 않았다.\n"
"\n"
"이러한 중요한 장소들이 모로윈드 밖의 드웨머 유적에서는 잘 숨겨져 있었기 때문에, 많은 학자들은 그 지방 외에는 유적이 존재하지 않는다고 믿었다. 이 성급한 결론 덕택에 저러한 장소 - 즉 중요 장소가 잘 숨겨진 - 들은 단순히 전초기지 정도로 여겨져 왔다. 허나 나의 연구는 그것이 아님을 증명한다.\n"
"\n"
"이러한 차이점을 설명하기 위해서는 몇가지 가설을 세워볼 수 있다. 아마도 각 부족의 건축가들이 도시계획을 할 때, 단순히 그들 나름대로의 양식과 선호도에 따라 배치했을 수도 있다. 이것은 드워프의 기술이 대체로 경험적 지식에 의해 얻어지는 것이기 때문에 건축 기술면에서 별로 창의성을 발휘할 여지가 없었다는 점에서 약간의 가능성이 존재한다. 토양의 지질학적 문제도 하나의 요인이 될 수 있을 것이다. 특히 스카이림 북방지역 같은 경우는 지표 가까운 곳의 땅이 대부분 바위 투성이인데다 얼어붙어 있지만, 이에 비해 바덴펠이나 해머펠쪽에 있는 토양은 대부분 화산 기층이다. 따라서 북방의 드워프 기술자들은 더 부드러운 지층을 찾아내기 전 까지는 대규모 건축물을 만들 수 없었을 것이라는 가능성도 있다.\n"
"\n"
"그러나 필자는 1시대 420년 이후 모로윈드 서쪽에 지어진 많은 건축물들에 대해 논하고자 한다. 로어켄 부족이 바덴펠을 떠났을 때, 몇몇 부족들 역시 자신들의 정착지를 만들기 위해 떠났고, 동쪽의 동포들보다 더 고립된 곳에서 사는 것을 선택했다는 것은 분명해 보인다. 이 가설은 특히 매력적인데, 이것이 나로 하여금 드워프 건축가들이 시간이 지날수록 그들의 요새를 숨기기 위해 더 정교한 방법을 발전시켜 왔음을 시사해 주기 때문이다.\n"
"\n"
"이것은 탐리엘 전역에서 드워프의 고고학적 장소들이 존재할 가능성 - 심지어는 드워프들이 특별히 존재하지 않았으리라 여겨지던 시로딜이나 블랙 마쉬같은 남방 지역에도 존재할 수 있다는 가능성을 제시한다. 공상에 지나치게 빠져서는 안되겠지만, 이것을 통해 우리가 드워프들이 사라졌다고 생각하는 시점, 즉 1시대 700년 붉은 산에서의 전쟁 중 드워프들이 실종되었다고 생각한 그 시점 이후에도 몇몇 드워프 부족들이 우리들 사이에서 살고 있었을 가능성이 있다는 것을 추론해 낼 수 있다."

"The Snow Elf and the Variation-Lens\n"
"\n"
"By Marobar Sul\n"
"\n"
"Mzulchond the Tonal Architect had spent twenty years attuning the great animus geode he'd found in Inner Duathand, trying to synchronize it with the precession of the dual equinoxes in order to captivate the Nirnpith Essence. The geode's vibratory affinities continued to elude him, however, so one day he threw down his attenuators, left his workshop, and went to the kitchens for an infusion of chal. \n"
"\n"
"As he approached the kitchen portal he heard sibilant music that cut off abruptly as he stepped over the threshold. His house-assistant, a Snow Elf maiden named Lilyarel, withdrew her hands from behind the steam-grill and looked up guiltily. \n"
"\n"
"\"I heard music, Lilyarel,\" Mzulchond said. \"What did you just put behind the calorefactor?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"It's nothing, Sir Dwarf,\" the maiden replied. \"Just something I cobbled together to pass the time.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"What? Have you been in my device-closet again? Show me what you have there.\"\n"
"\n"
"Reluctantly, the Snow Elf reached behind the steam-grill and drew out a fist-sized object of golden metal, crystal knobs glinting on its flange-hood. Mzulchond held out his hand, open, and Lilyarel carefully placed the object in it. \"Don't drop it,\" she said. \"It'll get de-tuned.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Well, well,\" the engineer said. \"So you've built yourself a crude tonal variation-lens. Is this what was playing the music I heard?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Yes, Sir Dwarf,\" the maiden said, gazing at the floor. \"I hope I didn't do anything wrong.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"What, with this device? There's nothing dangerous in a melodic repeater bauble, so long as it doesn't leak bthun-waves from its volumizer. Can't have that—might interfere with the static condensers.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Oh, don't worry, I used arkoid shielding—not very much!\" she said anxiously. \"But it's not a melodic repeater, Sir, it harmonizes with my mental melodies.\" \n"
"\n"
"\"Nonsense,\" Mzulchond scoffed. \"No one knows how to synchronize a variation-lens with mental concept-cycles. It's never been done.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I wouldn't know anything about that, Sir Dwarf,\" Lilyarel said, wringing her hands nervously. \"I just flipped the duum-emitter so it canceled the demi-ektar-waves, and it worked just fine. Can I have it back now?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Hold on a dzum,\" the engineer said, raising a hand while he looked more closely at the gleaming device. \"Flipping the duum-emitter cancels the demi-ektars? Yes … yes, I can see how that might work. This may be just the thing I need to attune my animus geode to the Nirnpith Essence!\"\n"
"\n"
"As Mzulchond turned in excitement to take the variation-lens back to his workshop, the Elf maiden picked up a flipper-strut with both hands and struck him across the back of the head. The tonal architect fell dead to the ground, as Lilyarel picked up her shiny device. \"Never liked him,\" she hissed to herself. \"Always smelled like Dwemer oil.\"\n"
"\n"
"Then she opened the brazen louvers of a vent-tube, crawled in, and began lowering herself down through the inwards of the Dwarven city. \"Guess I'm going down to join the Undermer, and not coming back.\" And with that, she turned on her variation-lens, which immediately began harmonizing with her mental melodies."

"\"전 그것에 대해 아무것도 알 수 없을 거예요, 드워프 님.\" 릴리아렐이 초조하게 손을 저으며 말했다. \"저는 그저 듐-이미터를 뒤집어서 데미-엑타르 파동을 멈추게 했더니 잘 작동했습니다. 이제 돌려받을 수 있을까요?\"\n"

"The Ransom of Zarek, Part 2\n"
"\n"
"\"Now thou wert just showing off,\" frowned Jalemmil. \"Surely that would have been a good time to escape.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Thou might think so,\" agreed Zarek. \"But thou had to see the topography—a few large trees, and then nothing but shrubs. Ulin would have noticed my absence and caught up with me in no time, and I would have had a hard time explaining Mathais's absence. However, the brief forage around the area allowed me to observe some of the trees close up, and I could formulate my final plan.\n"
"\n"
"\"When I got back to camp with a few twigs, I told Ulin that Mathais was slow coming along, dragging a large dead tree behind him. Ulin scoffed at his brother's strength, saying it would take him time to pull up a live tree by the roots and drop it on the bonfire. I expressed reasonable doubt.\n"
"\n"
"\"'I'll show thee,' he said, ripping up a ten-foot-tall specimen effortlessly.\n"
"\n"
"\"'But that's scarcely a sapling,' I objected. 'I thought thou couldst rip up a tree.' His eyes followed mine to a magnificent, heavy-looking one at the edge of the clearing. Ulin grabbed it and began to shake it with a tremendous force to loosen its roots from the dirt. With that, he loosened the hive from the uppermost branches, dropping it down onto his head.\n"
"\n"
"\"That was when I made my escape, mother,\" said Zarek in conclusion, showing a little schoolboy pride. \"While Mathais and Koorg were at the base of the cliff, and Ulin was flailing about, engulfed by a swarm.\"\n"
"\n"
"Jalemmil embraced her son once again.\n"

"Publisher's Note:\n"
"\n"
"I was reluctant to publish Marobar Sul's \"Ancient Scrolls of the Dwemer,\" but when the University of Gwylim Press asked me to edit this edition, I decided to use this as an opportunity to set the record straight once and for all.\n"
"\n"
"Scholars do not agree on the exact date of Marobar Sul's work, but it is generally agreed that they were written by the playwright \"Gor Felim,\" famous for popular comedies and romances during the Second Era after the fall of the Reman Empire. The current theory holds that Felim heard a few genuine Dwemer tales and adapted them to the stage in order to make money, along with rewritten versions of many of his own plays.\n"
"\n"
"Gor Felim created the persona of \"Marobar Sul\" who could translate the Dwemer language in order to add some sort of validity to the work and make it even more valuable to the gullible. Note that while \"Marobar Sul\" and his works became the subject of heated controversy, there are no reliable records of anyone actually meeting \"Marobar Sul,\" nor was there anyone of that name employed by the Mages Guild, the School of Julianos, or any other intellectual institution.\n"
"\n"
"In any case, the Dwemer in most of the tales of \"Marobar Sul\" bear little resemblance to the fearsome, unfathomable race that frightened even the Dunmer, Nords, and Redguards into submission and built ruins that even now have yet to be understood."

"\n"
"The Dwarves have been extinct for many an age, and perhaps that's for the best. To see men and women the size of large children, all with beards, would be a most disturbing sight. Still, whatever wrath the Dwarves brought from the gods that consumed an entire civilization surely must have been an awe-inspiring thing to witness.\n"
"\n"
"The remnants of their civilization lie buried in the hearts of mountains. Scholars and thieves the world over descend on the skeletal remains of Dwarven cities like vultures to scrape clean the bones of the past, old knowledge waiting to be exhumed, and treasures to be discovered. But many men lie murdered in those halls of the damned, because those Dwarven ruins do not release their treasures without a fight.\n"
"\n"
"My kin would tell stories long ago, when I was just a child, about how adept the Dwarves were at building machines. They would say that before our time, Dwarves harnessed the power of the earth. They wielded fire and hammers to reshape steel and bronze with a mechanical brilliance that breathed life into these now ancient constructs of metal and magic. In their dark halls and chambers, amid the ceaseless droning of grinding gears and venting steam, they lie in wait to confound or destroy would-be plunderers of the Dwarven sanctums, as the grim watchmen of the last vestiges of culture from a dead race.\n"
"\n"
"I descended into the humid darkness of Mzulft. The slow hiss of steam, creaking of metal, and rattle of old gears powering an empty city would unnerve most men. I could hear things in the darkness, skittering across the floor just out of sight as I stepped over the bodies of plunderers or scholars who had not made it far. I knew it was not rats wandering these halls.\n"
"\n"
"Small mechanical spiders set upon me with rapid movements. Machines sprouted from the walls and uncurled from spheres into contraptions that rolled on top of gears for legs and crossbows for arms. I could not help but marvel at these single purpose machines built for the murder of men. My sword and my shield are my strength, and I am undeterred by such things. I had heard of greater things roaming these depths, and indeed, something else in these chambers stirred, and it echoed with massive weight. As it lumbered closer, its feet struck the ground as if walking on massive pistons. As it loomed out of darkness, I could see it clear for the first time, axe for one hand, hammer for the other, as tall as five men, made of dull bronze with a face molded in the image of its masters. A Steam Centurion. The stories were true. These were the guardians of the greatest Dwarven treasures. \n"
"\n"
"We fought, and the Dwarves must truly be extinct, because our battle was surely booming enough to wake the dead. It came at me with hammer and axe, inhuman strength, great fortitude, and a purpose of nothing but murder. I dodged as it crushed the stone around me with futile strikes. I thrust and slashed at it with my blade and took every opening afforded as we shook the halls with violence. I refuse to be undone by a machine.\n"
"\n"
"Where the average man would be long dead, I stood over the husk of this dead automaton, its steam escaping like a final gasp. I could have taken the Dwarven artifacts and metal, but I left them there for others, for I would not hex my journey with the possessions of dead men. Maybe that is where countless others go wrong.\n"
"\n"
"I will continue on my journey across the lands. Perhaps one day Herebane will meet a worthy challenge, for I have yet to see what would make me tremble."

"\n"
"드워프 문명은 산중에 묻혀있는 채 남아있다. 전 세계의 학자들과 도굴꾼들은 마치 청소부 독수리마냥, 앙상하게 남은 드워프 도시의 유적을 찾아 뼈만 남을 때까지 잠들어 있는 고대 지식과 유물을 모으는데에 열을 올리고 있다. 하지만 그들 중 많은 이들이 저주받은 드워프의 전당에서 살해되었는데, 드웨머 유적의 보물은 싸우지 않고 얻을 수 있을만한게 아니기 때문이다.\n"
"\n"
"오래 전 내가 어렸을 때 우리 혈족들은 드워프들이 기계를 만드는 데에 얼마나 노련했는지에 대한 이야기를 들려주고는 했다. 우리네 시대 이전에 드워프들은 땅의 힘을 다룰 줄 알았고 불과 망치를 휘둘러 그들이 가진 기계에 대한 천부적인 재능을 통해 강철과 청동의 형태를 바꿔 현재 남은 고대 드워프 건축물을 이루는 마법과 금속을 만들어냈다. 그것들은 사멸해버린 한 종족이 보유한 문화를 수호하는 잔혹한 파수꾼으로서, 끝없이 돌아가는 톱니의 소음과 증기의 배출음에 둘러쌓인 어두운 전당 안에서 장차 찾아올 도굴꾼들을 궁지에 몰아넣거나 박살내길 기다리며 존속하고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 어둡고 축축한 므줄프트 안으로 내려갔다. 증기가 서서히 내뿜어져 나오는 소리, 금속이 갈라지는 소리, 텅 빈 도시에 동력을 공급하는 오래된 톱니가 달그락거리는 소리에 공포를 느끼지 않을 이는 거의 없을 것이다. 심연 속에서 무슨 소리가 들렸고, 목표를 채 이루지 못하고 그자리에서 죽은 도굴꾼 내지 학자들의 시체를 넘어서는 그 순간, 어떤 무언가가 이 전당을 가로질러 내 시야에서 벗어났는데 이 전당을 들쑤시고 다니는 들쥐는 분명 아니었다.\n"
"\n"
"자그마한 기계 거미들이 재빠르기 움직여 내 위쪽에 나타났고 벽에서는 기계가 튀어나와 톱니 위에서 구르던 구체들이 다리를 가지고 석궁으로 무장한 기묘한 장치로 전환했다. 오로지 살인을 위해 고안된 이 기계들에 감탄을 금할 길이 없었다. 나는 내 검과 방패에 의지했고 그런 기계들에게 절대 굴하지 않았는데 그 이유는 그보다 더 대단한 것이 이 지하에 돌아다니는 소리를 들었고, 분명 무언가가 이 방안에 있어 그것의 육중한 무게에서 들을 수 있는 울림을 들었기 때문이다. 그것은 점점 더 가까이 다가오면서 거대한 증기장치로 작동하는 것처럼 땅을 내리치면서 걸었으며 어둠 밖으로 서서히 모습을 드러내자 처음으로 그 실체를 명백히 볼 수 있었는데, 한 손엔 도끼, 다른 손엔 망치를 들고 있었으며 사람 다섯 명 분의 키에 자신의 제작자를 본 따 만든 얼굴을 가졌고 무딘 청동으로 만들어진 존재였다. 증기 백부장이었던 것이다. 그 이야기가 사실이었다. 이들은 고대 드워프 유물의 수호자였던 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"그놈과 싸우면서 냈던 소리는 죽은 이도 깨울만큼 요란했던 점을 생각하면 확실히 드워프가 사라졌다는 것이 명백했다. 그것은 도끼와 망치를 들고 초인적인 힘과 어마어마한 방어력을 과시하며 오로지 날 죽이겠다는 목적만으로 내 쪽으로 다가왔다. 나는 놈의 공격을 피했고 놈의 실패한 공격때문에 주변 돌바닥이 박살났으며 그 틈을 타 내 칼로 놈을 찌르고 베었으며, 찾아낼 수 있는 틈에 모조리 찔러댔는데 우리가 격렬히 싸우는 탓에 전당이 요동칠 정도였다. 난 기계따위에 죽는건 질색이다.\n"
"\n"
"보통 사람이라면 이미 죽고도 남았겠지만 나는 죽은 자동기계의 잔해 위에 올라섰고, 녀석의 몸에선 증기가 단말마처럼 뿜어져 나왔다. 나는 드워프족의 유물과 금속을 가져갈 수도 있었지만 다른 이들을 위해 그냥 두기로 했는데, 망자들의 소유물 때문에 내 여정에 마가 끼이는건 싫었고 어쩌면 그 때문에 다른 이들이 수 없이 죽어나갔을지도 모르기 때문이었다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 대륙을 가로질러 여정을 이어나갈 참이다. 아직까진 내가 전율할만한 것을 보진 못했지만 언젠가는 나에게 걸맞는 도전과 마주칠 것이다."

"(This book is a historical account of the development of Dwemer law and custom from its roots in High Elven culture.)\n"
"\n"
"In short, so far as I am able to trace the order of development in the customs of the Bosmeri tribes, I believe it to have been in all ways comparable to the growth of Altmeri law. The earlier liability for slaves and animals was mainly confined to surrender. As in the Sumerset Isles, this later became compensation.\n"
"\n"
"What does this matter for a study of our laws today? So far as concerns the influence of the Altmeri law upon our own, especially the Altmeri law of master and servant, the evidence of this is to be found in every judgment which has been recorded for the last five hundred years. It has been stated already that we still repeat the reasoning of the Altmeri magistrates, empty as it is, to the present day. I will quickly show how Altmeri custom can be followed into the courts of the Dwemer.\n"
"\n"
"In the laws of Karndar Watch (P.D. 1180) it is said, \"If one who is owned by another slays one who owns himself, the first owner must pay the associates of the slain three fine instruments and the body of the one who his owned.\" There are many other similar citations. The same principle is extended even to the case of a centurion by which a man is killed. \"If at the common workbench, one is slain by an Animunculi, the associates of the slain may disassemble the Animunculi and take its parts within thirty days.\"\n"
"\n"
"Consider what Dhark has mentioned concerning the rude beasts of the Tenmar forests. \"If a marsh cat was killed by an Argonian, his family were in disgrace till they retaliated by killing the Argonian or another like it. Furthermore, if a marsh cat was killed by a fall from a tree, his relatives would take their revenge by toppling the tree, shattering its branches, and casting them to every part of the forest.\""

" 나는 보스메리부족의 관습이 발전해 나가는 과정을 조사할 수 있었는데, 모든 점에서 알트메리법의 성장과 비교될 수 있으리라 생각된다. 초기에, 노예나 동물에 부과된 법적 책무는 주로 서머셋 섬에서의 감금이었지만, 후에 배상 제도로 바뀌어 갔다.\n"
"\n"
"이것이 왜 현재의 법규에 관한 연구에 있어서 중요한가? 알트메리의 규칙, 특히 알트메리의 주종 관계에 관한 법규가 우리들의 법규에 준 영향에 관해서 말하면, 그 영향을 나타내는 증거는 과거 500년에 걸쳐 기록된 어느 판결문에서도 볼 수 있다. 이미 기술되어 있지만, 우리들은 이 알트메리 판사의 판결을, 공허하기는 하지만 현재에 이르기까지 반복하고 있다. 그리고 나는 알트메리의 관습을 어떻게 드웨머의 법정에 도입할까를 보여줄 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"칸다르 감시탑의 규칙(P.D. 1180)에서는 '누군가에게 소유되고 있는 입장의 사람이 소유하는 측의 인간을 살해했을 때, 그 살해한 사람의 소유자는 합의자에게 무엇인가 훌륭한 것을 3개, 그리고 소유하고 있는 것의 신체를 보내야 한다.\" 그 외에 많은 문헌에도 같은 사례가 소개되고 있다. 또, 같은 원리가 백부장에 의한 살인 사건에서도 적용되고 있다. '일반적인 원칙에 의거하여, 만약에 어떤 사람이 자동장치에 의해서 살해되면, 살해된 사람의 동료는 그 자동장치의 사지를 갈기갈기 찢고, 30일 이내라면 그 뿔뿔이 흩어진 부위를 가지고 있어도 좋다'라고 되어 있다.\n"
"\n"
"다하크와 텐마 숲에 있는 야비한 야수에 관한 일을 비교해보는 것도 유익하다. '늪지 고양이가 아르고니안에게 살해당하면, 그의 가족은 아르고니안을 살해해 보복하든지, 또는 비슷한 일을 하지 않는 한 불명예스러운 것이다. 그 밖에도 늪지 고양이가 나무로부터 떨어져 죽으면, 그 친척은 나무가지를 베어 쓰러트리고 가지를 잡아 채, 숲의 여기저기에 그것을 뿌려 복수한다'라고 언급되어 있다."

"Azura and the Box\n"
"\n"
"By Marobar Sul\n"
"\n"
"Nchylbar had enjoyed an adventurous youth, but had grown to be a very wise, very old Dwemer who spent his life searching for truth and dispelling superstitions. He invented much and created many theorems and logic structures that bore his name. But much of the world still puzzled him, and nothing was a greater enigma to him than the nature of the Aedra and Daedra. Over the course of his research, he came to the conclusion that many of the gods were entirely fabricated by man and mer.\n"
"\n"
"Nothing, however, was a greater question to Nchylbar than the limits of divine power. Were the Greater Beings the masters of the entire world, or did the humbler creatures have the strength to forge their own destinies? As Nchylbar found himself nearing the end of his life, he felt he must understand this last basic truth.\n"
"\n"
"Among the sage's acquaintances was a holy Chimer priest named Athynic. When the priest was visiting Bthalag-Zturamz, Nchylbar told him what he intended to do to find the nature of divine power. Athynic was terrified, and pleaded with his friend not to break this great mystery, but Nchylbar was resolute. Finally, the priest agreed to assist out of love for his friend, though he feared the results of this blasphemy.\n"
"\n"
"Athynic summoned Azura. After the usual rituals by which the priest declared his faith in her powers and Azura agreed to do no harm to him, Nchylbar and a dozen of his students entered the summoning chamber, carrying with them a large box.\n"
"\n"
"\"As we see you in our land, Azura, you are the Goddess of the Dusk and Dawn and all the mysteries therein,\" said Nchylbar, trying to appear as kindly and obsequious as he could be. \"It is said that your knowledge is absolute.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"So it is,\" smiled the Daedra.\n"
"\n"
"\"You would know, for example, what is in this wooden box,\" said Nchylbar.\n"
"\n"
"Azura turned to Athynic, her brow furrowed. The priest was quick to explain, \"Goddess, this Dwemer is a very wise and respected man. Believe me, please, the intention is not to mock your greatness, but to demonstrate it to this scientist and to the rest of his skeptical race. I have tried to explain your power to him, but his philosophy is such that he must see it demonstrated.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"If I am to demonstrate my might in a way to bring the Dwemer race to understanding, it might have been a more impressive feat you would have me do,\" growled Azura, who turned to look Nchylbar in the eyes. \"There is a red-petaled flower in the box.\"\n"
"\n"
"Nchylbar did not smile or frown. He simply opened the box and revealed to all that it was empty.\n"
"\n"
"When the students turned to look to Azura, she was gone. Only Athynic had seen the Goddess' expression before she vanished, and he could not speak, for he was trembling so. A curse had fallen, he knew that truly, but even crueler was the knowledge of divine power that had been demonstrated. Nchylbar also looked pale, uncertain on his feet, but his face shone with not fear, but bliss: the smile of a Dwemer finding evidence for a truth only suspected.\n"
"\n"
"Two of his students supported him, and two more supported the priest as they left the chamber.\n"
"\n"
"\"I have studied much over the years, performed countless experiments, taught myself a thousand languages, and yet the skill that has taught me the final truth is one that I learned when I was but a poor, young man, struggling to earn enough gold so I could eat,\" whispered the sage.\n"
"\n"
"As he was escorted up the stairs to his bed, a red flower petal fell from the sleeve of his voluminous robe. Nchylbar died that night, a portrait of peace that comes from contented knowledge."

" 닐바 (Nchylbar)는 젊은 시절에 모험을 즐겼고, 성장하면서 더욱 영리해졌으며 진리의 탐구나 속설을 푸는데에 생애를 바치는 드웨머가 되었다. 그는 여러가지 법칙과 논리적 구조를 밝혀 그 이름을 세상에 떨칠 수 있었다. 그러나 그에게 있어서 세계의 상당수는 아직도 더욱 이상한 것으로 가득 차 있었고, 특히 에이드라와 데이드라의 본질은 수수께끼 그 자체였다. 탐구의 결과, 신들의 상당수는 인류에 의해 만들어진 것이라는 결론에 이르렀다.\n"
"\n"
"그렇지만, 닐바에게 있어서 신이 가진 힘의 한계에 대한 의문보다 더 큰 의문은 없었다. 위대한 존재가 이 세상 전체의 지배자인 것일까? 혹은 겸허한 생물들이 자신의 운명을 여는 힘을 가지고 있는 것일까? 닐바는 자신의 죽음이 가까웠음을 인지하여, 지금 의문에 도전하지 않으면 안 된다고 느꼈다.\n"
"\n"
"그의 지인으로 아시닉 (Athynic)이라는 사제가 있었다. 이 사제가 베타라그-즈람을 방문했을 때, 닐바는 그에게 자신이 신의 힘에 대한 본질의 탐구에 도전할 생각이라고 이야기했다. 아시닉은 두려워하며 떨어, 그러한 수수께끼에 손을 대지 말라고 설득했다. 그러나 닐바의 결심은 확고했다. 성직자는 이러한 신성모독의 결과를 두려워했지만, 그의 친구에 대한 사랑때문에 결국 돕기로 하였다.\n"
"\n"
"아시닉은 아주라를 소환했다. 사제가 그녀에 대한 자신의 신앙을 선언하는 평소의 의식과 아주라가 그에게 해를 끼치지 않겠다는 약속 후에, 닐바와 그의 제자 몇명이 거대한 상자를 가지고 소환실로 들어왔다.\n"
"\n"
"\"이 땅에 있는 아주라여, 당신은 황혼과 새벽의 신이며, 신비의 지배자입니다.\" 닐바는 그가 할 수 있는 최대한 온순함과 순종적인 면을 드러내며 말했다. \"그것은 당신의 지식이 절대적이라는 말이지요.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"그러하다\"라고 데이드라는 미소지었다.\n"
"\n"
"\"예를 들어, 이 상자안에는 무엇이 들어가 있는지 아시는군요.\"라고 닐바는 말했다.\n"
"\n"
"아주라는 아시닉을 향해 험한 얼굴로 돌아보았다. 사제는 서둘러, \"신이여. 이 드웨머는 매우 영리하고, 존경받은 인물입니다. 저를 믿어 주십시요. 이것은 당신의 능력을 시험하기 위해서가 아닙니다. 이 과학자와 그의 의심많은 종족에게 당신의 위대함을 보여주기 위함입니다. 저는 당신의 힘을 그에게 설명하려고 했지만, 자신이 그것을 확인해야만 하는 것이 그의 철학입니다.\"라고 해명했다.\n"
"\n"
"\"나의 힘을 한가지 보여주는 것으로 드웨머 종족이 이해할 수 있게 된다면, 나에게 하게 한 것보다 더 놀라운 위업일 것이다.\"라고 아주라는 고함치며, 닐바의 눈을 보았다.\n"
"\n"
"\"상자안에는 붉은 꽃이 1개 들어가 있다.\"\n"
"\n"
"닐바는 웃거나 인상을 찌푸리지 않았다. 그는 단지 상자를 열어서 그 안이 비어있다는 것을 모두에게 보였다.\n"
"\n"
"제자들은 일제히 아주라를 보았다. 그녀는 자취을 감추고 없었다. 오직 아시닉만이 그녀가 사라지기 전에 \"신이 한 일\"을 보았다. 그는 아무것도 말하지 못하고, 단지 떨고 있었다. 그는 자신이 방금전 증명된 신의 힘에 의해 저주가 걸렸음을 확신했다. 닐바는 창백해져 있었고 발밑도 불안했지만, 그의 얼굴은 우려가 아닌 기쁨으로 빛나고 있었다. 의문에 지나지 않았던 진실의 증거를 찾아냈다는 의미의 웃는 얼굴이다.\n"
"\n"
"제자의 2명은 그를 지탱하고 다른 2명은 사제를 지탱하여 소환실을 빠져나갔다.\n"
"\n"
"\"나는 수년동안 매우 많은 것을 배워왔고, 셀 수 없는 실험을 하고, 수천의 언어를 배웠지만, 진실을 최종적으로 가르쳐준 것은 내가 가난한 젊은이였을 때, 끼니를 위한 돈을 얻기 위해 배운 기술이었다.\" 라고 닐바는 말했다.\n"
"\n"
"그의 침대로 가는 계단으로 부축되는 도중, 한 붉은 꽃잎이 그의 폭이 넓은 로브의 소매에서 떨어져내렸다. 닐바는 그날 밤 죽었고, 충만된 지식에서 나온 평화로운 모습이었다고 묘사된다."

"Akavir is the kingdom of the beasts. No Men or Mer live in Akavir, though Men once did. These Men, however, were eaten long ago by the vampiric Serpent Folk of Tsaesci. Had they not been eaten, these Men would have eventually migrated to Tamriel. The Nords left Atmora for Tamriel. Before them, the Elves had abandoned Aldmeris for Tamriel. The Redguards destroyed Yokuda so they could make their journey. All Men and Mer know Tamriel is the nexus of creation, where the Last War will happen, where the Gods unmade Lorkhan and left their Adamantine Tower of secrets. Who knows what the Akaviri think of Tamriel, but ask yourself: why have they tried to invade it three times or more?\n"
" \n"
"There are four major nations of Akavir: Kamal, Tsaesci, Tang Mo, and Ka Po' Tun. When they are not busy trying to invade Tamriel, they are fighting with each other.\n"
" \n"
"Kamal is \"Snow Hell.\" Demons live there, armies of them. Every summer they thaw out and invade Tang Mo, but the brave monkey-folk always drive them away. Once Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal, a king among demons, attempted to conquer Morrowind, but Almalexia and the Underking destroyed him at Red Mountain.\n"
" \n"
"Tsaesci is \"Snake Palace,\" once the strongest power in Akavir (before the Tiger-Dragon came). The serpent-folk ate all the Men of Akavir a long time ago, but still kind of look like them. They are tall, beautiful (if frightening), covered in golden scales, and immortal. They enslave the Goblins of the surrounding isles, who provide labor and fresh blood. The holdings of Tsaesci are widespread. When natives of Tamriel think of the Akaviri they think of the Serpent-Folk, because one ruled the Cyrodilic Empire for four hundred years. He was Potentate Versidue-Shaie, assassinated by the Morag Tong.\n"
" \n"
"Tang Mo is the \"Thousand Monkey Isles.\" There are many breeds of monkey-folk, and they are all kind, brave, and simple (and many are also very crazy). They can raise armies when they must, for all of the other Akaviri nations have, at one time or another, tried to enslave them. They cannot decide who they hate more, the Snakes or the Demons, but ask one, and he will probably say, \"Snakes.\" Though once bitter enemies, the monkey-folk are now allies with the tiger-folk of Ka Po' Tun.\n"
" \n"
"Ka Po' Tun is the \"Tiger-Dragon's Empire\". The cat-folk here are ruled by the divine Tosh Raka, the Tiger-Dragon. They are now a very great empire, stronger than Tsaesci (though not at sea). After the Serpent-Folk ate all the Men, they tried to eat all the Dragons. They managed to enslave the Red Dragons, but the black ones had fled to (then) Po Tun. A great war was raged, which left both the cats and the snakes weak, and the Dragons all dead. Since that time the cat-folk have tried to become the Dragons. Tosh Raka is the first to succeed. He is the largest Dragon in the world, orange and black, and he has very many new ideas.\n"
" \n"
"\"First,\" Tosh Raka says, \"is that we kill all the vampire snakes.\" Then the Tiger-Dragon Emperor wants to invade Tamriel."

"아카비르 (Akavir)는 \"드래곤의 땅\"을 의미한다. 탐리엘은 \"새벽의 아름다움\"을 뜻한다. 아트모라 (Atmora)는 \"엘더 우드\"를 의미한다. 요쿠다 (Yokuda)는 오직 레드가드들만이 그 의미를 알고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"아카비르는 야수들의 왕국이다. 한 때 인간들이 살았지만, 지금 아카비르에는 인간도 엘프도 살지 않는다. 인간들은 오래전에 츠아에스치 (Tsaesci)의 흡혈귀 뱀 종족에게 잡아 먹혔다. 설사 잡아먹히지 않았더라도, 인간들은 탐리엘로 결국 이주했을 것이다. 노드들은 아트모라를 떠나 탐리엘로 갔다. 노드보다 먼저, 엘프들은 알드메리스를 버리고 탐리엘로 떠났다. 레드가드들은 여행을 위해 요쿠다를 파괴했다. 모든 인간들과 엘프들은 탐리엘이 창조의 중심지로서, 최후의 전쟁이 발생할 곳이며, 신들이 로칸을 처벌하고 비밀의 아다만틴 타워를 남겨둔 곳이라는 것을 알고 있었다. 이들 (아카비리)이 탐리엘을 무엇이라 생각하는지는 아무도 모르지만, 자문해 보라. 왜 이들이 탐리엘을 일부러 세 번 혹은 그 이상 침략했겠는가?\n"
"\n"
"아카비르에는 4대 부족 국가가 있다: 카말, 츠아에스치, 탕 모, 카 포'툰이 그것이다. 그들이 탐리엘을 침략하지 않을 때에는, 서로 싸운다.\n"
"\n"
"카말은 \"눈 (Snow)의 지옥\"이다. 그곳에는 악마들이 살며 악마들이 곧 그들의 무리다. 여름이면 악마들이 눈 녹듯이 나와 탕 모를 침략하지만, 용맹한 원숭이 종족이 항상 그들을 퇴치한다. 한 때, 악마의 왕인 아다'숨 디르-카말이 모로윈드를 정복하려 했지만, 알마렉시아와 언더킹이 그를 레드 마운틴에서 죽였다.\n"
"\n"
"츠아에스치는 한 때 (타이거-드래곤 제국이 나타나기 전) 아카비르의 최강대국이던 \"뱀의 왕국\"이다. 뱀 종족은 오래 전에 아카비르의 모든 인간들을 잡아먹었지만, 약간 인간처럼 생겼다. 키가 크고, (무섭기도 하지만) 아름다우며, 황금비늘로 덮혀있고 불사의 존재이다. 이들은 주변 섬들의 고블린들을 노동과 신선한 피를 제공하는 노예로서 지배한다. 츠아에스치의 영토는 광대하다. 탐리엘 주민들은 아카비르라고 하면 뱀 종족을 떠올린다, 왜냐하면 그들이 이전 시대에 4백년 동안 시로딜 제국을 지배했기 때문이다. 그 통치자는 버시듀-샤이에로서, 모락 통 (Morag Tong)에 의해 암살되었다.\n"
"\n"
"탕 모는 \"천개의 원숭이 섬\"이다. 많은 원숭이 종족 혈통이 있고, 모두 친절하고, 용감하며, 단순하다 (게다가 많은 원숭들은 또한 매우 광적이다). 이들은 필요할 때 군대를 양성할 수 있다, 왜냐하면 다른 아카비리 국가들이 자신들을 한 두차례 노예로 부려왔기 때문이다. 뱀들과 악마들 중 누구할거 없이 혐오하지만, 하나만 선택한다면, 아마 \"뱀\"이라 답할 것이다. 한 때 카 포'툰의 호랑이 종족과는 맹렬한 적대관계였지만, 지금은 이들과 동맹을 맺고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"카 포'툰은 \"타이거-드래곤의 제국\"이다. 고양이 종족은 타이거-드래곤인 신 토쉬 라카가 지배한다. 이들은 지금 거대 제국을 형성하고 있으며, 츠아에스치보다 강력하다 (비록 바다에서는 약하지만). 뱀 종족은 모든 인간을 먹은 후, 모든 드래곤을 먹으려 했다. 이들은 레드 드래곤들을 노예로 만들었지만, 블랙 드래곤들은 포'툰 (당시의 명칭)으로 도망쳤다. 대전쟁이 발생했고, 그 결과 고양이 종족과 뱀 종족은 쇠약해졌으며, 드래곤들은 모두 죽었다. 그 이후로 고양이 종족은 드래곤이 되려고 했다. 토쉬 라카는 최초의 드래곤 승계자이다. 그는 세상에서 가장 큰 드래곤이고, 주황색과 검은색을 띠고 있으며, 새로운 사상을 매우 많이 가지고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"\"먼저, 우리는 모든 흡혈귀 뱀들을 없애자\" 라고 토쉬 라카는 말한다. 그 다음 타이거-드래곤 황제는 탐리엘을 침략하기를 원하게 된다."

"My dear Exchequer,\n"
"\n"
"I once again implore you to revisit the levy that has been placed upon myself for this year. I admit that I am a licensed enchanter residing inside the Imperial City. But circumstances have changed, and the business that was once profitable, is now just a drain on my income. \n"
"\n"
"A few years ago, enchanters would take the physical object to be enchanted and, using various ingredients and tools, imbue the object with the necessary mystical powers. Because of this, enchanters only competed with other enchanters who resided in the same city, since most people did not want to carry a sword hundreds of leagues to another enchanter just to save a few gold drakes. Prices for the city could be set at a friendly meeting of three or four enchanters, and a fine profit could be made. As the right of the crown, a hefty levy for allowing us to operate in the city could be assessed.\n"
"\n"
"But now this has all changed. Enchanters now just make a glyph with the desired effect trapped within it. A glyph is just a simple gem that anyone can attach to the pommel of a sword or on a piece of armor. Once attached the magic in the glyph then flows into the item. \n"
"\n"
"Seems simple, doesn't it? Well, this has caused a collapse of the market. Instead of the price for an enchantment being set on a city-by-city basis, all of the enchanters of Tamriel have to compete with each other. A hedge enchanter in Daggerfall can make ten fire glyphs and sell them to a traveling merchant, who brings them to the Imperial City and sells them in the marketplace, at a price much below the price set by the Cyrodilic enchanters. \n"
"\n"
"All this competition means that I now make just a few gold over the cost my materials. And this profit does not cover the levy your office places on me.\n"
"\n"
"Unless your office stops the importation of foreign manufactured glyphs, you must reduce the levy to allow me to stay in business. I will be forced to sell my home of twenty years and take up another profession, perhaps tutoring some merchant's son. \n"
"\n"
"Eagerly waiting your response, \n"

"Ah, fishing, my son. After a hard week of farming, or a long night of being nagged by your wife, there is nothing better than going out for a bit of a fish.\n"
"\n"
"Now just being alone in the wild, listening to the wind in the trees or the waves on the shore, is good enough for most men. Catching anything of worth is typically the furthest from their minds. And of course that means their neighbors and wives think all they did was sleep in the forest. \n"
"\n"
"But true anglers always look to fill up their catch baskets with the largest fish, which can be used for the tastiest dishes. And to do that, you have to know what you are attempting to catch, where they are found and what baits are best to use. Here is a list of common fish found throughout Tamriel:\n"
"\n"
"Slaughterfish and Trodh:\n"
"These fish are found in the foulest waters possible: sewers, fetid swamps, and in pools near decomposing corpses. A favorite of city dwellers who don't want to leave the safety of their walls, these fish are drawn to crawlers and fish roe. \n"
"\n"
"Salmon and River Betty:\n"
"Fresh flowing rivers and streams are the home of these tasty fish. They bite best on baits of insects and small shad. \n"
"\n"
"Spadetail and Silverside Perch:\n"
"Still lakes with deep holes or overgrowth that let these fish stay out of the sun are the preferred locale for these fish. Guts from small frogs, guar and chickens as well as tiny ocean minnows are the best bait for these.\n"
"\n"
"Dhufish and Longfin:\n"
"When you are the by the sea, you should try your hand at catching these beauties. Using common garden worms and small chub will entice the largest of these fish.\n"

"By Helgreir Lute-Voice, Bard of Windhelm\n"
"\n"
"Born in 2E 546 to Queen Mabjaarn Flame-Hair, Prince Jorunn grew up knowing that his elder sister, Nurnhilde, was fated to take the throne. A singer of rare talent in a culture that reveres the power of the human voice, Jorunn studied at Skald's Retreat on the Isle of Gold outside Riften. There he learned all that could be taught by the most renowned bards of the Eastern Kingdom. He was dubbed the \"Skald-Prince\" of Skyrim.\n"
"\n"
"Jorunn spent most of his youth in artistic and philosophical pursuits, cultivating a broad array of artists, artisans, and performers throughout Eastern Skyrim and beyond. He spent time in Mournhold, Stormhold, Sutch, Elinhir, and is even reputed to have visited Solitude, the capital of Western Skyrim, in disguise. Though he claimed to have no interest in politics or the business of rule, his natural leadership qualities made him the unofficial leader of the creative community wherever he found himself. Though he received little formal schooling in the arts of arms and warfare—as little as a prince of the Nords could manage, anyway—traveling across Tamriel was always a dangerous activity. His travels taught him less orthodox ways of dealing with trouble.\n"
"\n"
"Jorunn was in Riften when the Akaviri of Dir-Kamal assaulted the northeast coast of Skyrim in 2E 572. Jorunn and his closest comrades, the \"Pack of Bards,\" fought their way up the coast to Windhelm, arriving just in time to see its gates breached by the Akaviri. Jorunn hurled himself into the fray, street-fighting being something he had experience with, but was unable to prevent the fall of the city and the slaying of Queen Mabjaarn and Nurnhilde, the \"Brief Queen,\" who both went down fighting.\n"
"\n"
"Wounded and devastated, Jorunn barely escaped the sack of Windhelm alive. Feeling for the first time the responsibility of his royal birth, he decided to appeal to the Greybeards for aid, and so made his way, stealthily but quickly, to High Hrothgar. For reasons that have not been divulged, the Greybeards decided to teach the Skald-Prince a thu'um, one that summons a hero from Sovngarde to fight for the Tongue who uses it. But in Jorunn's voice the thu'um became a royal call of valor, and the summoned hero was none other than Wulfharth the Ash-King.\n"
"\n"
"Together Wulfharth and Jorunn, now claiming the title Skald-King, rallied the Nords of Eastern Skyrim, mustering an army from the Rift and the outer regions of Eastmarch, then fortifying Riften. Dir-Kamal, moving south from Windhelm, found Riften defended by angry Nords inspired by the presence of Wulfharth and eager to fight. So Dir-Kamal bypassed Riften and marched on Mournhold, the Akaviri leader assuming that the Nords would be glad to see him go.\n"
"\n"
"That choice was a fatal mistake. Jorunn and Wulfharth led their army in pursuit of the Akaviri force, and a Nord army entered Morrowind for the first time since the Battle of Red Mountain. The Akaviri army was caught at Stonefalls between the Nords and a Dunmer legion led by Almalexia, but the outcome of the great battle hung in the balance—until a surprise intervention from a phalanx of Argonian shellbacks, led by a trio of reptilian battlemages. The Akaviri line was broken and they were driven into the sea, where they drowned by the thousands.\n"
"\n"

"윈드헬름의 음유시인, 류트 목소리의 헬그레이어 지음\n"
"\n"
"2시대 546년, 요룬 왕자는 화염머리 마브잔 여왕의 몸에서 태어났다. 그는 어린 시절부터 자신의 누나인 넌힐데가 왕좌를 이어받을 것이라고 배우면서 자랐다. 인간의 목소리가 가진 힘을 숭배하는 문화에서 남다른 재능을 가진 그는 리프튼 주변 황금의 섬에 위치한 스칼드의 후퇴에서 교육을 받았다. 그곳에서 그는 동부 왕국의 이름난 음유시인들로부터 자신이 배울 수 있는 모든 것들을 배웠다. 그는 스카이림에서 스칼드 왕자라는 칭호를 얻었다.\n"
"\n"
"요룬은 자신의 젊은 시절 대부분을 예술과 철학에 대한 공부와 탐구로 보냈고 동부 스카이림과 그 너머의 여러 예술가, 대장장이, 연기자들을 찾아다니며 지원해주었다. 그는 많은 시간을 모운홀드, 스톰홀드, 서치, 엘린히어에서 보냈으며 서부 스카이림의 수도였던 솔리튜드에도 몰래 변장해서 다녀왔다는 이야기도 있다. 그는 본래 정치와 지배에 관심이 없다고 했으나, 그의 타고난 지도력으로 인해 그는 어느 집단에서든 지도자로 활동하게 되었다. 그는 비록 싸움과 전법에 대한 지식은—적어도 노드들의 기준으로서는—전무했었지만 탐리엘을 여행하는 것은 언제나 위험이 도사리는 일이였고, 그 여행들로 인해 그는 문제를 해결하는 색다른 방법을 배우게 된다.\n"
"\n"
"2시대 572년, 디어-카말의 아카비리가 스카이림의 북동쪽 해안을 공격하기 시작하였을 때 요룬은 리프튼에 있었다. 요룬과 그의 가장 친한 친구들로 이루어진 '음유시인의 집단'이 다 같이 싸우면서 윈드헬름의 해안까지 도달하였을 때, 이미 윈드헬름의 성문들은 아카비리에 의해 무너져 내리고 있었다. 요룬 본인은 어느 정도 거리에서 싸운 경험이 있기에 전장 속으로 몸을 던졌으나 그는 무너지는 도시도, 힘겹게 싸우다가 전사한 마브잔 여왕도, \"단명의 여왕\"이 되어 버린 넌힐데도 구하지 못하였다.\n"
"\n"
"부상을 입고 충격을 받은 요룬은 윈드헬름의 함락에서 간신히 도망칠 수 있었다. 처음으로 왕족으로서의 책임감을 느낀 그는 회색의 현자들에게 찾아가 도움을 구하기로 결정하고, 은밀하지만 빠르게 하이 흐로스가로 향했다. 그곳에서 무슨 일이 있었는지, 무슨 이유 때문인지는 아무도 모르지만 회색의 현자들은 그에게 포효를 가르치기로 결심했고, 소환자의 말에 따라 싸우는 영웅을 소븐가드에서 불러냈다. 하지만 요룬의 포효 소리는 왕가의 용맹한 함성 소리로 변해 버렸고, 잿더미왕 울프하스밖에 불러낼 수 없었다.\n"
"\n"
"요룬은 울프하스와 함께 스스로에게 스칼드 왕이라는 칭호를 붙이고 동부 스카이림의 노드들을 규합하여 군대를 만들었다. 리프트에서 이스트마치의 외곽 지역까지 모두 규합한 후 그는 리프튼을 요새화시켰다. 윈드헬름에서 남부로 향한 디어-카말이 본 것은 잿더미왕 울프하스의 존재로 인해 고양된 노드인들이 격양된 채로 리프튼을 지키는 모습이었다. 그것을 본 딜-카밀은 리프튼을 지나치고 바로 모운홀드로 향했다. 아카비리의 지도자가 사라지는 것을 보고 노드들이 기뻐하리라고 생각했기 때문이었다.\n"
"\n"
"그러나 그 판단은 엄청난 실수였다. 요룬과 울프하스가 이끄는 군대는 아카비리 군대를 추격했고, 붉은 산 전투 이후 처음으로 노드 군대가 모로윈드에 다시 발을 들이게 되었다. 아카비리의 군대는 스톤폴스에 이르러서 노드군과 알말렉시아가 이끄는 던머군 양쪽으로부터 공격을 당했다. 대규모 전쟁의 결과가 어떻게 될지는 미지수였지만, 의외로 파충류 전투마법사 세 명이 이끄는 아르고니안 등껍질전사 무리가 끼어들면서 마무리되었다. 아카비리의 전선은 무너져 내렸고 병력 대부분이 바다로 몰려나 수천 명이 익사하였다.\n"
"\n"
"그렇게 전쟁이 끝나고 잿더미왕의 역할이 전부 끝나자 그는 소븐가드로 돌아갔다. 그리고 3주 후, 요룬은 윈드헬름에 있는 왕의 궁정의 알현실에서 하이킹으로서 왕관을 이어받았다."

"Such was my rage that I sought the Daedra, who came to me, offering a pact for my talents. They would capture my tormentors and imprison them here. In return, I would build for them. I accepted gladly. \n"

"In Wayrest, I designed inescapable prisons for law enforcement, opaline palaces for the nobles of the Gardens District. My works were heralded as a crossing of artistic perfection and architectural function. But what I've built for the planes of Oblivion are so much more. Black spires for the Scheming Lord of Coldharbour are instruments of torture as much as they are monuments to his greatness. The razor pits of Deadlands never dull, and cut flesh, bone, and spirit essence for the Prince of Destruction—in ways that even the most powerful healers can never mend.\n"
"\n"
"Even so, all of these creations—from the gestating cyst-towers of Molag Bal to the sparkling Pellingare Manor in Wayrest—are but baubles compared to the Vaults. They are my Daedric Crescent, my Akaviri Warblade, the culmination of my skill, my greatest creation.\n"
"\n"
"And they grow only more extraordinary with time. What was once a place of eternal anguish for the three charlatans who ruined my mortal life has grown to become a nexus of torture for all manner of Tamrielic souls. So exquisite is the work I do in these Vaults that even the Daedric Princes send souls to me to oversee.\n"

"Pardon the lengthy discussion of morality to follow. We shall reach the meat of this meal—the actual procedure of soul-trapping—soon enough. I was compelled to include an introductory chapter to this revised version of \"Soul-Trapping\" after the ethical arguments that sprang from the publication of the first edition.\n"
"\n"
"Soul-trapping is the art of taking a creature's soul upon death and confining it in an appropriately-sized phylactery. Throughout the history of magic, mages and philosophers alike have battled back and forth about the morality of the art.\n"
"\n"
"Some mages would argue that, once dead and soul-trapped, a creature's spirit is merely an echo of its previous life, no longer aware of what goes on around it. Even those rare individuals who become phantasmal hunters lurking the darkness of Tamriel are nothing more than predators acting on natural impulses. To these mages, once dead, an individual loses some spark, some intangible element in biological death, that cannot be regained. As such, they argue, soul-trapping is not unethical. In fact, it's a waste of resources to leave the soul of the deceased free.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, we the living, being still alive, can never know for certain. Theories regarding the afterlife are myriad, but even the most powerful mages in Tamriel have never returned from death's reach to report their level of awareness in that state. As such, there are those in the communities of Tamriel, both magical and not, that decry the use of soul-trapping spells. The eccentric Archmagus Elomion of the First Era famously asked, \"Would you like to spend your afterlife powering my levitation staff?\" The Archmagus claimed to never have used a soul-trapping spell in all his years.\n"
"\n"
"Adding some weight to that argument is the rumor that one such soul has retained a very mortal sentience in its entrapment. If rumors are true, the Altmeri royalty have utilized an advanced form of soul-trapping to imprison some ancient High Kinlord for the duration of his afterlife (perhaps one of the Rilises—that lot is notoriously manic, and their souls must be doubly so). The High Kinlord has reportedly maintained his (its?) faculties, taunting and jeering his keepers on a daily basis. I don't know where this Kinlord might be, and I don't want to know. I'd like to keep my head. But his very existence speaks to how aware a soul can be, and the morality of soul-trapping can be further postulated from there.\n"
"\n"
"What do I believe about the subject? I've written ten volumes on trapping souls: instructional, theoretical, and historical in nature, and I cannot answer that question. It is my belief that you won't be able to, either. But what you can answer is whether the material I teach in the following volumes is worth using. All I ask is that you read them."

"You have your orders, Alduril, and you'll execute them as well as you always do, but I wanted to apologize again for this assignment. It would never have been necessary had the Canonreeves not dissolved my plans for a garrison at Tempest Island. I had drawn requisitions to bring a fleet of Swan Ships—enough to repel any force of long-range vessels from Pyandonea—to defend the island. The request was denied.\n"
"\n"
"\"We can deal with the Maormer after the Pact and the Covenant,\" they said, citing a lack of resources to devote to my \"unfounded apprehension.\" So I reminded a few acquaintances of favors owed from conflicts long past and managed to send a few scout ships.\n"
"\n"
"They reported unusual weather phenomena the first week, swift lightning storms off the coast that came and went in moments. The second week, the storms intensified, and under cover of inclement weather came a fleet of warships, chitinous hulls with opalescent sails, decks illuminated with the sparks of lightning staves and swords—Maormer war materiel, just as we remember them. My scouts estimated their force is small, not a full-scale invasion fleet, but the coast of Malabal Tor will be entirely at their mercy when they decide to attack.\n"
"\n"
"Had the Canonreeves taken just a moment from their maps tracking the movements of Orcs and Men, they'd see that a dire threat was growing under their noses. Every week my scouts reported an increase in Maormer strength, a few ships every few days, appearing under the cover of some kind of weather magic. Months too late, the Canonreeves agree with me, now.\n"
"\n"
"I know we ask much from you and your soldiers, but if you don't stop them, Alduril, the Dominion will have yet another front to fight in this war. More than any Daedra, more than the Ebonheart Pact, more than the Daggerfall Covenant, the Maormer want the Altmer choked from existence. They always have.\n"

"\n"
"It is popular belief that all undead and phantasmal revenants are slaves to their necromantic biology. Indeed, like most predatory wildlife, many of these creatures exist only to absorb or consume the energy of the living. They should never be bargained or reasoned with. An Altmer should deal with such creatures in the way she would handle a rabid wolf, or malevolent Orc: with extreme prejudice.\n"
"\n"
"However, there are those among the post-living that possess or have achieved sentience, like vampires, liches, and wraiths. Dialogue is possible with creatures such as these, as long as one keeps certain discretions in mind:\n"
"\n"
"1.\tAn undead who speaks is bound to be powerful. Any creature whose magic is potent enough to allow it sentience in death deserves an Altmer's begrudging admiration.\n"
"\n"
"2.\tAn undead can never be trusted. Though we should respect the undead and their power, all undead want something from the living, and there is little to stop them from taking it. An Altmer must remain guarded in their presence. Always.\n"
"\n"
"3.\tAn undead might not be as she appears. Many powerful mages possess illusory spells to alter their appearance, and so, too, do the undead. The wandering spirit of a lost child could be a starving lich in disguise.\n"
"\n"
"That said, there is much an Altmer can learn from the accumulated knowledge of a sentient undead, if dialogue can be achieved. The discerning Altmer could learn of ancient spells from time immemorial, first-hand accounts of historical events, or the locations of lost relics—if said Altmer can pose salient questions. When conversing with the likes of the undead, an Altmer wants to maintain an appearance of:\n"
"\n"
"1.\tHumility. An Altmer's heritage should afford her much, and in an ideal world, all peoples, including liches, vampires, and wraiths, would adhere to the Altmeri concept of class and proceed accordingly. However, most undead, even Altmeri undead, rarely adhere to social conventions. As such, even the most well-bred of Altmer should refer to point 1 in the previous listing. Think of the undead as elders: powerful, unflinching, and prone to anger.\n"
"\n"
"2.\tIntelligence. As is true with the Altmer, especially well-bred Altmer, the undead do not suffer fools. Without being overtly obvious, an Altmer wants to seek openings to display magical acumen or cunning to show that she is not to be trifled with. Again, think of intimidating a stern elder into compliance.\n"
"\n"
"3.\tDiscipline. Assuming an Altmer can enter into peaceful communication with a lich, wraith, vampire, or otherwise, she will undoubtedly have many questions. But she should be wary of the number of questions she asks. An undead will impart its knowledge willingly or not at all.\n"
"\n"
"In Part II of this collection, I'll detail hurdles that may come up in conversation with the undead, specifically with wraiths, vampires, and liches, all of which require different operations of social intelligence."

"This collection contains privileged information regarding the Daedric Prince Mehrunes Dagon. In case you've been living in an Ayleid ruin since the dawn of recorded history, involvement with Dagon and his ilk is frowned upon quite fiercely by most populations of Tamriel. Having this book or its companion volume in your possession could earn you suspicion from your neighbors as well as agents of the law. In many districts worship of the Master of Razors is illegal, and communion rituals involving the Daedric Prince are punishable by death.\n"
"\n"
"Amongst even the Daedric Princes, none are more openly concerned with the suffering of mortals. Whenever Dagon appears he leaves destruction in his wake, and contact with the Master of Razors often results in death for the conjurer—along with everyone in the vicinity. Sudden floods, thunderstorms, and other natural disasters all over Tamriel have been tied to communions with Mehrunes Dagon, and the most detailed account I've read about occurred in Eastmarch.\n"
"\n"
"Hranvard Frostfinger, a witch of Eastmarch, is said to have sacrificed thirteen innocents to Dagon in a single night, prompting the Daedric Prince to briefly open a portal from the Deadlands to Skyrim. The only witnesses were members of the Direfrost family, a clan of witch-hunters, who managed to find and slay Hranvard. Immediately following, they came under a mysterious and brutal attack themselves. Their leader, Yllothon, was the only survivor, who later wrote in his memoirs:\n"
"\n"
"\"We followed the stench of burning flesh for a half-mile, and we caught up to (Hranvard) at nightfall, by the Sea of Ghosts. She lay cackling among her thirteen victims, whose bodies had been stacked in a mass grave, encircled by spidery writing. Slaying her was an easy task—all it took was a single silver bolt. But when the deed was done, the air suddenly began to boil and crack. Fearing some residual spell, I had my men retreat up the nearest pass, where we watched the snow below catch fire, and the sky split apart with flame. We turned to flee, but it was too late. Fire poured from the wound in the air and engulfed my thirty men. I tried to help them but the flames wouldn't die, and wouldn't burn my flesh. A voice bellowed from the burning maw above, 'You will suffer better among the living.'\" \n"
"\n"
"Many, including members of the Mages Guild, are skeptical of Yllothon's story, respected as he was amongst the Direfrost hunters. They found no sign of Mehrunes Dagon at the Sea of Ghosts—save the blasted, mirrored sand. Obviously, the Direfrosts disagree: there was still the matter of thirty missing hunters. The Direfrosts have since intensified their war against the covens of Eastmarch.\n"
"\n"
"The Mages Guild, however, has struck the event from their records of note, citing the blasted sand at the Sea of Ghosts as a meteorological phenomenon. But I believed Yllothon was correct; I was there, as a senior advisor on the party that surveyed that beach.\n"
"\n"
"Volume II of this collection contains a detailed account of everything I found at the Sea of Ghosts, including half of the \"spidery circle\" that Yllothon describes. Any aspiring conjurer who wants a chance at contacting Mehrunes Dagon should follow me there."

"\n"
"Building a fort in a swamp is no trivial task, but my men and I have accomplished it with Arx Corinium. It was a battle the entire duration—with insect-borne disease, with the wildlife of the marshlands, but the Empire wanted a foothold in this region and we provided one.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, as of this writing, we've packed our arms and armor on orders from Colonel Marianus, and prepare to leave our work behind. The Colonel cites the continued loss of a half-dozen soldiers every month in maintaining Arx Corinium as \"detrimental to the war effort.\" I agree, and would note that I predicted this outcome when we arrived over a year and a half ago. I said as much to the Colonel, who ordered that the project proceed. This isn't a statement of complaint, but of fact.\n"
"\n"
"Construction suffered numerous complications: the bog impeded our progress at every turn, and it became clear the initial foundation we built would sink after the first month. When we moved our location farther to the north, we met a fierce wamasu that cost me ten men to chase off the premises. After repeated encounters, our war wizard, Belisaro, named it Ganakton the Tempest, after the bolts of lightning that the beast emits from every orifice (\"Ganakton\" was the moniker of a hated aunt, rumored to possess Orcish blood).\n"
"\n"
"The dense humidity was another foe, turning our plate armor to steel barrels full of sweat during the early months of construction. It goes against regulation, but I allowed my soldiers the luxury of cloth armor during the summer. It was that or death from heatstroke. We would have been at a disadvantage had we come under attack, but any enemy marching towards Arx Corinium would be half-dead by the time they reached us. In any event, it never happened.\n"
"\n"
"Battle found us just the same: every beast in this swamp, large or small, is a walking death trap, and some days, we fought sword to stinger with insects the size of a grown man's head. Other days, our mages contended with the likes of Ganakton the Tempest, who continued to terrorize the fort. He razed the eastern wall a dozen times, and I regret that I will never be allowed the luxury of mounting his skull on my mantle. But if it means we finally get to leave, I'll gladly allow Ganakton his life.\n"
"\n"
"As I look back on this last year and a half, at the resources and manpower it took to construct Arx Corinium, I can't say it's been worth it. Again, this isn't a statement of grievance. I bear my superiors no ill will for my orders. However, I would note that I made several warnings in advance of this project, and have compiled copies of my letters to my immediate superior, Colonel Marianus, detailing the reasons why I believed the construction of Arx Corinium could prove a disastrous venture for the Empire.\n"
"\n"
"I want to clarify that this is not a declaration of failure on anyone's part, either for myself, my men, or Colonel Marianus. I am fully aware that that decision falls to Tribune Hilario, whom I encourage to read the letters I mention above. I've already sent word and made them available for any officer to peruse at the Imperial City military archives."

"1. 흰색이나 황색으로 빛나는 수정체는 시설에 들이지 말 것.\n"
"\n"
"이 조항은 우리가 우울한 곳을 좋아해서 있는 것이 아니다, 얼간아. 죄수들이 특정한 스펙트럼의 빛을 자신에게 유리하도록 왜곡시킬 수 있기 때문이다. 반드시 조명으로 푸른 수정체를 이용해라. 진짜 불꽃이면 더 좋고.\n"
"\n"
"2. 죄수들을 고문하지 말 것.\n"
"\n"
"이건 그 엘프 왕도 포함된다. 아니, 이유는 모르겠지만, 그냥 그렇게 하는거다. 소문으로는 공포의 군주께서 그 빛나는 쌍년을 위해 뭔가 고약한 깜짝 선물을 준비하고 계시고, 그년을 섬기는 온전한 하인이 필요하다더군. 진짜인지는 나도 모른다.\n"
"\n"
"3. 있었던 곳은 자기가 치울 것.\n"
"\n"
"이곳은 최고 등급 보안 시설이고, 따라서 소울 쉬리븐은 청소부일지라도 들어올 수 없다. 네가 어질러 놓은 것은 네가 치워라. 이건 대련 연습을 하면서 흘린 체액도 포함된다. 내가 또 다시 바닥 돌에서 얼룩을 발견하게 되면, 누군가는 다음 근무를 상처의 고리에서 하게 될 줄 알아라."

"Raw Materials for the Great Shackle:\n"
"\n"
"Supplies of ebony-alloy cold-iron are stable at 17,500 tons, but that's barely enough to forge the Shackle, given typical rate of loss in the casting process. It might be wise to send for another 2,000 tons from the mine burrows in the side of the Mountainous Corpse of the Iron Colossus. Better safe than sorry. \n"
"\n"
"I am honored to report that we have discovered the source of the depletion in the supplies of the Charcoal of Remorse: cinder-imps had been getting into the vault through a forgotten plasm-duct and gorging on the C of R. (We learned this when we found one so bloated it was unable to get back through the duct opening.) We sent in an explosive duct-worm, which found the nest and discorporated all the cinder-imps. Deficits in the supply of Charcoal of Remorse have been made up by increasing Torment Quotas on the Kothringi Soul Shriven.\n"
"\n"
"I don't wish to be one to point talons, but it is my duty to report that even if the Shackle is forged according to schedule, we will not be able to quench it if we do not receive our shipment of the Blood of a Thousand Innocents. We have gotten repeated assurances from Exsanguinator Thartantix that our shipment will be on its way \"any shift now,\" but so far all we've received are promises. I hesitate to elevate this to the Overkyn level, but I think it's high time the matter was looked into."

"In my travels I came upon the land of Clickyville, a place ripe with the fruits of the earth and free from the grip of tyranny. Though the land was not fully formed, and was so underpopulated as to make me feel lonesome at all hours, I decided to settle down in the little town.\n"
"\n"
"I explored its abandoned buildings, its thriving marketplace, its bountiful farms. But my favorite place, the one I frequented most often, was that of the fishing-hole near the graveyard. Its quiet beauty and calm waters did wonders for my soul.\n"
"\n"
"I spent many days fishing there, simply enjoying the quiet and peace. It was on such day that I first saw it - the figure of a stag, barely visible against the grass opposite the docks. Having never seen another animal in all of Clickyville, I was naturally startled, but the beast did not seem to mind. It merely stood there, surveying its territory. As I approached it, however, it bounded off - startled by my movements, I suspect. \n"
"\n"
"That was not the last I saw of the ghostly stag, but it did not appear everyday. Rather, its appearance continued to be a rarity, visiting perhaps once a week.There were times I had company on the docks, and the stag would show itself to me, but not to my companion, or the stag would reveal itself to him and not to me.  I never was able to approach it without it starting, and so I resolved to enjoy its company at a distance, whenever it would see fit to grant it. I feel that I will never understand the ghostly stag fully."

"여행 도중 클리키빌이란 땅을 발견했다. 토지에는 열매가 싱싱하게 자라고 억압적인 지배도 존재하지 않는 곳이었다. 비록 땅이 완전히 형성되지는 않고 인구가 적어서 언제나 쓸쓸했지만, 나는 이 작은 도시에 정착하기로 마음먹었다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 버려진 건물과 그곳의 활기가 넘치는 시장, 비옥한 농장들을 둘러보았다. 하지만 내가 가장 자주 들르던 곳은 묘지 근처에 있는 낚시터였다. 고요한 아름다움과 잔잔한 물이 내 영혼에 경외심을 불러일으켰다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 그곳에서 자주 낚시를 하면서 침묵과 평화를 즐겼다. 어느 날 부두 맞은 편 잔디에 희미하게 사슴이 있는 것을 처음으로 목격했다. 그 동안 클리키빌에서 다른 동물을 본 적이 없어서 놀랏지만, 그 짐승은 나를 신경쓰지 않는 것 같았다. 그저 거기 서서 땅을 바라볼 뿐이었다. 하지만 내가 가까이 가자 달아나 버렸다. 내 움직임에 놀란 듯했다.\n"
"\n"
"그 유령 사슴을 본 게 그걸로 끝은 아니다. 하지만 매일 나타나지는 않았다. 오히려 일주일에 한 번 볼 정도로 보기 드물었다. 내가 부두에 누군가와 동행했을 때는 나에게 모습을 드러냈지만 동행인에게는 보이지 않았다. 그런가 하면 동행인에게는 보이지만 나에게는 보이지 않는 적도 있었다. 사슴에게 가까이 다가가려고 해 봤지만 언제나 실패했다. 그래서 결국 적당한 거리까지만 다가가서 그 존재를 느끼는 걸로 만족하기로 했다. 나는 유령 사슴을 결코 완전히 이해하지 못할 것 같다."

"They are similar, and I suppose the secret group changes the sequence for their rituals, but it clearly has something to do with the clans of Old Orsinium, for the plaques are scattered throughout this ruin. We already tried the same combination as the first gate, but of course it did not work. \n"

"My thought is that this gate would have something to do with the eventual fall of this city. Garhek has an old treatise that variously claims that Bagrakh and Igrun had started raiding indiscriminately. But then it contradicts itself, saying one raided, but the rulers of the city refused to curb them and in fact took credit for the acts. \n"

"We know they holed up in the old city. How did they eat? I hope more is revealed once we get in. And there is, I believe an old symbol for Clan Farhun. That must be wrong though, i don't think they were one of the clans in Old Orsinium thousands of years ago. \n"
"\n"
"… I wish Garhek would get back soon. Ever since we lost Mathriga to spider's poison, I have been questioning our expedition. We should have saved more money and brought hunters or mercenaries to help explore. I should not panic. Not yet.\n"
"\n"
"….. I think that Garhek isn't coming back. Not because he wouldn't want to, but because he can't. I wanted to write the definitive book on the Rise and Fall of Old Orsinium. But this place… I fear I led my friends and myself to a premature end in an old ruin that keeps its secrets."
