"\nBackground:"
"\nHow this disease began and spread is a mystery. By gathering information, I hope to resolve the issue."
"\n"
"\nArgonians appear immune to the flu. This has caused conjecture that they actually introduced the flu to retaliate for years of slavery at the hands of the Dark Elves. These claims have never been proven or disproven, and they require more research."
"\n"
"\nMitigation:"
"\nMethods that slowed the rapid spread of the flu included burning the belongings of infected people (which, unfortunately, sometimes including burning remaining family members); segregating the sick into ghettos (or walling them up); or putting the diseased onto ships and setting them adrift. Normal curative spells and elixirs were inconsistent in their ability to cure the flu. "
"\n"
"\nSymptoms and Course: "
"\nGeneral malaise, loss of appetite, and fatigue begins several hours before an afflicted victim develops other symptoms. The afflicted person's eyes water constantly. Skin develops a bright red granular rash that does not itch. "
"\n"
"\nWithin twenty-four to thirty-six hours, victims suffer nosebleeds, their tears contain blood, and a granular rash spreads over their bodies. At this point, victims develop a deep, raspy cough. Within thirty-six to forty-eight hours, the victims' coughs produce bloody phlegm. "
"\n"
"\nIn most cases, death takes place in as little as seventy-two hours after the initial onset, but some victims have lingered for five to seven days."
"\n"
"\nTreatment: "
"\nWhen the Knahaten Flu first spread, it seemed unstoppable. No reliable treatment against it has ever been proven."
"\n"
"\nTen years ago, a young Redguard named Perizada claimed she'd had a vision from the Divines. She replicated the cure from this dream, testing it on a village scheduled to be razed (together with its inhabitants). Her cure worked, and the village was saved."
"\n"
"\nThe cure required clannfear claws boiled in salt water. The patient would then drink the liquid. The increased trade of actual and purported clannfear claws on the black market caused prices to soar wildly. So many false cures had proven fatal that Perizada's cure was never officially sanctioned. As Perizada later died of the flu herself, its efficacy was eventually considered dubious at best."
"\n"
"\nThe "Clannfear Cure" has given rise to many other supposed cures, all of which involve boiling something in a liquid and then drinking the result. For the poorest of the population, chicken broth proved not only cheap, but easily obtained. It typically soothed their coughs, which in turn allowed patients to breathe more easily. "
"\n"
"\nChicken broth is definitely not a guaranteed cure, but it is certainly the most accessible. It is recommended, should this dread disease ever return."
"\n"
"\nAs the granular skin rash was non-irritating, many left it untreated. Those whose rash remained covered—whether in bandages, poultices, or simply clothing—seemed less likely to infect those who attended them. This also accounts for the much slower spread of the disease in colder climates and during winter months."
"\n"
"\nHave you heard of other cures? If so, please submit your reports directly to me for further investigation."

"\n"
"\n"Thanks for your help," the Argonian trader said. He nodded at the Kothringi and lumbered away with his cart."
"\n"
"\nFor several months, the same trader came to Zuuk bearing loads of hay for the horses. Maakul's brother Huug, before he died, had handled the transactions. He arranged deliveries, unloaded the bales, and made payments. Then the illness struck Huug: a rash that stood out as bright spots against his skin together with a high fever. Within a week, he was gone."
"\n"
"\nAnd now, Maakul dealt with the trader. If only his muscles didn't hurt so much. Clearly, he lacked the strength of his late brother. He'd need to try harder, though he preferred studying and reading to any physical labor."
"\n"
"\n"I need to check the ledgers anyway," Maakul said to himself as he headed into his hut. He'd let the books go during his brother's illness, and the latest delivery should be entered."
"\n"
"\nAs he opened the payment register, a slip of paper fluttered to the floor. He recognized his brother's handwriting and picked it up."
"\n"
"\n"Beware the ruby necklace." "
"\n"
"\nMaakul frowned. They couldn't afford necklaces, much less rubies. What did his brother mean? Shrugging, Maakul threw the crumpled note into the brazier beside his desk, draped a cloak over his legs, and settled down to bring their accounts up to date. He felt so cold."
"\n"
"\nThat night, Maakul saw his reflection in his wife's concerned face. She'd found him, coughing and shivering at his desk. She half-carried him to bed. A line of red welts, the tell-tale rash, encircled his throat."
"\n"
"\n"Rubies," he mumbled, clawing at his skin as the Knahaten Flu claimed its latest victim."

msgid "Gold exchanged hands, marking the deal complete. Makes-Many-Waves belonged to a new master."
"\n"
"\nSendrasa Llarys watched as her newest acquisition joined the group she'd already purchased. She stared so long at Makes-Many-Waves that she drew the Argonian's eyes to hers. They both looked away quickly, almost instantly. Eye contact between master and slave would be punished by ten lashes."
"\n"
"\nThe distance between market and house was no more than seven miles, but it seemed an eternity to Sendrasa. She'd counted the years impatiently until she could set up her own household and bring Makes-Many-Waves home."
"\n"
"\n"Send the rest to the field house," Sendrasa said. Her footman assisted her from her horse. "I want that one," she waved a hand towards Makes-Many-Waves, "brought to my sitting room. She'll be my personal assistant.""
"\n"
"\n"As you wish, madam.""
"\n"
"\nPulling her gloves off as she strode into her home, Sendrasa laughed. "Finally, yes! It will be exactly as I wish.""
"\n"
"\nHow long since she'd felt her lover's lips pressed against hers? Shared in desperate, guilty caresses whenever they could steal away together? How she'd suffered once their intimacy became known! As though, Sendrasa thought bitterly, seeing her beloved sold through the Archeins hadn't been punishment enough."
"\n"
"\nTime passed with deadly slowness from that moment until Sendrasa finally located Makes-Many-Waves and bought her back. This time, no one could separate them. They belonged together."
"\n"
"\nThe door opened, and Makes-Many-Waves stepped forward, eyes downcast becomingly. Sendrasa walked past her, shut and locked the door, then turned."
"\n"
"\n"I've missed you," she said softly."
"\n"
"\nIn a moment, they locked in a passionate embrace, Sendrasa touching Makes-Many-Waves's scales gently, searchingly."
"\n"
"\n"Did they torture you, darling? I swear they'll pay!""
"\n"
"\nMakes-Many-Waves shook her head, her frilled spine fluttering. "Seeing you heals me, my love. But the Archeins ….""
"\n"
"\n"You're safe. Those traitors won't touch you again," Sendrasa said."
"\n"
"\n"Listen, my love," Makes-Many-Waves said. "Your parents paid the Archeins very, very well. Their eyes are everywhere. They'll know you bought me, and they'll come for me.""
"\n"
"\n"I'll free you," Sendrasa replied. "You'll be safe!""
"\n"
"\n"It's not like that," the Argonian whispered. "The Archeins don't care whether Argonians they sell are free or not. To live together safely, we must leave Morrowind. ""
"\n"
"\n"I see. Now kiss me.""
"\n"
"\nAs darkness approached, Sendrasa and Makes-Many-Waves began their journey, heading northwest toward the border with Skyrim."
"\n"
"\n"Is Riften safe?" Makes-Many-Waves whispered. They'd traveled several days out of their way to shake off any possible followers."
"\n"
"\nBefore Sendrasa could speak, an arrow pierced her throat. She clutched at it with one hand, her eyes widened in surprise. More arrows followed swiftly, killing the Dark Elf long before she slid to the ground."
"\n"
"\n"You're free now," said an Argonian archer, stepping from the shadows."
"\n"
"\nMakes-Many-Waves stared at him, unable to speak or move."
"\n"
"\n"Did she hurt you?" he asked, coming closer. "You can return to Black Marsh now. You're no longer a slave.""
"\n"
"\nCollapsing across Sendrasa's body, Makes-Many-Waves sobbed."

"\n"
"\nWhen he could no longer move, Scale-Song bowed his head, listening to the moisture dripping from the roots twisted above him. Soon, it would be over. He would return to the Hist. How embarrassing, though, for an Argonian to suffocate in mud."
"\n"
"\nHis eyes opened suddenly. He'd had the same dream every night for weeks. Each night, he felt he was nearly at the cave's exit. Everything would be made clear once he reached it. And each morning, Scale-Song awoke, no closer to understanding the meaning of the imagery."
"\n"
"\n"Clearly, the Hist speaks to you," said his egg-brother Gash-Tail. "Tonight, ask what it wants. Talk to it.""
"\n"
"\n"I'll try," said Scale-Song, "but I never remember it's a dream until I'm awake.""
"\n"
"\nGash-Tail reached into an earthenware jar on the shelf beside him. He handed Scale-Song a thick roll of leaves tied with twine."
"\n"
"\n"Burn this," he said. "The incense may clear your mind. If the Hist wants you, you must listen.""
"\n"
"\nScale-Song nodded. Advice like this was precisely why he sought Gash-Tail's help. For the first time in a long while, he couldn't wait for night to fall."
"\n"
"\nThe burnt incense filled his hut with thick gray smoke that coiled heavily along the ground like fog. Scale-Song hadn't expected it to smell so horribly. Still, he watched the smoke spread slowly throughout the room, his eyelids growing heavier and heavier."
"\n"
"\nA cave. A tunnel? Smoke drifted along the muddy floor. Scale-Song stopped running and reached out a hand toward the smoke. Talk. Ask. Speak."
"\n"
"\n"Are you trying to tell me something?" he asked aloud."
"\n"
"\n"I am dead.""
"\n"
"\n"Dead? Who are you?""
"\n"
"\nThe smoke coalesced into a shimmering figure, hooded and cloaked. Its tail twitched. "I am dead," the figure said. "Without it, all that I am will be lost forever. Find it. Remember.""
"\n"
"\n"It? What is it?""
"\n"
"\nScale-Song followed the figure through the dark passage. His feet no longer sank into the mire, as in all the other dreams. They walked in silence. Scale-Song was alert, but untroubled."
"\n"
"\nIt seemed like hours before the pair reached the tunnel's exit. The shimmering figure sighed deeply, pointing toward a shriveled tree."
"\n"
"\n"A Hist," said Scale-Song, surprised. "Is this it? Dead … but how?""
"\n"
"\n"Remember," said the figure, unfurling into the wind, but not before it pressed a Mnemic Egg into Scale-Song's hands."

"\n"
"\nWhen the dust settled, Lormingga realized she was alone. Only the smear of blood on the floor beside her indicated where her companion had fallen. As her eyes adjusted to the darkness, Lormingga looked around carefully. Alone. She lifted her unbound hands to her face and prayed."
